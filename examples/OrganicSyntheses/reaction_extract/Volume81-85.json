The reaction mixture is stirred in the dark for 3 days, after which an additional 3.3 g (22 mmol) of NaI is added and stirring is continued for an additional day (Note 10). The reaction mixture is then suction filtered through a sintered glass funnel and the filtrate is collected in a one-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask. The solid is washed with acetone until it is colorless. The solid is discarded and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (Note 11). The residual yellow oil is partitioned between 150 mL of diethyl ether and 60 mL of 1M sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) solution.

The flask is evacuated to 0.03 mm and heated with a heat gun for 10 min, flushed three times with argon, and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Dimethylformamide (1 mL) (Note 14) is added via syringe, and then a solution of 10.8 g (33 mmol) of iodide 3 in 14 mL of DMF is added dropwise via syringe to the well-stirred suspension of zinc dust. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min at 0\u00b0C to produce a solution of the zinc reagent and a suspension of excess zinc dust. The ice bath is removed and 7.9 g (30 mmol) of methyl 4-iodobenzoate (Note 15), 0.137 g (0.15 mmol) of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0), and 0.183 g (0.6 mmol) of tri-o-tolylphosphine are added. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 60\u00b0C for 5 hr. The resulting mixture is poured into a conical flask containing 300 mL of water. An additional 100 mL of 10% citric acid solution is added in order to break the black emulsion. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 150-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are washed with two 100-mL portions of water and 100 mL of brine. At this point, the organic extracts are decanted from a black solid [consisting of palladium and zinc(0), together with a bright white solid; (Note 16)], dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to yield 9.1 g of a pale yellow solid. This material is purified by column chromatography (Note 17). The product is charged on a column of 200 g of silica gel (Sorbent 60A, 32-63 \u00b5m) and eluted with 1 L of 20% EtOAc-hexane. At that point, fraction collection (25-mL fractions) is begun, and elution is continued with 500 mL of 25% EtOAc-hexane and then 200 mL of 30% EtOAc-hexane. The desired product is collected in fractions 13-59 which are concentrated by rotary evaporation to yield 3.5-3.9 g (35-39%) of 4 as a white solid (Note 18)."

A flame-dried, 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter is charged with 10.0 g (0.100 mol) of 5-hexen-1-ol, 15.2 g (0.151 mol) of triethylamine, and 500 mL of dichloromethane (Note 1). The flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath (0 to \u22125\u00b0C) for 30 min and then 9.3 mL (0.12 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride (Note 2) is added dropwise via the addition funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred at \u22125 to \u221210\u00b0C for an additional 1 hr before being transferred to a cold 1-L separatory funnel and washed successively with 150 mL of cold water, 150 mL of cold 10% (ca. 3.3N) aqueous hydrochloric acid, 150 mL of cold, saturated, aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and 150 mL of cold brine (Note 3). The organic layer is dried over MgSO4 and then divided into three portions (Note 4). One portion is filtered into a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 8-10 mm in a 20-25\u00b0C water bath, and this is repeated with the remaining two portions to give the desired mesylate as a clear, pale-yellow oil (Note 5).\nDry acetone (200 mL) and then 18.5 g (0.12 mol) of anhydrous sodium iodide (Note 6) are added to the above 300-mL flask, which is then equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a Friedrichs condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The pale-yellow solution is stirred in the dark under a positive pressure of nitrogen at gentle reflux for 4 hr (Note 7). The resulting mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the acetone is then removed by rotary evaporation at 8-10 mm in a 20-25\u00b0C water bath. The residue is partitioned between 50 mL of pentane and 50 mL of 10% aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution by swirling the flask until all of the precipitate dissolves. The aqueous phase is discarded and the organic layer is washed with 50 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 8-10 mm in a 20-25\u00b0C water bath. The residue is then passed through a 60-mL, medium porosity, sintered-glass funnel containing ca. 20 g of alumina (Note 8) using ca. 100 mL of pentane as eluent. The pentane is removed by rotary evaporation at 8-10 mm in a 20-25\u00b0C water bath to give 17.44-17.97 g (83-86% overall from the alcohol) of 1 as a clear, colorless oil (Notes 9 and 10).",

A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 11) equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm), argon inlet adapter, and a rubber septum is flame-dried and allowed to cool to room temperature under a positive pressure of argon. A thermometer is inserted through the septum (Note 12) and the flask is charged with 114 mL of dry, alkene-free pentane and 76 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Notes 13, 14). The solution is cooled to approximately \u221272\u00b0C using a 2-propanol-dry ice bath and 52 mL of a 1.90M solution of tert-butyllithium (t-BuLi) in heptane (98.8 mmol) is added via teflon cannula at a rate of approximately 1.7 mL/min so as to maintain an internal temperature below ca. \u221268\u00b0C (Notes 15, 16). A two-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum and argon inlet adapter is flame-dried under an atmosphere of argon, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then charged with 10.0 g (47.6 mmol) of oxygen-free 6-iodo-1-hexene (1) (Note 17) and 50 mL of dry, alkene-free pentane (Note 14). The iodide solution is cooled to \u221272\u00b0C using a 2-propanol-dry ice bath and then transferred via a teflon cannula under a positive pressure of argon to the stirred, \u221272\u00b0C solution of t-BuLi at a rate of approximately 1.4 mL/min so as to maintain an internal temperature below \u221265\u00b0C (Note 18). The last of the iodide solution is transferred through the cannula by addition of 5 mL of dry pentane to the flask. Upon completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at \u221272\u00b0C for 15 min and the cooling bath is then removed. After 3.5 hr (Note 19), the opaque, pale-yellow solution is cooled to ca. 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, and 4.85 g (47.0 mmol) of benzonitrile (Note 20) is added dropwise via syringe (Note 21). The cooling bath is removed, and the bright-orange solution is allowed to stir for 1 hr. The reaction mixture is then re-cooled in an ice-water bath and 35.0 mL of 10% (ca. 3.3N) aqueous hydrochloric acid is added rapidly via syringe (Note 22). Once the exotherm abates, the cooling bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 2 hr. The contents of the flask are completely transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel by repeated washings with pentane and ether, shaken vigorously, and the aqueous layer is discarded. The organic phase is washed with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4. filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 8-10 mm. Kugelrohr distillation of the residue (bath temperature ca. 180\u00b0C, 5 mm) affords 6.64-6.78 g (75-77 %) of pure 2 as a clear, colorless oil (Notes 10, 23, 24)."

An oven-dried, three-necked, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (with volume graduation) capped with a rubber septum and nitrogen inlet is charged with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (51.2 g, 367 mmol) (Note 1) and 400 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The mixture is cooled to \u221230\u00b0C (internal temperature) in a dry ice-acetone bath and 243 mL of n-butyllithium solution (1.49M in hexanes, 362 mmol) (Note 3) is cannulated directly into the addition funnel from a 1-L sure-seal flask. The n-butyllithium solution is added dropwise to the stirred reaction mixture over 30 min while the temperature is maintained between \u221230 and \u221235\u00b0C resulting in an orange-yellow solution. The addition funnel is washed with two 10-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran and the reaction mixture is stirred an additional 10 min at \u221230\u00b0C before being cooled to \u221276\u00b0C (Note 4). Triisopropyl borate (112 mL, 483 mmol) (Note 5) is cannulated into the addition funnel directly from a sure-seal flask and then added dropwise (Note 6) to the creamy yellow suspension over 20 min while the internal temperature is maintained below \u221273\u00b0C. Ethyl benzoate (35.7 g, 238 mmol) (Note 7) is added via syringe to the addition funnel and added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 10 min, causing a slight reddening of the suspension. The addition funnel is washed with two 10-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 3.5 hr at \u221273\u00b0C. The resulting deep red suspension is taken out of the cooling bath, and after approximately 20 min the internal temperature rises to \u221230\u00b0C. Glacial acetic acid (20.7 mL, 362 mmol) is then added dropwise over 5 min via the addition funnel, causing the internal temperature to rise to \u221210\u00b0C while the color of the reaction mixture changes from red to yellow. The addition funnel is removed, neopentyl glycol (37.1 g, 356 mmol) (Note 8) is added in one portion, and stirring is continued for 2 hr. The mixture is decanted from a white precipitate into a 3-L separatory funnel, and 1 L of dichloromethane is added to the separatory funnel (Note 9).

The resulting suspension is cooled in an ice bath and lithium borohydride (4.12 g, 0.193 mol) is added in several portions via the powder funnel (Note 2) over 30 min. Caution! Extensive foaming due to hydrogen gas evolution. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min. The reaction mixture is then recooled in an ice-bath and quenched by the addition of 4N HCl in dioxane (Note 3) until the mixture stops bubbling (1-2 mL). The mixture is then transferred to a 2-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask and the solvent is concentrated at reduced pressure until a glassy solid is obtained (Note 4). The round-bottomed flask is fitted with a three-way stopcock to which a nitrogen-filled balloon is attached. The solid is then suspended in 100 mL of acetone and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (78 mL, 0.66 mol) (Note 5) is added in one portion. Next, 4N HCl in dioxane (82.5 mL, 0.33 mol) is added slowly with stirring. The reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hr, during which time it becomes bright red in color. If TLC analysis indicates the reaction is not complete (Note 6), then an additional portion of 2,2-dimethoxypropane (13 mL, 0.11 mol) is added and stirring is continued for an additional 6 hr. The solvent volume is then reduced by 80% at reduced pressure and the reaction mixture is slowly poured into 400 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution.

The flask is attached to a rotary evaporator (at atmospheric pressure) and the reaction mixture is stirred at 45\u00b0C for ca. 1.5 hr. At that point, monitoring by TLC indicates that the reaction has progressed approximately halfway to completion. The pressure in the rotary evaporator is then reduced to 1 mm (by attaching it to a vacuum pump in a hood), and the bath temperature is reduced to 40\u00b0C. Under these conditions, full removal of the solvent is achieved in ca. 60 min to yield a highly viscous slurry. This residue is taken up in 200 mL of dichloromethane, stirred for 10 min, and any precipitate is removed by filtration through Celite (Note 11). The filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure, and the residue is crystallized from 120 mL of diethyl ether and dried at 1 mm to give 9.8 g (67%) of the product as a white solid.

After 30 min, the mixture is warmed to 0\u00b0C for 30 min with a change in color to dark brown. The addition funnel is replaced with a rubber septum, and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (44.8 g, 235 mmol) is added in one portion through a funnel. After 10 min, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 1.5 hr. The reaction is quenched by addition of 10 mL of water, stirred for 30 min, and then transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with 250 mL of 10% HCl and 150 mL of 1N NaOH solution. Each of these aqueous extracts is separately back-extracted with 500 mL of Et2O, and the combined organic phases are washed with 100 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4, and filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask for use in the next step.

THF (500 mL) is added to tosylate 3 (76 g, ca 177 mmol) prepared as described above, and the 1-L flask is equipped with a large magnetic stirbar and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The solution is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath at \u221278\u00b0C for 20 min and the addition funnel is charged with 219 mL of BuLi solution (2.5M in hexanes, 548 mmol) which is then added dropwise over ca. 1 hr to the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, the solution is stirred for 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C and warmed over 1 hr to 0\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is then recooled to \u221278\u00b0C. To the resulting black solution of lithium acetylide 4 is then added paraformaldehyde (10.6 g, 354 mmol) (Note 13) in one portion. After 15 min, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 4 hr during which time the suspension of paraformaldehyde gradually dissolves. The reaction is quenched by addition of 200 mL of aqueous ammonium chloride solution, and the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with three 200-mL portions of Et2O. The combined organic extracts are washed with 100 mL of 1N NaOH and 50 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the desired product contaminated with tert-butyldimethylsilanol. The product is purified by fractional distillation (Note 14) to give 21-24 g (44-53% overall from aldehyde 2) of the alcohol 5 as a colorless oil (Notes 15, 16)."

A 2-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar is charged with salicyl alcohol 1 (20.0 g, 161 mmol) (Note 1) and 325 mL of acetonitrile (Note 2). The resulting solution is cooled at 0\u00b0C in an ice bath while freshly generated cyclopentadiene (20 mL, 15.6 g, 236 mmol) (Note 3) is added in one portion. A pressure-equalizing addition funnel is then attached to the flask and charged with a solution of sodium metaperiodate (60 g, 280 mmol) (Note 4) in 220 mL of water. This solution is added dropwise to the ice-cooled, vigorously stirred reaction mixture over a period of 2 hr (Note 5). The color of the reaction mixture initially turns yellow-orange. After the reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for an additional 1 hr, additional cyclopentadiene (10 mL) is added and stirring is continued for 30 min at 0\u00b0C. The ice bath is then removed and after 30 min an additional 10-mL portion of cyclopentadiene (Note 6) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature (Note 7).\nSodium chloride (50 g) is added to the reaction mixture and the suspension is stirred for 1 hr. The reaction mixture is then filtered under vacuum through a 30 \u00d7 35 mm pad of Celite in a sintered glass funnel washing with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. Two phases form in the filtrate. The organic phase is separated and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is combined with the aqueous phase and extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether, and the combined organic phases are washed with 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to afford 32.5 g of an orange-brown oil which is adsorbed onto 25 g of silica gel and charged onto a 430 mm \u00d7 45 mm column of 350 g of 60-120 mesh silica gel. The column is eluted with ca. 700 mL of petroleum ether (bp 60-80\u00b0C) to remove hydrocarbon impurities, and elution is then continued with 500 mL of 98:2 petroleum ether and then with 95:5 petroleum ether:ethyl acetate to give a small amount of salicylaldehyde (Note 8). Further elution with 3.0 L of 95:5 petroleum ether:ethyl acetate gives pure 3. The column is further eluted with 90:10 petroleum ether-ethyl acetate to give 3.5 g of starting material (1). Recrystallization of 3 from a mixture of 25 mL of ether and 15 mL of petroleum ether gives 18.57-19.5 g (61-64%) of pure 3 as a white solid (Note 9)."

Two 100-mL, round-bottomed flasks are connected to a double-ended filter which consists of two chambers, each equipped with a side arm, separated by a glass frit (Note 1). Vacuum grease is used to ensure an air-tight seal and rubber bands are used to secure the flasks to the filter assembly. A magnetic stirbar, (cyclooctadienyl)ruthenium dichloride polymer (0.426 g, 1.5 mmol), and (R)-BINAP (1.00 g, 1.60 mmol) (Note 2) are placed in one flask, and the entire apparatus is evacuated and filled with nitrogen. Toluene (34 mL) and triethylamine (3.4 mL) (Note 2), which have been deoxygenated by nitrogen sparging for several min, are added via the lower side arm. The vessel is sealed and the mixture heated to 140\u00b0C producing a deep brick red colored solution (Note 3). After 4 hr, the apparatus is allowed to cool to room temperature and the reaction mixture is vigorously stirred while the catalyst precipitates. The apparatus is vented to nitrogen and inverted to filter the product using vacuum on the lower side arm and nitrogen on the upper side arm (Note 4). If the frit cakes with product, slowing down filtration, momentarily reversing the flow of nitrogen will lift the cake away from the frit. The precipitate is washed with 34 mL of deoxygenated toluene and the flask containing the filtrate is replaced with an empty one. The entire apparatus is placed under vacuum and the product is dried overnight to give 0.850 g (67%) of a dark red solid (Notes 5, 6).",

The reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath and solid sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (12.6 g, 50.7 mmol) is added in portions over 20 min in order to destroy excess hydrogen peroxide (Note 10). The cooled solution is stirred for 1 hr further, at which point a KI paper assay indicates that the excess oxidant has been completely consumed. The solution is decanted into a 500-mL flask to remove small amounts of undissolved thiosulfate. The solid is washed with 50 mL of MeOH and the methanol extract is added to the reaction solution which is then concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. Dichloromethane (250 mL) is added to the residue and the urea is removed by filtration through cotton and celite. Concentration of the filtrate affords 10.3 g (97%) of the nitrone as a yellow solid (Note 11).\nIf desired, the nitrone can be recrystallized from diisopropyl ether (200 mL) (Notes 12, 13), affording 9.0 g (84%) of a white solid (Note 14). Concentration of the mother liquor and recrystallization of the residue from 40 mL of diisopropyl ether provides 0.600 g of additional nitrone. Total yield: 9.6 g (89%) of the nitrone as a white solid (Note 15)."

The septum is replaced with a 250-mL powder addition funnel charged with 26.7 g (50 mmol) of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) (Note 2). The flask is placed in a water bath at ambient temperature to control the heat evolved from the reaction. To the slowly stirred bromine, hexaphenylbenzene is added slowly over 1 hour (Note 3). The reaction starts immediately as judged by an evolution of gaseous hydrobromic acid (Note 4). After the addition of hexaphenylbenzene is complete, the dark-orange slurry is stirred for an additional 20 min.(Note 5)\nThe bromine slurry of resulting product is carefully poured into 500 mL of pre-chilled (approx. \u221278\u00b0C) ethanol in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask with stirring by a magnetic stir bar (Note 6). To the three-necked flask is added cold (\u221278\u00b0C) ethanol (100 mL \u00d7 2) and the remaining precipitate is transferred to the Erlenmeyer flask. The suspension of the product in ethanol is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2 hrs. with stirring, and the suspension is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel. The pale yellow precipitate is washed with ethanol (50 mL), aqueous sodium bisulfite (5%, 100 mL), and ethanol (2 \u00d7 50 mL) successively. After being dried overnight in vacuo (0.5 mmHg) at room temperature to a constant weight, 47.8 g (96% yield) of hexakis(4-bromophenyl)benzene (HBB) is obtained with greater than >95% purity as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\nThe precipitated product is sufficiently pure for most purposes; however, it can be further purified by re-precipitation from tetrahydrofuran. Thus, 10 g of HBB was dissolved in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (Note 7) (350 mL) in a beaker. Upon slow evaporation at room temperature, the solution yields a colorless (microcrystalline) precipitate (9.4 g) of hexakis(4-bromophenyl)benzene (HBB). (Note 8) (Note 9)."

Alternatively, the enantiomeric excess of the benzyl ester2 could be determined by GC analysis of the corresponding lactone,3 which was obtained by selective reduction of the ester group with lithium triethylborohydride (LiBEt3H) followed by acid-catalyzed lactonization (Note 11).4\nUse of quinine in the ring opening of endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride provides 5.13 g (94%) of the corresponding enantiomeric benzyl hemiester as a white solid (Note 16)."

The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and 30% aq hydrogen peroxide (110 mL, 1.10 mol) (Notes 7 and 8) is added over 20 h by using two syringe pumps (Note 9). Upon the addition of the first few drops of hydrogen peroxide, the color of the mixture changes from dark green to purple, and the purple color deepens during the addition. Reaction progress can be monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Note 10). After 20 h, the reaction is quenched at 0 \u00b0C by adding 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate by syringe pump over 30 min (Note 11). The purple color fades through red to light blue-green. The resulting mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with hexanes (250 mL) and the hexanes wash is added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is shaken, the layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with hexanes (2 \u00d7 250 mL). The combined organic layers are then washed with brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure at 30 \u00b0C or lower. The resulting yellow or brown oil (216-231 g) (Notes 10 and 12) is used without purification for part C (Notes 13 and 14).\nCAUTION: Ammonia is toxic and corrosive and should be used only in a well-ventilated fume hood.\nCAUTION: This procedure generates hydrogen gas and should be performed in a well-ventilated fume hood.\nCAUTION: tert-Butanethiol, although efficiently scavenged, is produced in stoichiometric quantities. It has a foul odor and is the odorant used for natural gas.",
            "C. (RS)-(+)-tert-Butanesulfinamide A 5-L three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (glass rod and glass paddle), a cold finger fitted with a gas inlet, and a Claisen adapter fitted with a glass stopper and a gas outlet connected to a mineral oil bubbler is placed under argon and cooled in a bucket of dry ice/acetone. The cold finger is filled with dry ice/acetone, and the gas inlet is changed from argon to an ammonia cylinder (Note 15). The ammonia gas pressure is adjusted so that most of the ammonia is condensed into the vessel as it passes through the cold finger (Note 16). After about 2 L of ammonia is condensed (about 2.5 h), the mineral oil bubbler is removed from the Claisen adapter gas outlet and replaced with an argon line. The ammonia line is removed from the cold finger gas inlet and replaced with a mineral oil bubbler.\nThe reaction mixture at \u221275\u00b0C (internal temperature) is flushed gently with an argon stream, and Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (1.0 g, 2.48 mmol) (Note 17) is added. The mixture turns brown as dissolution occurs on stirring. The Claisen adaptor is replaced with an adaptor containing a low temperature thermometer. The cooling bath is lowered and pieces of lithium ribbon (17.4 g, 2.50 mol) (Note 18) are added with tweezers in ~1 g portions (Note 19). Each piece is cut in half just prior to addition to ensure fast dissolution and reaction. As each piece of lithium is added, the mixture briefly turns a dark blue color. This fades to give a grey suspension of lithium amide with concomitant evolution of hydrogen gas (Note 19). Once the reaction returns to the grey color, another piece of lithium is added. The dry ice/acetone bath is periodically raised to contact the bottom of the flask to slow the refluxing caused by the formation of LiNH2 (Note 19). After the addition of the lithium is complete (about 1.5 h), the reaction mixture is allowed to reflux for 15 minutes (Note 20), and then submerged in the dry ice/acetone bath.\nAfter cooling to \u221278 \u00b0C (about 30 minutes) and replacement of the thermometer adaptor by an addition funnel, a solution of crude (RS)-(+)-tert-butyl tert-butanethiosulfinate (entire crude product from Step B, 1.00 mol) in 320 mL of freshly distilled, dry THF is added to the vigorously stirring reaction mixture over 45 minutes via the addition funnel (Note 21). The addition funnel is rinsed with a small amount (5-10 mL) of THF and this is added to the reaction mixture. The addition funnel is replaced by the thermometer adaptor. After one hour at \u221278 to \u221272 \u00b0C, the cooling bath is removed, stirring is slowed to the lowest possible rate and the reaction mixture is allowed to slowly warm to room temperature overnight (15 h) under a stream of argon (Note 22).\nThe resulting thick gray mixture, still under an argon stream, is cooled in an ice-water bath. Ice (540 g, 30 mmol) is added in one portion, and the dark green mixture is stirred until it is mostly homogeneous (Note 23). Chloroacetic acid (104 g, 1.10 mol) (Note 24) is added to the ice-cold mixture in five portions over 20 minutes. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight (12 h) at ambient temperature under argon. The claret solution is poured into a 2 L separatory funnel and extracted with methylene chloride (6 \u00d7 1 L). The combined organic layers are dried over Na2SO4, and filtered through a pad of celite. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure. Hexanes (200 mL) are added and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. More hexanes (50 mL) are added and the evaporation is repeated. The resulting yellow-orange solid is triturated (Note 25) with hexanes (250 mL) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. After the solids are crushed, a magnetic stir bar is added and the slurry is stirred for 30 minutes. The solids are collected on a suction filter, washed with hexanes (15 mL), and suction-dried (Note 26). The triturated material is then recrystallized by dissolving it in boiling hexanes (150 mL), followed by slow cooling to room temperature with fast stirring. The crystals are collected by suction filtration and washed with cold hexanes (300 mL, precooled to \u221230 \u00b0C) and suction-dried to provide 84.9-86.9 g (70-72% from di-tert-butyl disulfide) of the desired product (Note 27)."

This salt is dissolved in 35 mL of distilled water and NaBF4 (20.00 g, 182 mmol) (Note 2) is added in portions with stirring over 10-15 min. The NaBF4 dissolves as the mixture emulsifies and cools to 14\u00b0C (Note 3). After the mixture warms back to ambient temperature, 30 mL of CH2Cl2 is added and the contents are transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel. The bottom CH2Cl2 phase is separated (Note 4). The aqueous phase is extracted with an additional 20 mL of CH2Cl2. The combined CH2Cl2 phases are shaken in a separatory funnel with a solution of NaBF4 (10.0 g, 91 mmol) in 20 mL of water. The CH2Cl2 phase is separated and dried over a mixture of 1.0 g of Na2SO4 and 3.0 g of MgSO4. The mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel and the salts are washed with an additional 15 mL of CH2Cl2. A short path distillation head is attached to the 250 mL round-bottom-flask containing the filtrate and most of the CH2Cl2 is removed by distillation at 30 mm pressure. Care is taken not to heat the product above 50\u00b0C. The solvent is condensed in a receiver flask cooled in an ice-water slurry (Note 5). The last traces of CH2Cl2 are removed using a rotary evaporator at 15 mm and 45 \u00b0C followed by vacuum drying at ambient temperature until the weight remains constant.

The stopcock is again placed on the flask, and the mixture is heated under reflux. At the initial stage, the solution contains a yellow supernatant and an undissolved orange solid of Ru3(CO)12. The color of the solution gradually turns to red and all of the solid materials are dissolved after 30 min (Note 4). After 36 h, a dark red solution and some red precipitates have formed. The mixture is cooled to room temperature under an argon atmosphere. From this stage, subsequent work can be performed in the air. The precipitates are collected on a glass filter, washed with n-hexane (30 mL), and dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 5).

At this point, the initial dark-orange color of the catalyst solution changed to light orange. N,N-Dimethyl-3-phenylpropionamide (2) (10 mL, 56 mmol) (Note 17) is added drop wise over a period of 75 min via syringe (Note 18). Caution! The reaction is exothermic (Note 19). The solution is stirred for an additional 75 min, resulting in consumption of the amide as determined by TLC analysis (Note 20). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporator at room temperature (70 Torr) and the residue is poured into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing conc. HCl (84 mL, 12 M) at 0 \u00b0C. The reaction flask is rinsed with ether (3 \u00d7 84 mL), and the liquid is added to the Erlenmeyer flask. The mixture is moved to a separatory funnel and shaken well. The resulting aqueous solution is washed three times with 84 mL of ether (totally 252 mL). All ether layers are discarded and the aqueous phase is moved to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, cooled in an ice bath, and basified with KOH pellets (84 g) with stirring to form white solids. Ether (164 mL) is added to the mixture, stirred for 20 min, and the organic layer is separated. This ether extraction is repeated four times (84 mL each) (Note 21). The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature (50 Torr). Distillation of the crude product at 57 \u00b0C (2.1 Torr) gives N,N-dimethyl-3-phenylpropylamine (3) as a colorless oil (Note 22, 23) (8.32 g, 91%)."

This reaction generates hydrogen (H2) gas and therefore should be conducted in an efficient hood.\nA 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper, a Teflon-coated thermocouple, and a Leibig reflux condenser fitted with an inert gas inlet tube that is attached to a nitrogen manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, (0.2 mmHg) flushed with nitrogen, cooled to room temperature, and maintained under a slightly positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is charged with InCl3 (0.775 g, 3.5 mmol) (Note 1), which is then dried by heating the bottom of the flask with a hot air gun under vacuum (0.2 mmHg) for 2 min (Note 2). The flask is then refilled with nitrogen and kept under a slightly positive pressure. The glass stopper is removed and to the flask are added benzil (14.7 g, 70 mmol) (Note 3), dichloromethane (140 mL) (by syringe) (Note 4), and ethyl 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoate (by syringe) (13.6 g, 70 mmol) (Note 5). Chlorodimethylsilane (HSiMe2Cl) (7.28 g, 77 mmol) is added to the resulting mixture by syringe through an open neck while stirring (Note 6). The stopper is replaced and gentle evolution of gas (H2) starts in a few minutes (Note 7). The extent of the gas evolution gradually increases and the reaction temperature slowly increases (Note 8).\nAfter 35 min, gas evolution ceases (Note 9), indicating the end of the reaction. The solution is stirred for 5 min further (40 min total after addition of chlorodimethylsilane), whereupon water (100 mL) is added to the flask and the mixture is transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel containing diethyl ether (200 mL). After the mixture is shaken, the organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (1 \u00d7 100 mL, 1 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic extracts (yellow solution) are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated at reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C/14 mmHg). The residue is diluted with hexane (20 mL) and cooled in an ice-bath to give a precipitate, which is filtered (Note 10). The filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C/14 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil.\nThe oil is loaded onto a column (4 cm diam \u00d7 14 cm height) of 100 g of silica gel (Note 11) with hexane. Using compressed air, the column is eluted with hexane (250 mL) (Note 12) and then ethyl acetate (300 mL) (Note 13). The ethyl acetate fraction (yellow solution) is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C/14 mmHg) to afford 19.08 g of yellow liquid (Note 14). The liquid is distilled at reduced pressure to give 14.0 g (94%) of ethyl 3-chloro-3-phenylpropanoate (90 \u00b0C/0.2 mmHg) as a yellow oil (Notes 15-18)."

            "A 200-mL two-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1) connected to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold through a three-way stopcock is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a vacuum/nitrogen inlet, and a glass stopper. A microcrystalline sample of [60]fullerene (2.00 g, 2.78 mmol) (Note 2) is placed in the 200-mL flask and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. The glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (90 mL) (Note 3) is introduced into the flask via a syringe under nitrogen. The rubber septum is again replaced with a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is cooled with an ice/water bath and stirred under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Then the flask is flushed with nitrogen and warmed to room temperature (approximately 23 \u00b0C).\nA 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1), connected to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold through a three-way stopcock, is equipped with a 3-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a vacuum/nitrogen inlet, a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a glass stopper, and a glass stopper. The flask is charged with copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (6.84 g, 33.3 mmol) (Note 4) and flushed with nitrogen (Note 5). The glass stopper on the top of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is replaced with a rubber septum, and the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of [60]fullerene is transferred to the dropping funnel via a Teflon cannula. The glass stopper on the 500-mL flask is replaced with a rubber septum and tetrahydrofuran (47 mL) (Note 6) is added to the copper complex via syringe. The resulting white suspension is stirred and the flask is placed into an oil bath (approximately 23 \u00b0C). A tetrahydrofuran solution of methylmagnesium bromide (3 M, 11.1 mL, 33.3 mmol) (Note 7) is added to this white suspension by syringe, followed by 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI, 3.62 mL, 33.3 mmol) (Note 8). The organocopper reagent is quickly warmed in an oil bath to 35 \u00b0C within 5 min. The 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of [60]fullerene in the dropping funnel is added at once to the organocopper reagent (Note 9). The color of the suspension changes to dark brown. The dropping funnel is replaced with a glass stopper.\nAfter stirring for 40 min at 35 \u00b0C (Note 10), 3.0 mL of degassed saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added quickly via syringe. The color of the mixture turns from dark brown to reddish brown. The septum is replaced with a glass stopper and the reaction mixture is stirred under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) at 23 \u00b0C to remove tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfide until the volume is halved.\nThe concentrated mixture is diluted with degassed toluene (200 mL) and filtered through a pad of silica gel (Note 11) with toluene as eluent (Notes 12 and 13). The vermilion filtrate is collected into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (10 mmHg) at 40 \u00b0C. To remove 1,2-dichlorobenzene the bath temperature is raised to 80 \u00b0C until solid just begins to appear on the inside wall of the flask (Note 14). Nitrogen is added while the vacuum is broken, and the flask is removed from the rotary evaporator. Degassed methanol is added gently against the inside wall of the flask (Note 15). As methanol mixes with the product, the solution becomes cloudy and a precipitate forms. The addition is continued until precipitation is complete. The total amount of methanol required is approximately 400 mL. The precipitate is collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel (Note 16) and washed with methanol (5 \u00d7 10 mL) and hexane (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 12 h at room temperature to obtain red microcrystals of the title compound (2.08 g, 2.61 mmol) in 94% overall yield and 91% purity (determined by HPLC analysis) (Note 17). The product can be used as is for further transformations, or it can be purified by preparative HPLC (Notes 18 and 19)."

After being stirred for 1 h, the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 3 h to generate 2,2-difluorovinylborane. This solution of 2,2-difluorovinylborane is cooled in an ice bath prior to addition of trimethylamine oxide (10.9 g, 145 mmol) (Note 6). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h, and then allowed to warm to room temperature.

The water condensers are equipped with gas inlets connected to a single nitrogen source leading to an oil bubbler. The flask is placed in a Rayonet Photoreactor fitted with 14 \u00d7 8 Watt low pressure Hg lamps (254 nm). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with a heating mantle. The lamps are turned on, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 7 days. After the lamps are turned off, the system is allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 2). The liquid is then carefully decanted to a distillation flask and the mercury is recovered. Unreacted pyrrolidine and side products are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure (Note 3). The residue is distilled to provide 67.6 g (50%) of a mixture of (R\u2217,R\u2217) and (R\u2217,S\u2217)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear, light yellow liquid (bp 79\u201381 \u00b0C at 3.0 mmHg) (Note 4). The product is of sufficient purity to be used in the resolution step (Note 5).",
            "B. Resolution of 2,2'-Bispyrrolidine3,4\n1. Preparation of (R,R)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine\u00b7(L)-Tartrate To a solution of a 1/1 mixture of d,l- and meso-2,2'-bispyrrolidine (67.0 g, 479 mmol) in H2O (240 mL) is added (L)-(+)-tartaric acid (36.0 g, 240 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and acetic acid (27.4 mL, 479 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6). The mixture is heated to 90 \u00b0C and the homogenous solution is allowed to cool to room temperature slowly before it is placed in an ice bath. After the solid precipitates (Note 7), the mixture is kept in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is then filtered and is washed with ice-cold water (20 mL). The mother liquor is saved for the recovery of the (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine. The collected solid is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h to give 31.6 g of a light yellow powder. This solid is dissolved in hot water (90 mL) and the solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature before it is placed in an ice bath for 1 h. The precipitate is filtered and the solid is washed with ice-cold water (10 mL). The solid is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h to give 23.0 g of white crystals. This recrystallization process is repeated using water (50 mL) to give 21.4 g (62% based on isomer content) of (R,R)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine\u00b7(L)-tartrate as white prismatic crystals (Note 8).\n2. Preparation of (R,R)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine To a mixture of the tartrate salt (9.1 g) in water (15 mL) at 0 \u00b0C are added KOH (20 g) pellets (Note 9). The mixture is then stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min before diethyl ether (80 mL) is added, whereupon the solution is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for another 30 min. The aqueous layer is then separated and extracted with diethyl ether (6 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 10). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3) and then are concentrated under vacuum (Note 11). The residue is transferred to a dry 25-mL, round-bottomed flask. To this is added a small piece of sodium (Note 12) and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 30 min. The residue is distilled under vacuum to give 3.61 g (83%) of (R,R)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear colorless oil (bp 97\u201398 \u00b0C at 8.0 mmHg) (Note 13). The enantiomeric purity of product is determined by CSP-SFC and CSP-HPLC analysis of the corresponding dibenzoyl amide derivative (Note 14).\n3. Preparation of (S,S)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine\u00b7(D)-Tartrate The mother liquor from initial resolution is cooled to 0 \u00b0C and KOH pellets (80 g) are added slowly. The mixture is stirred vigorously at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min (Note 15). To this solution is added diethyl ether (500 mL) and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min. The aqueous layer is separated and then is extracted with diethyl ether (4 \u00d7 500 mL). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3), and then are concentrated under vacuum to give 48.4 g of a yellow oil. The oil is dissolved in H2O (150 mL), then (D)-(\u2212)-tartaric acid (34.5 g, 230 mmol) and acetic acid (27.0 mL, 473 mmol) are added (Note 16). The mixture is heated to 90 \u00b0C and the homogenous solution is allowed to cool to room temperature slowly before it is cooled in an ice bath. After the solid precipitates, the mixture is kept in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is filtered and the solid is washed with ice-cold water (10 mL), and then is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h to give 23.5 g of a light-yellow powder. The solid is dissolved in hot water (60 mL) and the solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature before it is placed in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice-cold water, and dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h to give 20.16 g of white prismatic crystals. This recrystallization process is repeated using water (55 mL) to give 18.4 g (55% based on isomer content) of (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine\u00b7(D)-(\u2212)-tartrate as white prismatic crystals (Note 17).\n4. Preparation of (S,S)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine To a solution of the tartrate salt (9.3 g) in water (15 mL) at 0 \u00b0C are added KOH pellets (20 g). The mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min before diethyl ether (80 mL) is added, whereupon it is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for another 30 min. The aqueous layer is separated and then is extracted with diethyl ether (6 \u00d7 50 mL). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3) and then are concentrated in vacuo (Note 11). The residue is then transferred to a dry 25-mL, round-bottomed flask. To this is added a piece of sodium (Note 12) and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 30 min. The residue is then distilled under vacuum to give 3.51 g (80%) of (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear, colorless oil (bp 97\u201398 \u00b0C at 8.0 mmHg) (Note 18).

The resulting mixture is stirred vigorously (Note 1) at room temperature. After a short induction period, a slight exotherm is observed lasting for the first ~24 h, accompanied with the formation of a thick gel (Note 1), which slowly disappears on prolonged stirring. After stirring the suspension for a total of 69 h, the mixture is filtered in three separate batches and the filter cake is washed with CH2Cl2 until the filtrate is colorless (Note 5). The filtrate is transferred to a 5-L separatory funnel and shaken with 3.3 M HCl (500 mL). After 2 h (Note 6), the two layers are separated and the aqueous layer is transferred to a 2-L conical flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The stirred aqueous solution is basified to pH 9-10 by the careful, portionwise addition of aqueous 25% w/v ammonium hydroxide (~150 mL) over 1 h (Note 7), followed by stirring for an additional 2 h (Note 8).

In a graduated tube equipped with a three-way stopcock attached to a nitrogen inlet from a Schlenk line, 7 mL (ca. 86 mmol) of trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) (Note 4) is condensed at \u221278 \u00b0C by using a dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath. After the CF3I condenses, the three-way stopcock is closed and the top of the stopcock is fitted with a rubber septum. The condensed CF3I is added to the reaction mixture quickly through a cannula by warming the graduated tube with a water bath. After almost all of CF3I is transferred to the reaction vessel, 10 mL of THF is added to the graduated test-tube through the septum, and the THF is transferred to the reaction vessel through the cannula by briefly evacuating the reaction vessel through a hose to the Schlenk line. The reaction mixture is immersed in an ice-bath, and then diethylzinc in hexane solution (75 mL 1.0 M) (Note 5) is gradually added to the solution through the presser-equalizing dropping funnel over 2 h. During the addition, the temperature of the solution is kept below 5 \u00b0C by cooling with an ice bath. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min after removing the ice-bath, whereupon it is stirred at room temperature for 1 h (Note 6). The progress of the reaction is followed by thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis (Note 7), which confirms that the reaction is complete (Note 8). The resulting mixture is carefully poured into a mixture of 10% HCl (150 mL) and ice (about 50 g) in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (Note 9). The ice melts in a few minutes, then the mixture is extracted with Et2O (4 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (100 mL) and then are dried over MgSO4 (about 20 g). The MgSO4 is removed by filtration through a sintered glass-filter, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 30 mm Hg). The residue is purified by silica gel (Note 10) column chromatography (190 g, diameter = 50 mm, eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate, 30/1; 1.2 L) to remove small amounts of impurities and most of the black color. The product-containing portions are concentrated under reduced pressure, and are purified by reduced-pressure distillation using short path distillation apparatus (66\u201368 \u00b0C / 3 mmHg) to afford 7.610 g (72 %) of 4-phenyl-3- (trifluoromethyl)butan-2-one as a clear, colorless oil (Notes 10 and 11)."

After the reaction flask is cooled for 10 min, the mixture is stirred vigorously (Note 5) and 24 g of a 50% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (12.0 g, 0.30 mol in 12 mL of H2O) (Note 6) is added dropwise via a syringe in 10 min (Note 7). The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at bath temperature (approximately 0 \u00b0C) for 2 h and at room temperature for 22 h. The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice bath and quenched by injecting 6 M hydrochloric acid (30 mL) dropwise over a 10 min period (Note 8). The hydrolysate is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, and the flask is rinsed with water (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and dichloromethane (30 mL), which is also added to the funnel. After addition of more water (60 mL) to the funnel, the mixture is shaken and the organic layer is separated from the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 60 mL) (Note 9). The combined organic extracts are dried with approximately 2 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) (Note 10), vacuum filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C at 70 mmHg) to afford a pale yellow residue. This residue is transferred to a 50-mL round bottom flask using approximately 2 mL of dichloromethane (Note 11). The dichloromethane is removed at 30\u201335 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature) at 50 mmHg, and the product is distilled at 65\u201370 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature) at 30 mmHg to give 12.94 g (84%) (Note 12) of 1,1-dichloro-2-ethoxycyclopropane (Note 13) as a colorless liquid, bp 55 \u00b0C/30 mmHg.",

The resulting mixture is stirred at a moderate speed at reflux for 48 h in an oil bath at 95 \u00b0C (bath temperature), and is then allowed to cool to room temperature before being concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C at 70 mmHg vacuum) until the volume is approximately 20 mL (Note 18). The residue is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel, and the flask is rinsed with water (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and dichloromethane (60 mL), which are also added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is shaken, and the organic layer is separated from the aqueous layer. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 50 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with a 0.7 M aqueous solution (2 \u00d7 100 mL) of copper sulfate (CuSO4) (Note 19), and dried with approximately 2 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 10). The organic phase is then vacuum filtered into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask through a plug of aluminum oxide (Note 20). Dichloromethane (15 mL) is added to the flask containing the MgSO4 and after mixing the contents for approximately 1 min, the dichloromethane solution is filtered through the plug as well. The combined filtrates are then concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C at 70 mmHg) and transferred with approximately 2 mL of dichloromethane to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask for vacuum distillation (Notes 11, 21). The dichloromethane is removed at 21 \u00b0C and 30 mmHg. Following the removal of the dichloromethane, the apparatus is placed again under vacuum (30 mmHg) and the 25-mL receiving flask is submerged in an acetone/dry ice bath. The product is distilled with an oil bath temperature of 80\u201385 \u00b0C. Upon completion of the distillation, nitrogen gas is bled into the apparatus from the vacuum adaptor as the vacuum is released. The receiving flask is warmed to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere before being removed. The distillation yields 6.75 g (59 %) of a clear liquid, bp 70\u201371 \u00b0C/30 mmHg (Note 22). The product, 2-chloro-3,3-diethoxyprop-1-ene (Note 23), is found by GC analysis to be 96.0\u201397.2% pure (Notes 24, 25, 26)."

An aqueous solution of 1 M lithium hydroxide (75 mL, 75 mmol, 5.1 equiv.) is added (Note 11), causing the color of the suspension to change from yellow to terracotta. The mixture is heated to 70 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature) and stirring is maintained at this temperature for 4 h to give an orange solution. The solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator until the volume remaining is about 75 mL. A small amount of precipitate is observed. The solution is acidified with 1 M hydrochloric acid (100 mL) to give a white precipitate with some slight foam. The solid is filtered slowly under vacuum on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 12) and washed sequentially with water (200 mL), methanol (100 mL) and diethyl ether (100 mL). Finally, the solid is dried overnight in a high vacuum oven (40 \u00b0C, approx. 0.02 mmHg) to afford the crude diacid 4 (3.8 g, 91%) (Notes 13, 14). The material is carried forward without further purification.",

In a 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a reflux condenser and an internal thermometer, dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]thiophene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid 4 (3.80 g, 13.4 mmol) and copper powder (0.81 g, 12.7 mmol, 0.95 equiv) (Note 15) are suspended in quinoline (25 mL). The mixture is heated to reflux at 230 \u00b0C for 1 h using a heating mantle. Petroleum ether (40\u201360) is added to the cooled reaction mixture and the organic layer is decanted into a 500-mL separatory funnel (Note 16). This process is repeated several times until the volume of the organic layer is about 150 mL. The organic phase is washed with 2 M hydrochloric acid (3 \u00d7 70 mL) and brine (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The organic layer is then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered through a fluted filter paper and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to give a pale yellow oil. The residue is dissolved in a small amount of dichloromethane and filtered through a short (about 8 cm length \u00d7 5.5 cm diameter) column of silica (Note 17), using petroleum ether (40-60) as eluent. The eluent is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a white crystalline solid. The solid is recrystallized by dissolving in 2 mL of dichloromethane at 30 \u00b0C, adding methanol dropwise at a rate of one drop every 5 seconds to the solution until it becomes cloudy (about 5 mL), adding another drop of dichloromethane to remove the cloudiness and allowing the solution to cool to ambient temperature for 30 min. The resulting crystals are collected under vacuum on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with ice-cold methanol (10 mL), dried in the funnel under vacuum and transferred to an appropriate vial to be further dried in a vacuum dessicator (25 mmHg, overnight, silica gel dessicant with moisture indicator) to give the purified dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]thiophene 5 (1.9 g, 72%) (Note 18)."

The combined organic extracts are washed with 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (120 mL) and set aside. The combined aqueous extracts (pH 9) are acidified with 6 M HCl (100 mL) to pH 1. The resulting cloudy suspension is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 120 mL). These organic extracts are combined, washed with brine (120 mL), dried over MgSO4 (4 g), filtered through a coarse glass frit and then are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) to yield 7.64 g of a viscous yellow-orange oil that solidifies upon standing in the freezer (\u221220 \u00b0C) (Note 17).

            "A. 2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranose. A dry, 2000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (41 \u00d7 19 mm) and an ice-salt bath, and at the respective necks with a thermometer, a septum, and a rubber stopper. A nitrogen atmosphere is incorporated by a needle inserted through the septum. The stopper is temporarily removed, replaced with a funnel and acetic anhydride (900 mL, 9.52 mol, Note 1) is added from a bottle that had been stored in a refrigerator at 5 \u00b0C. The stopper is replaced and the acetic anhydride is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with stirring, the stopper is again replaced by a funnel, and then 80.0 g (362 mmol) of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 270 g of montmorillonite K-10 (Note 1) are sequentially added over a 10-min period such that the internal temperature does not rise above ambient. The stopper is replaced, the ice bath is removed, and the suspension is stirred for 24 h.\nThe reaction mixture is filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (600 mL capacity) pre-coated with a pad of 20 g of Celite moistened with methyl acetate (Note 1). The flask and filtered solids are washed with methyl acetate, about 1 L total, and then the combined filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 5 mmHg). The resulting orange residue is dislodged with a spatula, and then dissolved in 200 mL of hot methanol. The methanolic solution is placed in a 5 \u00b0C explosion proof refrigerator and a precipitate forms over 24 h. The solid is collected by filtration and washed with 100 mL of diethyl ether, then dried (23 \u00b0C, 1 mm) to afford 46.3 g (33%) of product as a white solid (mp 179\u2013180 \u00b0C) (Notes 2 and 3).",
            "B. GlcNAc-thiazoline triacetate. A 1000-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere immersed in an oil bath is fitted with Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (41 \u00d7 19 mm), a rubber septum and a reflux condenser capped with a septum, through which nitrogen is affixed by use of a needle. The septum on the flask is temporarily removed, a funnel inserted and the vessel is charged with 300 mL of isopropyl acetate and 18.3 g (40 mmol) of phosphorus pentasulfide (P4S10). The resulting suspension is stirred rapidly while 76.3 mL (360 mmol) of hexamethyldisiloxane (Note 4) is added via syringe over a 5-min period. The mixture is heated at reflux for 10 min while vigorous stirring is maintained. The solution is allowed to cool to just below reflux, the septum on the flask is replaced with a funnel and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranose (40.0 g, 103 mmol) is added in four portions with continuous stirring over a 5-min period. The septum is replaced and the reaction mixture is then brought back to reflux, and held at that temperature for 2\u20133 h, during which period it becomes homogeneous and orange. TLC analysis (3:1, dichloromethane / ethyl acetate) indicates complete conversion to product (Rf = 0.40 on silica).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stirred for an additional 12 h (Note 5). The septum is removed and acetone (150 mL) is added. The flask is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-salt bath (Note 6), and then 52 mL of 5.3 M aqueous K2CO3 is added. The quenched reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 30 min, then water and isopropyl acetate are used to transfer the reaction mixture to a 2-L separatory funnel (total 300 mL of water and 200 mL of isopropyl acetate). The organic layer is separated and washed with 0.53 M aqueous K2CO3 (3 \u00d7 200 mL or until the aqueous layer is colorless), and then dried over 30 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration followed by concentration on the rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 5 mmHg) gives an orange oil, which is mixed with 50 mL of isopropyl acetate and 55 g of silica, and then concentrated to give an orange powder. A plug of 170 g of silica moistened with isopropyl acetate is layered onto a coarse porosity sintered glass funnel (600 mL capacity). The orange powder is placed on the silica plug and tamped with a piece of filter paper, which is left in place. A mixture of heptanes / isopropyl acetate (70:30, 1.25 L, then 40:60, 125 mL) is used to wash through high Rf impurities, which are discarded as waste. Elution with 1.5 L of 40:60 heptanes / isopropyl acetate is followed by pure isopropyl acetate (~1 L) until the product is washed off the silica according to TLC analysis. Concentration of this latter solution on the rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 5 mmHg) followed by a high vacuum (27 \u00b0C, 0.05 mmHg), until a constant weight is obtained, provides 31.1 g (88%) of GlcNAc-thiazoline triacetate as an orange oil (Note 7)."

The resulting yellow mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min and then a mixture of 1-octyne (14.75 mL, 11.02 g, 100.0 mmol) (Note 6) and n-butylamine (14.82 mL, 10.97 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 7) is transferred into the reaction mixture via cannula over 5 min from a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a septum and an argon inlet needle. The flask is rinsed with two 3-mL portions of toluene, which are transferred into the pressure flask by cannula. The septum is temporarily removed from the pressure flask and copper(I) iodide (0.571 g, 2.99 mmol, 0.03 equiv) (Note 8) is added in one portion. Material adhering to the sides of the pressure flask is rinsed into the reaction mixture with 5 mL of toluene. The pressure flask is then sealed under argon with a threaded Teflon cap and submerged in a preheated oil bath at 40 \u00b0C behind a safety shield. (Note 9) The color of the clear yellow solution darkens to red over 4 h. After 8 h (Note 10), the cloudy red mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then filtered through a medium frit sintered glass funnel to remove the precipitated ammonium salt. The solid is washed with 100 mL of hexanes, and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The resulting red oil (28.0 g) is diluted with 20 mL of CH2Cl2 and concentrated onto 40 g of silica gel (40 \u00b0C, 16 mmHg, Note11). The clumpy powder is transferred to a column (25 \u00d7 8 cm) of 600 g of silica gel (Note 11) and is eluted with hexanes. After elution with 1000 mL of hexanes, 50-mL fractions are collected.

The solution of enynyl chloride is transferred via cannula into the solution of LDA at such a rate so as to maintain the internal temperature between \u221270 and \u221278 \u00b0C (Notes 17, 18). The 250-mL flask is washed with two 5-mL portions of THF and the washings are transferred by cannula to the flask containing the LDA.

            "A. Chloromethyl methyl ether as a solution in toluene. A three-necked 500-mL flask is fitted with a magnetic stirbar, thermometer, reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and addition funnel (Note 1). The vessel is charged with dimethoxymethane (22.1 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2), toluene (66 mL, 3 volumes) (Notes 3, 4) and ZnBr2 (5.6 mg, 0.01 mol%) (Notes 5, 6). The zinc bromide dissolves shortly after addition. Acetyl chloride (17.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 7) is placed in the addition funnel and then introduced into the reaction mixture at a constant rate over 5\u201315 minutes (Note 8). The addition funnel is rinsed with a minimum volume of toluene (5 mL) directly into the reaction mixture. The reaction self-heats slowly to 40\u201345 \u00b0C and then cools to ambient temperature over 2\u20133 h, at which time the exchange reaction is typically complete (Note 9). This clear, colorless solution of chloromethyl methyl ether in toluene is employed directly in the subsequent step without further manipulation (Note 10).",
            "B. 1-Methoxymethyl-1-phenylethane. The reaction flask containing a toluene solution of chloromethyl methyl ether (250 mmol, 1.5 equiv) prepared above is immersed in a cold water bath and the contents cooled to 5\u201310 \u00b0C. \u03b1-Phenethyl alcohol (20 mL, 166 mmol, 1 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added in one portion (Note 11). Diisopropylethylamine (36.0 mL, 208 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added to the reaction mixture dropwise over 30 min (Notes 12, 13). The internal temperature of the mixture is maintained below 25 \u00b0C during and immediately after the amine addition, and once heat evolution has ceased, the reaction mixture is allowed to come to ambient temperature and then stirred for 12 h. At this time the starting material is consumed (Note 14). The orange solution is diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (100 mL), and the biphasic mixture stirred vigorously for a minimum of five minutes to ensure all residual chloromethyl methyl ether is decomposed (Note 15). The layers are separated and the resulting clear, colorless organic layer is washed once with water (100 mL), once with brine (100 mL), dried with MgSO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation to a clear, colorless oil (Note 16). The material is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a short-path distillation head. The product is purified by distillation, collecting a single fraction (bp 60\u201363 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg) of 1-methoxymethoxy-1-phenylethane as a clear, colorless oil (26.2 g, 157 mmol, 95% yield) (Notes 17, 18, 19)."

A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is sequentially charged with diyne substituted carbazole 3 (19.5 g, 0.035 mol), THF (100 mL) and ethanol (400 mL). As the resulting solution is stirred, a solution of NaOH (4.21 g, 0.11 mol) in H2O (30 mL) is added slowly over 5 min. The solution is stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for an additional 2 h during which time the solution changes from orange to red. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (water bath temperature 45\u201350 \u00b0C) to afford a residue, which is partitioned between CH2Cl2 (450 mL) and H2O (100 mL) in a 1-L separatory funnel. The separated organic layer is washed with H2O (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and brine (2 \u00d7 100 mL), and then is dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (20\u201325 mmHg, water bath temperature 30\u201335 \u00b0C). Diyne-substituted carbazole 4 is obtained as a yellow-red oil that becomes a tan solid upon standing (14.0 g, 97%) and is used without further purification (Notes 11, 12).",

Then, a reflux condenser equipped with a bubbler filled with oil is placed on the three-necked flask and one of the side necks is stoppered. Subsequently, a nitrogen inlet is connected to the remaining neck and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min. Next, under a low flow of nitrogen, the stoppered side neck is opened and the catalyst solution is added through a funnel using 200 mL of toluene (Note 3) to rinse the flask. Under magnetic stirring the resulting mixture is flushed with nitrogen for 10 min. Then, the nitrogen inlet is removed, the neck stoppered and the 1000 mL, three-necked flask placed in a preheated oil bath at 130 \u00b0C for 20 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 7). Vigorous magnetic stirring is required to prevent precipitation of the base (Note 8). When the reaction mixture is cooled down to room temperature, it is filtered over a sintered glass filter funnel containing Celite\u00ae (Note 9) using 1000 mL of EtOAc (Note 10).

Pure dichloromethane (Note 11) is used as an eluent until the product begins to elute and subsequently, 99:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH is used to afford ethyl 4-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)amino]benzoate (7.068 g combined from two purifications, 25.5 mmol, 85%) (Notes 16\u201320) as a light beige solid."

An oven-dried, 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a stopcock and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is cooled to room temperature under a flow of nitrogen. While temporarily removing the septum, the flask is charged with gold(III) chloride (AuCl3) (0.303 g, 1 mmol, 5 mol% Au) and silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf) (0.77 g, 3 mmol, 15 mol%) (Note 1) under N2. Dichloromethane (150 mL) (Note 2) is added, and the catalyst mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5\u20132 h, resulting in a brown suspension (Note 3). Dibenzoylmethane (4.48 g, 20 mmol) (Note 4) is added to the reaction flask over 2 min while temporarily removing the septum and the color of the reaction mixture turns green. Styrene (3.45 mL, 30 mmol) (Notes 5, 6) is diluted to 25 mL with CH2Cl2 and added dropwise to the reaction mixture by syringe pump through the septum over 6\u20137 h at room temperature (Note 7). The mixture is then stirred for another 30 min (Note 8). A deep-green solution is obtained (Note 9). The solution is filtered through approximately 40 mL of silica gel in a 60-mL glass B\u00fcchner filter funnel to remove the catalyst (Note 10). The silica gel is washed with ether (6 \u00d7 50 mL), and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at room temperature. The residue, a clear, orange-brown oil, is then purified by flash column chromatography (Note 11) to provide the crude product as a pale yellow solid (6.44 g, 98 %) (Note 12). Further purification is achieved by recrystallization. The crude product is dissolved in 30 mL of hot EtOAc, and diluted with 90 mL of hexanes to the point of cloudiness. The mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature overnight, and the resulting solids are collected by filtration, rinsing with 10 mL of hexanes. The solids are air-dried, then placed in a vacuum oven for 4 h to provide analytically pure product as a white solid (4.16 g, 12.7 mmol, 63%) (Notes 13, 14)."

            "A. Bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-phosphine oxide (2). To an oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir-bar, and fitted with a graduated 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (fitted with a septum) in the center neck, a thermocouple inserted through a rubber septum in the left neck, and an inert gas inlet valve in the right neck, is evacuated (0.03 mmHg vacuum) and backfilled three times with argon. The flask is charged with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene 1 (59.2 mL, 343 mmol, 3.3 equiv, Note 1) followed by anhydrous THF (60 mL, Note 2) through the addition funnel septum cap with a syringe. The addition funnel is then charged with isopropylmagnesium chloride (171.5 mL, 343 mmol, 3.3 equiv, 2.0 M solution in THF, Note 3) via cannula under argon pressure. The flask is then placed in a dry-ice/acetone bath. When the internal temperature reaches \u201330 \u00b0C, the solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride is added rapidly over 10 min. The internal temperature at the conclusion of the addition is \u221260 \u00b0C. Tetrahydrofuran (10 mL, added through the addition funnel septum cap with a syringe) is used to wash the walls of the addition funnel into the flask. The dry-ice/acetone bath is then replaced by an ice/H2O bath. The internal temperature rapidly rises to a maximum of 9 \u00b0C in approximately 5 min, to give a clear, brown solution, then the internal temperature rapidly falls to 2 \u00b0C (Note 4). At this time a 50 \u03bcL aliquot is removed by syringe through the septum in the left neck of the flask, and is quenched into a biphasic mixture of Et2O/2 M HCl (~ 2 mL). The aqueous layer is removed and the organic solution is back extracted with H2O (1 mL). The organic layer is filtered through a SiO2 plug (1 mm \u00d7 2 cm), which is eluted with Et2O (~2 mL). The filtrate is analyzed by gas chromatography to monitor reaction progress (Notes 5 and 6). An additional portion of isopropylmagnesium chloride solution (5 mL, 10 mmol, 3% of the original Grignard charge) is added at once by syringe at 1 \u00b0C through the septum in the left neck of the flask. After an additional 0.5 h, GC analysis of a quenched aliquot indicates that Grignard exchange is complete (total reaction time 1 h after the initial exotherm).\nThe addition funnel is then charged with THF (30 mL) followed by diethyl phosphite (13.7 mL, 104 mmol, 1 equiv, Note 7) through the septum cap with a syringe. The reaction solution is again cooled in a dry-ice/acetone bath. When the internal temperature reaches \u201360 \u00b0C, the phosphite solution is added drop-wise over 10 min, causing the internal temperature to rise to \u201350 \u00b0C. The cold bath is removed, and the reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature (~18\u201320 \u00b0C). After one hour at ambient temperature, GC analysis of a quenched aliquot indicates the reaction is complete to give phosphine oxide 2 (tR = 6.90 min, GC Method 2). The reaction mixture is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C internal temperature in an ice/H2O bath, and 3 N HCl (175 mL) is added by addition funnel over 15 min. The addition funnel is removed and saturated aqueous NaCl solution (150 mL) is then added at once. Then EtOAc (250 mL) is added and the biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is back-extracted with EtOAc (250 mL). The combined organic extracts are then dried (MgSO4, 50 g, Note 8), filtered into a 1-L round-bottomed flask and the solvent is removed with rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue is further dried under high vacuum (0.02 mmHg, 15 min) to remove the 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene by-product (Note 9). The resulting orange-brown solid is dissolved in boiling MTBE (90 \u2013 110 mL) in a 1-L round-bottomed flask, equipped a magnetic stir-bar, and a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with an argon adaptor at the top. The contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature under argon, with stirring, causing a thick, brown slurry to form (Note 10). Hexanes (140 mL) are added over 10 min to this slurry through the addition funnel (Note 11). The mixture is then stirred for an additional 10 min to break up any large solids, and the mixture is filtered through a medium-fritted filter funnel, washing the flask and filter cake with MTBE (5 mL). The solid is dried under a vigorous stream of argon, from an inverted funnel, flowing over the filter cake. After 2 h, compound 2 (36.0\u201337.1 g, 73\u201375%) is obtained as a powdery, white solid (Note 12).",
            "B. Bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine (3). A 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stir-bar is fitted with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (fitted with a rubber septum) in the center neck, a thermocouple through a rubber septum in the left neck, and an inert gas valve in the right neck. Phosphine oxide 2 (10.0 g, 21.0 mmol, 1 equiv) is added under a flow of argon by removal of the inert gas valve. After replacement of the inert gas valve, MTBE (50 mL, Note 13) is added via syringe to the flask through the septum on the addition funnel. The resulting slurry is stirred under argon at ambient temperature for 5 min. The addition funnel is then charged with DIBAL-H (42.2 mL, 42.2 mmol, 1.0 M solution in cyclohexane, 2 equiv, Note 14). This solution is then added drop-wise to the substrate slurry over 10 min. The internal temperature rises to a maximum temperature of 36 \u00b0C and a brown solution forms (Fig. 1). The addition funnel is rinsed with MTBE (5 mL). The resulting mixture is then stirred for 1 h, and then is placed in a dry-ice/acetone bath. A needle connected to an argon source is inserted through the flask septum and positioned beneath the solution surface, so that a slow stream of argon is bubbled through the solution (Note 15). The addition funnel is charged with an aqueous 2 N NaOH solution (80 mL). This solution is added drop-wise to the reaction mixture over ~ 15 min. The internal temperature rises to \u201327 \u00b0C during the addition (Note 16). The cold bath is replaced by a water bath (30\u201335 \u00b0C) to raise the internal temperature to approximately 20 \u00b0C, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min at this temperature (Note 17). Stirring is stopped, and two clear phases are observed (See Fig. 2). A 32-cm, 18-gauge needle attached to a 60-mL polyethylene syringe is inserted through the flask septum with the needle tip pressed against the bottom of the flask. The lower (aqueous) phase is removed by syringe and discarded as waste. The addition funnel is charged with H2O (40 mL) by syringe through the addition funnel septum cap and added to the reaction flask by slow addition over approximately 5 min. The mixture is stirred for 5 min, then the lower (aqueous) phase is removed by syringe through flask septum and discarded as waste, leaving the solution of crude secondary phosphine 3 in the reaction flask.\nAn Airfree filter is charged with Merck silica gel 60 (32 g) followed by anhydrous MgSO4 (28 g), and topped with sand (30 g) (Note 18, see Fig. 1). The filter is then sealed with a rubber septum that is further secured with a piece of copper wire. The bottom of the Airfree filter is connected to a vacuum take-off adapter (Note 19), which in turn is connected to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask used as receiver. The side arm of the vacuum take-off adapter is connected with a short piece of rubber tubing to a Florence flask cold trap (Note 20) that is cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C in a dry-ice/acetone bath to collect the evaporated organic solvents. The cold trap is vented to an argon bubbler. All joints of the Airfree filter apparatus are greased with Dow silicon grease (Note 21). A mixture of cyclohexane/MTBE (5:1, 100 mL) is then injected by syringe through the septum cap of the Airfree funnel containing the silica gel/MgSO4 column. A slight argon pressure is applied from the upper valve of the Airfree filter, and the solvent is passed through to wet the solids. The receiver flask is removed and the wash solvent discarded as waste. A new, oven-dried, 500-mL one-necked receiver flask is then installed, and argon is purged gently through the system for approximately 5 min. The organic phase from the reaction flask containing the crude secondary phosphine is removed by syringe and injected through the septum cap of the Airfree filter onto the column (see Fig. 3). At the same time, a cyclohexane/MTBE mixture (5:1, 100 mL) is charged to the reaction flask by syringe (Notes 15, 22). A slight positive pressure of argon is applied to the upper valve of the Airfree filter as before, slowly flowing the secondary phosphine solution through the column. Then, 100 mL of the solvent mixture is injected through the septum cap of the Airfree filter and is passed through the solids under a slight argon pressure to wash the remaining column contents into the receiver flask. The entire product is now contained in the 500-mL receiver flask (Fig. 4, Note 23).\nThe receiver flask is placed in a warm water bath (32 \u2013 40 \u00b0C) (Note 24). The rate of argon flow through the Airfree filter side arm is then increased, causing the solvents to be removed from the secondary phosphine product by evaporation, with solvent condensation in the attached cold trap (Note 25). After approximately 8 h, all the solvent is removed and the product secondary phosphine 3 (7.7\u20137.8 g, 79\u201383% yield) is obtained as a white crystalline solid in the receiver (Fig. 5, Note 26).\nThe secondary phosphine can be recrystallized by working in a dry box. The solid is transferred to a one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir-bar, and a septum-sealed, Teflon-taped three-way adaptor. The flask is removed from the dry-box and the adaptor is attached to an argon inert gas line. A 20-gauge needle is inserted through the septum as a vent, then degassed MeOH (18 mL) is added via syringe. The contents are then magnetically stirred and heated with a heat gun until all the solids dissolved. The needle is removed and the flask is isolated from the septum by turning the three-way stopcock. The contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature. When the contents became turbid (Fig. 6), the flask is placed in an ice bath for 1 h. While still in the ice-bath, the mother-liquor is cannula-transferred to another septum-sealed, one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask that is purged three times with argon. The crystals remaining are washed with chilled (0 \u00b0C) degassed MeOH (5 mL) and the wash is transferred to the flask containing the mother liquor. The crystals are further dried under reduced pressure (0.03 mmHg) for 30 min and then are transferred to the dry-box for isolation (crop 1, 6.0\u20136.3 g, 61\u201364%). The flask containing the mother liquor is transferred to the dry-box and placed in a \u201320 \u00b0C freezer for 12 h. A second crop is collected by vacuum filtration in the dry box to give 0.90\u20130.36 g (combined crops 6.7\u20136.9 g, 68\u201370%) of 3 as colorless needles (Note 27)."

The residual sodium azide is rinsed into the round-bottomed flask with water (2 \u00d7 6 mL). The suspension is stirred for 20 min in the water bath and a mild exotherm occurs (Note 2). The solution is then brought to gentle reflux with a heating mantle for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent is removed carefully on the rotary evaporator (40 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C water bath), as the heterogeneous mixture has a tendency to bump. The residue is partitioned between Et2O (100 mL) and H2O (100 mL), transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous phase is further extracted with of Et2O (3 \u00d7 30 mL).

A 2-L three-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40 ground glass joints) is fitted with a drying tube, a 125-mL addition funnel, a magnetic stir bar (Note 3), and a septum through which is passed a metal temperature probe. To the flask is added 2-chloro-3-pyridine carboxaldehyde (20.0 g, 141 mmol) (Note 1), MeOH (200 mL), and methyl azidoacetate (32 mL, 349 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 4). A slightly positive pressure of nitrogen is placed on the system via a needle through the septum. The flask is placed in an acetone bath, and dry ice is added slowly to the bath until the internal temperature reaches \u221210 to \u221212 \u00b0C (Note 5). At that point, a 25% solution of NaOMe in MeOH (80 mL, 4.37 M, 349 mmol, 2.5 equiv) is slowly added using the addition funnel over a period of 25 to 30 min. Dry ice is occasionally added to the cold bath during this time to maintain the internal temperature at approximately \u22129 to \u221212 \u00b0C. The reaction color changes from clear pale brown to cloudy orange/yellow as the addition proceeds, and mild bubbling is noted. When the addition is completed, the mixture is stirred an additional 15 min at \u221210 \u00b0C. The flask is then transferred to an ice bath, and stirring is continued for 2.5 h, during which time the internal temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 \u00b0C (Note 6). A tan-colored precipitate gradually forms (product), and slow bubbling is observed. The reaction is then placed in an ice bath in a 4 \u00b0C cold room, and is stirred overnight (16 h) with the drying tube in place. The flask is covered in aluminum foil to exclude light. The next morning, a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask is placed in an ice bath and the flask is then charged with 500 g of ice and 1.5 L of saturated NH4Cl solution. A stir bar is transferred to the Erlenmeyer flask, and the tan-colored suspension is poured onto the stirring mixture over approximately 20 sec. The reaction flask is rinsed with 3 \u00d7 50 mL of ice water to ensure that any remaining solid is transferred. The final pH of the suspension is approximately 7.5. After stirring for an additional 5 min, the product is collected on a 12-cm B\u00fcchner funnel using a standard vacuum filtration setup, washing with ice-cold water (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 7). The tan-colored solid is air-dried for 10 min on the B\u00fcchner funnel under suction from an aspirator, and is then transferred to a 1-L single-necked round-bottomed flask and placed under high vacuum for 30 min. Dichloromethane (250 mL) is then added to dissolve the product, and MgSO4 (approximately 3\u20134 g) is added to dry the solution.

            "A. 1(S),2(S)-Diphenyl-N,N'-bis-[1(R)-phenyl-ethyl]-ethane-1,2-diamine (2). In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a N2 inlet, two septa and a magnetic stirring bar is introduced successively CH2Cl2 (180 mL) (Note 1) and an aqueous glyoxal solution (9.40 mL, 82.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) by syringe through one of the septa. One septum is temporarily removed and solid magnesium sulfate (40.0 g) (Note 3) is then added portion-wise over 20 min, while the mixture is stirred at room temperature. The resulting suspension is stirred for an additional 10 min, and then (R)-(+)-phenylethylamine (21.0 mL, 20.0 g, 165.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 4) is introduced dropwise via syringe over a 5 min period. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. Magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and rinsed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation and then further dried under high vacuum for 1 h (Note 5) to provide crude bis-imine (1) (Note 6) as an orange oil (21.3 g, 98.0%), which is used directly for the next step without further purification. Into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 7) equipped with one low temperature thermometer, one N2 inlet and one septum is introduced crude bis-imine 1 (21.3 g) as a solution in Et2O (300 mL) by syringe (Note 8). This solution is cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C (dry ice-acetone bath), and PhMgCl (162 mL, 2.0 M in THF, 325 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 9) is added drop-wise via syringe pump (Note 10) while maintaining the internal temperature between \u221278 \u00b0C and \u221275 \u00b0C over 2 h (Note 11). The resulting dark brown mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature gradually over 4 h, and stirred for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The mixture is then cooled to 4 \u00b0C (ice/water bath), and carefully quenched by the addition of a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (200 mL) after removal of the septum over 30 min. The solid that is formed is dissolved by the addition of de-ionized water (100 mL), and the two phases are separated in a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is then further extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (50.0 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (30 g, 5 min) and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation and further dried under high vacuum for 1 h. The crude product (33.5 g) is purified by flash column chromatography. Thus, the crude brown solid is dissolved in the minimum amount of CH2Cl2 (approximately 10 mL), charged on a column (8 \u00d7 16 cm) containing 400 g of silica gel (Note 12) and eluted with Et2O-petroleum ether (5:95, 2 L, then 10:90, 2 L). After the first apolar impurity (this spot is only evident by UV), the title compound elutes, before a mixture of other isomers (Note 13). The combined fractions of the major isomer are concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide a slightly yellow solid (16.8 g). This solid is dissolved in boiling petroleum ether (250 mL), with addition of a small amount of CH2Cl2 (5 mL) to complete the dissolution. The solvent is allowed to evaporate to 1/5 of the initial volume at room temperature over 2 days, allowing the crystallisation to occur (Note 14). These crystals are collected by filtration, and rinsed with a small amount (15.0 mL) of cold (0 \u00b0C) petroleum ether. Thus, 13.8\u201314.7 g (40\u201343%) of pure diamine 2 are obtained (Note 15).",
            "B. (3aS,7aR)-2-[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-ethyl]-hexahydro-isoindole-1,3-dione (3). Into a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a septum and a magnetic stirring bar, containing cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride (8.50 g, 55.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 16) is added glacial acetic acid (100 mL), followed by 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamine (10.1 g, 55.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 17). The septum is removed and the flask is equipped with a Liebig condenser. The reaction is then heated at reflux (oil bath temperature 120 \u00b0C) for 13 h. The resulting mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and poured into a 1-L beaker containing 400 mL of de-ionized water. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic phases are transferred into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, cooled to 4 \u00b0C (water/ice bath) and neutralized by the slow addition (30 min) of a saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (150 mL) under vigorous stirring. After the addition is finished, the two phases are separated and the organic phase is further washed with saturated aqueous Na2CO3 (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic phase is then dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (20.0 g, 5 min). After removal of the solid by filtration, the organic phase is concentrated by rotary evaporation and further dried under high vacuum for 1 h. The resulting yellow solid is recrystallized from boiling light petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (100 mL:25 mL). Crystallization is allowed to occur at room temperature over 2 h, then at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) petroleum ether (25 mL) to give 14.2 g (81%) (Note 18) of the title compound 3 (Note 19).",

The resulting pink solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (23 \u00b0C) by removing the cooling bath, and then stirred at this temperature for 30 min (Note 22). This solution is then cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C and transferred over 2 h via cannula into a 250-mL two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with one septum and one low temperature thermometer containing a solution of imide 3 (6.00 g, 18.9 mmol) in THF (80 mL) while maintaining the internal temperature at \u221278 \u00b0C. The resulting mixture is then stirred for 1 h at \u221278 \u00b0C. A solution of methyl cyanoformate (3.00 mL, 37.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 23) in THF (10 mL) is then added dropwise via cannula over 15 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for 1 h at \u221278 \u00b0C, then the cooling bath is removed, and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (80.0 mL) is added slowly, followed by de-ionized water (20 mL). The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (50 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (20.0 g, 5 min).

A single-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and connected by a three-way stopcock fitted with a rubber septum to a vacuum-argon manifold, is flame-dried under vacuum (0.3 mm Hg), then is flushed with dry argon. THF (90 mL) is added via syringe to the addition funnel, followed by trimethyl borate (10.0 mL, 89.2 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 1). After the addition of the trimethyl borate to the round-bottomed flask, additional THF (30 mL) (Note 1) is added via syringe to rinse the addition funnel. The solution is then cooled in a dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath. Phenethylmagnesium chloride (60.0 mL of a 1.0 M solution in THF, 60.0 mmol) (Note 2) is then added dropwise over 1 h via the addition funnel. The mixture is stirred in the dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath for 1.5 h, then is allowed to warm to room temperature over 1 h. The resulting white slurry is then cooled in an ice/water bath and methanol (60 mL) (Note 3) is charged into the addition funnel by syringe. The methanol is added over 15 min to dilute the slurry (Note 4). The argon inlet is removed and a solution of potassium hydrogen fluoride (80.0 mL of 4.5 M aqueous solution, 360 mmol, 6.0 equiv) (Note 5) is then charged into the addition funnel and is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred for 1 h in the ice/water bath, and then is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (60 \u00b0C water bath, 9 mm Hg). The resulting white solids are placed on a high-vacuum line (0.3 mm Hg) for 36 h until the solids appear dry (Note 6). Acetone (120 mL) (Note 7) is added and the solids are broken up into a fine powder with a spatula. The suspension is then placed on a rotary evaporator and heated (40 \u00b0C) with rotation under atmospheric pressure for 5\u201310 min and filtered over a 14 g pad of Celite in a glass-fritted filter funnel. Acetone (120 mL) is added to the solid remaining in the flask, the suspension is placed on a rotary evaporator and heated (40 \u00b0C) with rotation under atmospheric pressure for 5\u201310 min and filtered over the same Celite pad. This process is repeated one additional time (Note 8). The combined filtrates are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (60 \u00b0C water bath) to a white solid, which is dissolved in a minimal amount of dry acetone (~25 mL). Diethyl ether (30 mL) is then added to precipitate the product. The white slurry is allowed to cool first to 23 \u00b0C, and then is cooled in an ice/water bath for 15 min.

Xylenes (75 mL) (Note 3) are added and a water-cooled condenser is attached to the flask. Vigorous stirring is commenced and the solution is heated to reflux in an oil bath for 3 h during which time two layers form. The flask is then removed from the oil bath and the flask is fitted with a thermometer. When the solution has cooled to 60\u201370 \u00b0C, the thermometer is removed and acetonitrile (50 mL) (Note 4) is slowly added with vigorous stirring and scraping using a metal spatula to prevent the product from sticking to the sides of the flask (Note 5). The product, which is eventually converted to a white solid, is collected by vacuum filtration in a B\u00fcchner funnel. The product is washed with diethyl ether (300 mL) (Note 6) and then dried under vacuum (0.05 mmHg) for 2 h to afford 46.6\u201346.7g (84%) of pure 2-carboxyethyltriphenylphosphonium chloride as a white solid (Note 7).",

A 500-mL, 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar is fitted with an argon inlet adaptor, a 100-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel and a reflux condenser. The tops of the addition funnel and reflux condenser are sealed with septa, the apparatus is flame dried under vacuum (0.05 mmHg) and then is backfilled with argon. Magnesium turnings (3.65 g, 150 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 8) are then added and the flask is evacuated and filled with argon twice. Dry diethyl ether (100 mL) (Note 9) is added through the condenser via cannula. Iodomethane (9.98 mL, 22.7 g, 160 mmol, 1.60 equiv) (Note 10) is then added by syringe to the addition funnel. Stirring is commenced and the iodomethane is added dropwise to the magnesium turnings at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux (13\u201317 min is required to complete the addition). The solution is then stirred for another 20 min after the addition is complete. A solution of \u03b1-tetralone (14.6 g, 100 mmol) (Note 11) in dry diethyl ether (10 mL) is transferred via syringe from a flame-dried 100-mL round bottom flask to the addition funnel and then added dropwise to the methyl magnesium iodide solution at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux (12\u201316 min is required for the addition). The solution is stirred for another 15 min after completion of the addition. The rubber septa are then removed from the tops of both the condenser and the addition funnel. An aqueous solution of 3 N HCl (60 mL) is placed in the addition funnel and then is added dropwise to the solution over 30 min. The mixture is then vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature, after which time the mixture is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 30 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, vacuum filtered through a plug of silica gel (24 g) in a B\u00fcchner funnel and then concentrated by rotary evaporation at room temperature. The residue is purified by flash column chromatography on 130 g of silica gel (Note 12) eluting with pentane (450 mL). The fractions containing product are collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation (11 mmHg, room temperature) to afford 13.1\u201313.2 g (91\u201392%) of pure 1-methyl-3,4-dihydronaphthalene as a clear oil (Notes 13, 14).",

(E)-Methyl 2-diazo-4-phenylbut-3-enoate. 2-Carboxyethyl-triphenylphosphonium chloride (26.7 g, 72.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is added to a flame-dried, 2-necked 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a rubber septum and an argon inlet adaptor. The flask is evacuated (0.05 mmHg) and filled with argon two times after which a positive argon pressure is maintained on the flask. Benzaldehyde (6.07 mL, 6.37 g, 60.0 mmol) (Note 15) and THF (130 mL) (Note 16) are then added by syringe and the flask is externally cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath and vigorous stirring is begun. A solution of potassium tert-butoxide (16.8 g, 150 mmol, 2.5 equiv) in THF (80 mL) under an argon atmosphere and at 0 \u00b0C is then added via cannula under positive argon pressure over 30 min (Notes 16, 17). After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 30 min, then the ice-water bath is removed and stirring is continued for another 20 min. Dimethyl sulfate (11.4 mL, 15.1 g, 120 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 18) is then added rapidly by syringe and stirring is continued at ambient temperature for 2.5 h. The septum is then briefly removed from the flask and para-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide (18.7 g, 78.0 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 19) is added in one portion. The septum is replaced and the flask, under a positive argon pressure, is externally cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath. DBU (11.7 mL, 11.9 g, 78.0 mmol) (Note 20) is then added rapidly by syringe and the solution quickly becomes red. Stirring is continued at 0 \u00b0C for 4 h and then the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature and then is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (27 mmHg, ambient temperature) (Note 21). The residue is treated with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) and diethyl ether (400 mL) and the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and vigorously shaken. The aqueous layer is drained and the organic layer is washed with saturated ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) and then is dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (5 g) (Note 22). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (11 mmHg, room temperature) to give a dark-red oil. The oil is then adsorbed onto 50 g of silica gel, which is then placed at the top of a packed column of silica gel (350 g) (Note 23). The column is eluted with pentanes/diethyl ether, 12:1. The red fractions containing the product are collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation at room temperature to afford 9.3\u20139.7 g (77\u201380%) of 1 as a red solid (Note 24).",

            "(E)-2-Methyltetradeca-1,3-diene. Caution! tert-Butyllithium is extremely pyrophoric and care must be taken to avoid exposure to air at all times. A 2-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1) is equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a rubber septum pierced by an argon inlet needle and an outlet needle. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is flame-dried under argon, allowed to cool, and then charged by syringe with dry tetrahydrofuran (75 mL) (Note 2) and 2-bromopropene (6.24 mL, 70.2 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 3). The solution is cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in a dry ice/acetone bath and then a 1.58 M solution of tert-butyllithium in pentane (89.2 mL, 140 mmol, 2.6 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise by syringe over 20 min in ten roughly equal portions (Note 5). The resulting bright-yellow suspension is stirred for 10 min at \u221278 \u00b0C, then an additional portion of 2-bromopropene (0.65 mL, 7.3 mmol, 0.14 equiv) is added dropwise over 7 min. The resulting pale-yellow suspension is stirred for an additional 30 min at \u221278 \u00b0C (during which time the preparation of the lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP) solution is initiated) and is warmed to 0 \u00b0C by transfer into an ice bath for 10 min. The resulting pale-yellow solution is re-cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C (bath temperature) (Note 6).\nA 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a rubber septum pierced by an argon inlet needle and an outlet needle. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is flame-dried under argon, then is charged with dry pentanes (800 mL) (Note 7) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (18.2 mL, 108 mmol, 2.0 equiv) by syringe (Note 8). The colorless solution is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath and then a 1.57 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexanes (68.8 mL, 108 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise by syringe over 15 min in seven roughly equal portions (Note 9). The resulting yellow LTMP solution is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 30 min further and then is added via cannula (Note 10) over 15 min to the stirring pale-yellow suspension of 2-propenyllithium at \u221278 \u00b0C (Note 11). The resulting yellow suspension is transferred to an ice bath, is stirred for 30 min and then 1,2-epoxydodecane (11.8 mL, 54.0 mmol) (Note 8) is added dropwise by syringe in three roughly equal portions over 5 min. The ice bath is removed and the resulting yellow suspension is stirred for 2 h (Note 12).\nThe bright-yellow solution is re-cooled to 0 \u00b0C and 50 mL of a 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution is added by syringe over 5 min (Note 13). The reaction mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (200 mL). The reaction flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL), which is added to the separatory funnel. After thorough mixing, the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 760 mmHg to 15 mmHg) using a rotary evaporator to leave 18.6 g of a pale-yellow residue (Note 14).\nThe yellow residue is loaded neat onto a pad of silica gel (15 cm \u00d7 6 cm) (Note 15) that has already been wetted with n-pentane, and the flask is rinsed with pentane (2 \u00d7 10 mL) (Note 16). The pad is rinsed with 1000 mL of n-pentane and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction. Rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 760 mmHg to 15 mmHg) for 2 h (Note 17) gives 6.47 g (58%) (Note 18) of (E)-2-methyltetradeca-1,3-diene as a colorless oil (Note 19). The E/Z ratio of this product is determined to be 97:3 (Note 20)."

The resulting gray suspension is stirred for 1 min and is allowed to settle. The pentane is slowly removed by syringe and the process is repeated (Note 2). Tetrahydrofuran (300 mL) (Note 3) is added and the resulting gray suspension cooled to 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) using an ice-water-sodium chloride bath whereupon 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (6.4 mL, 87 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 4) is added drop wise via syringe at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 0 \u00b0C (approximately 10 min) [caution: gas evolution!]. When effervescence ceases the cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to warm to 22 \u00b0C (approximately 15 min) giving a slightly turbid, light gray mixture. The mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice-water-sodium chloride bath and benzyl chloromethyl ether (11.0 mL, 79 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise over 5 min by syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 30 min to produce a fine white suspension. The cooling bath is removed and the suspension is allowed to warm to 22 \u00b0C and is stirred for 1.75 h. The septum is removed and water (70 mL) is added. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and then extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 70 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 15 min, filtered and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined filtrates are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Note 6) and the residual colorless oil (19.3 g) is purified by short path distillation (Note 7). The fraction boiling at 79-80 \u00b0C/15 mmHg is collected to afford 15.8 g (72 mmol, 91%) (Note 8) of pure benzyloxymethoxy 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether (Note 9).",

The pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 98 mL of n-butyllithium (1.53 M in hexanes, 150 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 11). The reaction flask is cooled to -75 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with a dry ice-acetone bath and the n-butyllithium added dropwise over 40 min at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature below -70 \u00b0C. The resulting yellow solution is allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C slowly with stirring over 3.5 h while still in the cooling bath. Thereafter the dry ice-acetone bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to 20 \u00b0C over 30 min (Note 12), and maintained at this temperature for an additional 30 min. The turbid, yellow-orange reaction mixture is transferred by cannula to a vigorously-stirred slurry of 50 g of ice and 100 mL of brine, which is cooled with an ice-water bath. After complete transfer, 50 mL of diethyl ether is added and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 150 mL of diethyl ether-hexanes, 1:1) (Note 13).

A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal thermometer, two rubber septa and a 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar (Note 1) is charged with phenylacetylene (6.37 mL, 58.0 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2) via syringe, 60 mL of THF (Note 3) via syringe, and the solution was cooled to an internal temperature of -70 \u00b0C or colder in a dry ice/acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (1.58 M, 30.8 mL, 48.7 mmol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min directly into the stirring solution of phenylacetylene, such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. The acetone/dry ice bath is replaced with an ice/water bath. When the reaction temperature reaches approximately \u22125 \u00b0C, dichlorodimethylsilane (2.80 mL, 23.2 mmol) (Note 5) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min, such that the internal temperature does not exceed 10 \u00b0C. The ice bath is removed, the solution is allowed to stir at room temperature for 10 min (Note 6), and then the reaction mixture is poured slowly through an open joint into a 1-L round bottom flask containing a rapidly stirring solution of half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (200 mL) (Note 7). The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (5 g, Note 8), filtered through Celite 545 (Note 9), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg). The residue is then concentrated further at 1.5 mmHg for 4 h whereupon the residue solidifies (Note 10). The yellow-white solid is dissolved in a minimal amount of boiling hexanes (Note 11), and then is cooled in a freezer (\u221230 \u00b0C) for 16 h to afford the pure product as white needles that are collected by vacuum filtration (5.63 g, 93% yield) (Notes 12 and 13).",
            "B. 2,5-Dibromo-1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilole (2). From this point forward the light sensitivity of some compounds necessitates that certain flasks be wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two rubber septa, an internal thermometer, and 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar. Under a stream of argon (introduced through a septum with a syringe needle and balloon), lithium wire (0.53 g, 75.6 mmol, 4.5 equiv) (Note 14) is cut into (20-25) small pieces and washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 10 mL) to remove the protective oil. One septum is temporarily removed and a funnel is used to aid in the addition of the lithium pieces. The flask is then fitted with a gas adapter and evacuated (1.5 mmHg) for 10 min to ensure that all toluene is removed. The gas adapter is removed and naphthalene (10.12 g, 79.0 mmol, 4.7 equiv) (Note 15) is added with the aid of a funnel. The original septum is replaced and 50 mL of THF (Note 3) is added via syringe. The flask is sonicated for 1 h to facilitate dissolution of the lithium wire (Note 16), and the resulting dark green solution is left to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The lithium naphthalenide solution thus obtained is titrated according to a literature method3 and found to be 1.35-1.45 M (Note 17), and the flask is wrapped in foil.\nInto a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1) (4.37 g, 16.8 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon) is added 120 mL of THF via syringe (Note 3). The resulting silane solution is added to the lithium naphthalenide dropwise, over a minimum of 20 min, via cannula (Note 18). Once the addition is complete, the solution is cooled to -10 \u00b0C using an acetone bath with a small amount of dry ice.\nMeanwhile, a solution of anhydrous ZnCl2 (11.45 g, 84.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 19) in 70 mL of THF added via syringe (Notes 3 and 20) is prepared in a 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm stir bar and rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The ZnCl2 solution is added to the naphthalenide/silane mixture via cannula over a minimum of 20 min (Note 21). The acetone/dry ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 22).\nMeanwhile, a 1-L, three-necked, foil-wrapped, round-bottomed flask is charged with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 7.45 g, 41.9 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 23) and equipped with an internal thermometer, 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar and two rubber septa (one pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The flask is charged with 35 mL of THF via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C or colder using a dry ice/acetone bath. The room temperature silane solution is added into the cold NBS solution via cannula such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is stirred for a further 30 min at -70 \u00b0C or colder. One septum is removed and the cold mixture is slowly poured into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 300-mL solution of rapidly stirring half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (Notes 7 and 24). The heterogeneous mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 mL of half-saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 (Note 25), 200 mL of water, 200 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (7 g) and quickly filtered through a thin pad of silica (Note 26) into a foil wrapped 500-mL single-necked flask. The yellow solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and then at 1.5 mmHg for 1 h to give approximately 17 g of crude material (quantitative mass recovery based on both naphthalene and dibromosilole 2). 1H NMR analysis of a representative sample typically shows a 1:5.2 mixture of the dibromosilole (2) and naphthalene (Note 27), which corresponds to a 96% yield (6.78 g) of useable dibromosilole (2). It is generally unnecessary to remove the naphthalene for subsequent use, such as cross coupling reactions.\nIf necessary, the naphthalene can be removed by sublimation in small batches. Thus, 1.7 g of the naphthalene-silole mixture is ground into powder using a mortar and pestle, and sublimed in the dark, under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 3-4 hours at 35 \u00b0C (Note 28). This will typically remove 99% of the naphthalene according to 1H NMR analysis. If desired, further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the residual material from the combined sublimations in hot hexanes (160 mL) followed by cooling in a freezer for 16 h. The pure 2,5-dibromosilole crystallizes as white needles, which are vacuum-filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice cold hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 6.64 g (95% yield) of 2. (Note 29, 30 and 31). Dibromosilole 2 stored in the dark at room temperature is stable for several weeks. Even brief exposure to sunlight during processing will lead to significant decomposition (Notes 24 and 30)."

The flask is charged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (80 mL, Note 1) and cooled to 0 \u00b0C (external temperature) in an ice-bath. Vigorous stirring is commenced and (trimethylsilyl)acetylene (13.3 mL, 9.41 g, 95.8 mmol, 2.70 equiv, Note 2) is added to the flask via syringe. Butyllithium (40.6 mL, 95.8 mmol, 2.36 M, 2.70 equiv, Note 3) is added to the THF solution of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene over 10 min via syringe as the mixture was kept at 0 \u00b0C. After 5 min, the colorless solution of the lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide is removed from the ice-bath and allowed to warm to ambient temperature and kept at this temperature for an additional 40 min. During this time, another flame-dried, 300-mL, single-neck round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2.5-cm football-shaped stir bar, charged with solid copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (19.71 g, 95.84 mmol, 2.700 equiv, Note 2), sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. The flask containing copper bromide is charged with tetrahydrofuran (80 mL, Note 1) and the mixture is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature). The lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide solution at ambient temperature is slowly transferred via cannula over 5 min to the cold (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature) flask containing copper bromide. The bright-yellow solution is maintained at \u221278 \u00b0C for an additional 5 min. The flask containing the yellow copper acetylide solution is moved from the dry ice-acetone bath to an ice-water bath and maintained for 20 min prior to use.\nA flame-dried, 500-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2.5-cm stir bar is charged with benzanilide (1, 7.00 g, 35.5 mmol, 1 equiv, Note 2), sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. Anhydrous dichloromethane (71 mL, Note 1) followed by 2-chloropyridine (13.4 mL, 16.1 g, 142 mmol, 4.00 equiv, Note 4) are added via syringe and the heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred and cooled by placement in a dry ice-acetone bath (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature). After 10 min, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf2O, 7.03 mL, 12.0 g, 42.6 mmol, 1.20 equiv, Note 2) is added via syringe over 2 min.

Stirring is maintained and the reaction flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter fitted with a reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a thermocouple temperature probe adapter. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the system is placed in a heating mantle filled with sand (Note 9) and the thermocouple is inserted through the adapter. The solution is heated at 85 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 7 h (Notes 10, 11). Heating and stirring are then interrupted, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (Notes 12, 13). After removing the nitrogen inlet and the water condenser, the reaction mixture is concentrated for 1 h by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg). The residue is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) and treated with activated charcoal (3.0 g) (Note 14). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 30 min and filtered in vacuo through a Celite pad (Note 15) in a B\u00fcchner funnel. The Celite is carefully washed with three 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate (Note 16) and the combined washings are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with aqueous HCl (2 M, 250 mL) (Note 17) and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 125 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with 200 mL of brine, then are retreated with charcoal (1.0 g) and MgSO4 (20 g) (Notes 18, 19), then are filtered through a second Celite pad in a B\u00fcchner funnel (Notes 15, 20), and concentrated under reduced pressure (45 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow solid (around 26 g, 95% yield) (Note 21) is dissolved in 80 mL of hot dichloromethane (35-38 \u00b0C), and about 140 mL of hexane (38 \u00b0C) is added until a light-yellow, homogeneous solution is obtained. The solution is cooled at \u221215 \u00b0C for 2 h and the resulting white crystals (21.8 g) are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (100 mL).

The solution is cooled at -15 \u00b0C overnight and a second crop of crystals is collected by suction filtration, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (20 mL). The two crops of crystals are combined and dried overnight at 0.1 mmHg to provide 23.2 g of cinnamyl-H-phosphinic acid (83%) as white crystals (Note 22)."

The filtrate was concentrated to half volume using a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, water bath temperature 28 \u00b0C), and then the remaining solution was treated with 1N HCl (50 mL) at room temperature to make it slightly acidic (Note 9). The solution was concentrated using a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, water bath temperature 28 \u00b0C) (Note 10), and then the resulting solid was collected by suction filtration with the aid of distilled water (Note 11). The solid was washed with a pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) mixture of diethyl ether and isopropyl alcohol (20:1, 50 mL) followed by diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 12). The remaining solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 250-mL round-bottomed flask (Note 13) and then was dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h to yield a light yellowish solid (14.4 g, 86%) (Note 14). To obtain analytically pure product, the crude material was dissolved in about 800 mL of boiling methanol in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask (Note 15). The flask was cooled to room temperature and let stand for 30 h. Upon storage in a \u2212 4 \u00b0C refrigerator for 3 days, the crystalline product was collected by suction filtration and was washed with 30 mL of pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) methanol (Note 16). The solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 250-mL round-bottomed flask and then was dried under vacuum at room temperature for 10 h to afford N-(4-acetamidophenylsulfonyl)-2-phenylacetamide as a white solid (9.91 g, 60%) (Notes 17, 18)."

            "A. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one (Note 1). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen outlet, internal temperature probe, 125-mL addition funnel (capped with a septum and nitrogen inlet), and a 65 \u00d7 20 mm egg-shaped magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen, then charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxycyclopentene (20.8 g, 133 mmol) (Note 2), hexanes (208 mL), and triethylamine (22.3 mL, 16.2 g, 160 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 3). The addition funnel is charged with hexanes (100 mL) and dichloroacetyl chloride (12.8 mL, 19.6 g, 133 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and this solution is added dropwise to the vigorously stirred reaction mixture at a rate that maintains effective stirring and an internal temperature below 30 \u00b0C (the addition requires 30-40 min). A white precipitate (Et3N\u00b7HCl) forms during the addition, turning to a brown slurry upon complete addition. The slurry is stirred for 12 h, at which time GC analysis shows approximately 10% starting enol ether (Note 4). An additional portion of dichloroacetyl chloride (1.5 mL, 2.3 g, 16 mmol, 0.12 equiv) in 3 mL of hexanes is added to the reaction mixture via the addition funnel. After 1 h (Note 5), GC/MS analysis shows no remaining starting material. A sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel (8 cm diameter, 350 mL capacity) is charged with 40 g of silica gel (Note 6) slurried in hexanes, and the reaction mixture is filtered with suction through this pad into a 2-L filter flask rinsing with an additional 600 mL of hexanes in three portions. The clear, pale-yellow filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a pale-yellow liquid which crystallizes to a yellow solid when stored in the freezer (7 \u00b0C ) (29.9 g, 112 mmol, 84% yield) (Note 7). This material is used without further purification in the next step.",
            "B. 1-Trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one. A 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, adapter with internal temperature probe, reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a septum with nitrogen outlet is purged with nitrogen, then charged with 2-propanol (350 mL, Note 3) and nitrogen is bubbled through the solvent for 15 min via a 30-cm, 18 gauge needle. The mechanical stirrer, fitted with a 60 X 20 mm Teflon paddle, is started at 120\u2013150 rpm. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one (29.9 g, 112 mmol) is dissolved in 50 mL of 2-propanol (gentle heating is required) and added to the reaction flask, rinsing with an additional 50 mL, then 20 mL of 2-propanol. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the solution for 15 min. The septum is removed and replaced with a glass funnel, through which 10% Pd/C (5.98 g, 50% w/w in water) is added, the septum is replaced, and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The septum is removed again, replaced with a glass funnel, and sodium formate is added in a single portion (38.1 g, 559 mmol, 5.0 equiv, Note 3), rinsing with 25 mL of 2-propanol The septum is replaced and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The flask is heated in an oil bath to an internal temperature of 80 \u00b0C, and is maintained at this temperature with stirring for 18 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and a 60-\u03bcL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 \u03bcL of ether. A 4-\u03bcL sample of this solution is analyzed by GC (Note 4), and shows complete conversion. The slurry is filtered with suction through a pad of Celite (8 cm diameter sintered glass funnel, 350 mL volume, with a 4 cm pad of Celite), into a 1-L filter flask rinsing with four 50-mL portions of 2-propanol. The filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to a cloudy, yellow oil, which is then diluted with 150 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, Note 3) and then is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with three portions of half-saturated brine (75 mL each), once with saturated brine, then is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a clear, orange oil (17.2 g, 86.7 mmol, 77% yield) (Note 8) with traces of MTBE and 2-propanol. This material is used without further purification in the next reaction.",
            "C. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione. A three-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal temperature probe, 50-mL addition funnel with nitrogen inlet, a septum with nitrogen outlet and magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen and charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]-heptan-6-one (17.1 g, 81.0 mmol) and 33 mL each of 2-propanol and water. The solution is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with an ice-water bath, and 26 mL of 2:1 water-acetic acid (v/v) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 30 min. At this rate of addition, the internal temperature remains below 5 \u00b0C throughout the addition. The solution is then allowed to stir for 16 h and gradually come to room temperature. A 60-\u03bcL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 \u03bcL of ether from which a 4-\u03bcL sample is used for GC analysis (Note 4), which shows complete conversion to cycloheptane-1,3-dione. The reaction mixture is poured into 200 mL of MTBE in a 500-mL separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with an additional 100 mL of MTBE. The organic solutions are combined, washed with 50 mL of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration through cotton, rinsing with 50 mL MTBE and concentration on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C water bath) provides the crude product as a clear, amber oil. 1H NMR analysis shows the diketone contaminated with residual MTBE and acetic acid. The oil is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, and treated with 22.5 g of silica gel (Note 6). Concentration on the rotary evaporator provides a tan, free-flowing solid, which is placed on the top of a 7.5 \u00d7 23 cm column of silica gel packed as a slurry in hexane/Et2O, 2:1. The column is eluted with hexane/Et2O, 2:1 (500 mL) and 1:1 (3.8 L), followed by combination of the product-containing fractions (TLC in hexane/Et2O, 1:1, visualization with p-anisaldehyde stain). The combined fractions are concentrated via rotary evaporator, under vacuum (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide cycloheptane-1,3-dione as a clear, pale-yellow oil (6.69 g, 53.1 mmol, 61% yield). This material is approximately 95% pure as determined by 1H NMR analysis and is suitable for most subsequent uses, although the chromatographed material fails combustion analysis. If necessary, further purification can be achieved by short path vacuum distillation (Notes 9, 10, and 11)."

After purging the reaction flask with argon, the resulting mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath. To this solution is added via syringe 30% aq.hydrogen peroxide (11 mL, ~102 mmol) over 5 min (Note 19), followed by addition of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (1.68 g, 40 mmol) in one portion. The resulting solution is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. After being stirred for 18 h (Note 20), the reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath, and the reaction is quenched with 1.5 M aqueous Na2SO3 solution (40 mL). The resulting mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and is extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 80 mL) (Note 21). The aqueous layer is transferred to a 250-mL single-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath.

The flask is charged with 0.857 g (22.6 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride and THF (56 mL) (Notes 1 and 23). (CAUTION: lithium aluminum hydride is very reactive and must be handled carefully to avoid contact with water). The resulting suspension is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath, and a solution of (2R,3R)-2,3- dimethylsuccinic acid (1.10 g, 7.53 mmol) in THF (24 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min from the dropping funnel (Note 24), which is rinsed with THF (4 mL). The resulting suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath for 12 h (Note 25). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath and is diluted with ethyl ether (80 mL). Water (0.9 mL) is added dropwise slowly (Note 26), followed after 5 min by 3 M aq. sodium hydroxide solution (0.9 mL) and, after 5 min, more water (2.6 mL). The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and is stirred at this temperature for 2 h. The white precipitate is removed by filtration of the mixture through a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel lined with filter paper (Whatman 90 mm thick qualitative circles) fitted onto a 100-mL filter flask. The white residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. After breaking the precipitate into small pieces with a metal spatula, THF (20 mL) is added and then the suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath with vigorous stirring for 60 min (Note 27). The precipitate is removed by filtration through a medium-porosity, glass-fritted B\u00fcchner funnel into a 100-mL filter flask and is washed with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 20 mL). The combined filtrates are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (6 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to afford the crude product as a light yellow oil (Note 28). The product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (Note 29) to afford 0.80 g (90%) of (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol as a viscous, clear oil (Notes 30, 31, and 32)."

Under argon atmosphere, sodium hydride (6.10 g, 0.153 mol, 1.77 equiv) (Note 10) and diethyl ether (110 mL) (Note 11) are added. Bromo ester 1 (17.9 g, 0.0864 mol, 1.00 equiv) is then added via cannula using 10 mL of diethyl ether to complete the transfer. The argon inlet needle is removed, leaving the reaction solution vented to a bubbler. The reaction mixture is brought to reflux (oil bath set to 45 \u00b0C) before ethanol (1.1 mL, 0.019 mol, 0.22 equiv) (Note 12) is added (CAUTION: addition of the ethanol should be done slowly over the course of several minutes to prevent excessive hydrogen gas evolution). The resulting, light-brown solution is stirred at reflux for 15 h (reaction progress can be monitored by GC-MS, Note 13). The reaction mixture is then cooled and the precipitated tan solid is filtered through a 1 cm pad of Celite\u00ae in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (8.5 cm ID).

The flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath to \u221278 \u00b0C (temperature of the bath is checked with a thermometer, internal temperature is not monitored) (Note 3) and anhydrous, degassed pentane (80 mL) (Notes 4, 5) is added by syringe. A solution of t-butyllithium in pentane (1.7 M, 23.8 mL, 40.4 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 6) is added dropwise by syringe over 5 min, and the reaction mixture is maintained at \u221278 \u00b0C for another 1.5 h. The mixture is slowly allowed to reach room temperature with stirring over 16 h. The solution is concentrated in vacuo at 0.01 mmHg. Cold anhydrous, degassed THF (70 mL at \u221278 \u00b0C, kept in a dry ice-acetone bath) (Notes 5, 7) is added by syringe to the Schlenk tube which is immersed in a cold bath at \u221278 \u00b0C.

An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 200-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel (placed in the central neck of the flask and fitted with a rubber septum) and a 3.2 cm \u00d7 1.6 cm, egg shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with sodium borohydride (30.0 g, 0.793 mol, 2.4 equiv) (Note 1) and 500 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The resulting suspension is cooled in an ice bath and stirred rapidly. The pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a previously prepared solution of iodine (83.9 g, 0.331 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) in 150 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The iodine-THF solution is added dropwise to the borohydride-THF suspension over 1.5 h (Note 4). Once addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted to the central neck of the flask. (S)-Phenylglycine (50.0 g, 0.331 mol) (Note 5) is then added to the mixture in small portions (Note 6). After the (S)-phenylglycine has been added, the ice-bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 18 h (Note 7). After this period, the solution removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-bath for 20 min, then 60 mL of methanol is very cautiously added (Note 8). After evolution of gas has ceased, the reaction mixture is diluted with 250 mL of anhydrous THF and triethylamine (48.6 mL, 35.3 g, 0.347 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 9) is added in one portion. With vigorous stirring, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (72.9 g, 0.334 mol, 1.01 equiv) is added portionwise (Note 10), followed by 200 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 11). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 3 h. After this time, the solvents are removed in vacuo (Note 12) and the resulting white solid is suspended in 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 300 mL of water and stirred vigorously. The white residues are dispersed by the gradual addition of 400 mL of a 1:1 solution of 1.2 N aqueous HCl and brine. After being stirred for 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel and is shaken with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are then shaken with a 1:1 solution of 0.6 N HCl and brine (200 mL), followed by a 1:1 solution of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine (200 mL), and finally, water (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (100 g), filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo (Note 12) to leave 100 mL of mother liquor. After addition of 300 mL of hexane, the solution is chilled at \u221220 \u00b0C for 12 h to induce precipitation. The mixture is then filtered through a 90 -mm B\u00fcchner funnel (fitted with 90-mm diameter Whatman 1 filter paper) to obtain crude tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate and the filtrate is kept. The crude product is purified by repeated recrystallization from dichloromethane-cyclohexane (3 crops) (Note 13) to afford 71.1 g (91%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate as white needles after drying in vacuo (Note 12). The clear filtrate kept from each recrystallization is combined, concentrated in vacuo (Note 12), and the resulting mixture (usually an off-white solid or a sticky cream foam) purified by column chromatography (Note 14) yielding a further 2.68 g (3.4%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate after removal of solvents and drying in vacuo (Note 12). Total yield of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate is 73.8 g (94%) obtained as white needles (Note 15).",

The trituration is repeated twice more or until the resulting benzene layer is colorless (Note 5). The residual solvent is removed from the mixture with a rotary evaporator (ca. 40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The remaining tan solid is further dried under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at room temperature for 8 h to afford a light tan powder (6.15 g, 94%) (Note 6). To further purify the product, the tan powder is transferred to a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel (60 mm \u00d7 100 mm (d \u00d7 h)) fitted with a Whatman 1 filter paper (55 mm) where it is washed with three, 30-mL portions of a cold (\u221240 \u00b0C) mixture of dichloromethane/hexane, 2:1 (Note 7) in a B\u00fcchner funnel to remove colored impurities. The solid is then dried under vacuum (90 \u00b0C, 0.1 mmHg) for 16 h and then is cooled to ambient temperature to afford 4.96 g (76%) of the sodium salt as a free-flowing, fine, white powder (Notes 8 and 9). Typically, the salt is stored at ambient temperature in a glove-box.",

The flask is then charged with bis[1,2:5,6-\u03b7-(1,5-cyclooctadiene)]nickel (1.38 g, 5.00 mmol) (Note 10) and is removed from the glove-box. Under argon from a Schlenk line, the flask is charged with anhydrous diethyl ether (80 mL) (Note 11) and is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/2-propanol bath, at which time allyl bromide (0.440 mL, 0.615 g, 5.08 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 12) is added via syringe with stirring. The cold bath is removed and replaced by a ice-water bath. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C gradually (ca. 15 min), then to ambient temperature over another 15 min by removing the cold bath (Note 13). The reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for another 30 min and then is transferred into the glove-box. The volatile contents of the flask are removed under high vacuum (ca. 0.1 mmHg) by connecting the flask to an evacuation port inside the glove-box (Note 14).

A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser (fitted with a nitrogen inlet), a rubber septum, and a magnetic stir bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with nitrogen. The flask is then charged with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (43.4 g, 121 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 18) through one neck of the flask under a strong flow of nitrogen and then quickly sealed with the rubber septum. Anhydrous THF (500 mL) (Note 19) is added into the flask through the rubber septum. The contents of the flask are then treated with n-BuLi (76.0 mL, 1.6 M solution in hexanes, 121 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 20) at ambient temperature and the mixture is stirred for 2 h. Propiophenone (13.4 mL, 101 mmol) (Note 21) is then added dropwise via syringe over a period of 15 min. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 8 h. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature and 400 mL of hexane/diethyl ether, 1:1 (Note 22) is added. The resulting suspension is filtered through a pad of Celite (ca. 15 g, 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm) in a fritted glass filter funnel [5.0 cm \u00d7 12 cm, (d \u00d7 h) coarse] which is washed with 100 mL of hexane/diethyl ether, 1:1 (Note 23). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow slurry is first taken up in dichloromethane (30 mL) and then is triturated with hexane (200 mL) and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The remaining slurry is treated in the same manner twice more (Note 24). The combined extracts are filtered through a silica plug (ca. 20 g, 3 cm long, 5 cm in diameter), which is washed with 50 mL of hexane. The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg).

            "D. (R)-3-Methyl-3-phenylpentene (7).2 The pre-catalyst is prepared as follows in a glove-box: A 100-mL, pear-shaped Schlenk flask with one side-arm fitted with a rubber septum and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with argon. The flask is charged with anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 27) and is transferred into a glove-box (Note 28). To the flask is quickly added [di(\u03bc-bromo)bis(\u03b7-allyl)nickel(II) (180 mg, 0.50 mmol, 0.01 equiv), (R)-2,2'-binaphthoyl-(S,S)-di(1-phenylethyl)aminoylphosphine (539 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 29) and NaBArF24 (886 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) in the order mentioned. The resulting suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a dark-brown solution containing a small amount of fine particles (NaBr).\nA 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a Teflon-taped flow-controlled argon inlet, a thermometer, and a magnetic stir bar is flame-dried and purged with argon. The flask is then charged with 150 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 27). The catalyst solution prepared above, now removed from the drybox, is introduced to the vessel via cannula. The flask containing the catalyst solution is further rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane, and this solution is also transferred to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of pre-catalyst transfer, the system closed at the flow-controlled stopcock and then is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, creating a small vacuum. A strong flow of dry ethylene (Note 30) is introduced through a needle through the serum stopper to relieve the vacuum and then is adjusted to maintain a pressure of 1 atm by releasing excess gas through an oil bubbler. The introduction of the ethylene causes the internal temperature to rise. Within ca. 5 min, the internal temperature increases by 5 \u00b0C and the ethylene line is removed (Note 31). The solution is cooled back to \u221270 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring. A solution of 2-phenyl-1-butene (6) (6.60 g, 50.0 mmol) in 30 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 27) is introduced as a weak stream into the solution of pre-catalyst over a two-minute period via syringe followed by a 10 mL rinse with dichloromethane. Ethylene is introduced again through a needle, first as a strong flow and then regulated to maintain a pressure of 1 atm. Under an ethylene atmosphere, the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is then maintained between \u221265 \u00b0C and \u221270 \u00b0C for a period of 4 h. At the end of this period the ethylene line is removed and the reaction mixture is slowly poured into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 mL of pentane (Note 32) is and combined with a 50-mL pentane rinse of the reaction vessel. After being warmed to ambient temperature, the resulting, cloudy solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (Merck, grade 9385, mesh 230-400, 60 \u00c5, 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm, (d \u00d7 h)), which is eluted with 100 mL of pentane (Note 33). The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 7.99 g (99.7%) of (R)-3-methyl-3-phenylpentene (er 98.8:1.2) as a clear, liquid (Notes 34 and 35)."

A solution of 3-phenylpropanoyl chloride (14.84 g, 87.97 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 5) in THF (42.5 mL) is added via the addition funnel to the solution while the temperature is kept between \u221270 and \u221260 \u00b0C. Addition is completed after 20 min and stirring is continued for 30 min further (Note 6). The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, quenched with half-saturated aq. NH4Cl solution (210 mL) and then is transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel where it is extracted twice with EtOAc (160 mL, 25 mL). The combined organic phases are washed consecutively with water (105 mL), sat. aq. NaHCO3 solution (21 mL), and half-saturated brine (105 mL). After being dried over MgSO4 (8 g, 30 min), the organic phase is filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, then the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) and then is dried at 0.2 mmHg for 8 h at room temperature. The crude product (35 g) is dissolved in refluxing tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) (105 mL) and hexane (215 mL) is added slowly over 20 min. At the end of the addition, precipitation occurs. The mixture is then cooled in an ice bath for 2 h and is filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel to obtain the pure product, which is dried (23 \u00b0C at 0.08 mmHg) for 4 h to obtain 29.6 g (89%) of 1 as colorless needles (Note 7).",
            "B. (2R,4S) [2-Benzyl-3-(4-isopropyl-2-oxo-5,5-diphenyl-3-oxazolidinyl)-3-oxopropyl]carbamic acid benzyl ester (2). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a 150-mL, pressure-equalizing, addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet, Teflon-coated thermocouple, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stirring bar (Note 8), is charged under a nitrogen atmosphere with 1 (28.9 g, 70.0 mmol) and dichloromethane (280 mL) (Note 9). The clear, colorless solution is cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C (ethanol/dry ice bath). A solution of TiCl4 in dichloromethane (1 M, 73.5 mL, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 10) is added dropwise via cannula keeping the temperature between -50 and \u221240 \u00b0C (Note 11). Then a 1 M solution of triethylamine in dichloromethane is added via syringe (ca. 3 mL) until the dark red color of the enolate persists (Note 12). More triethylamine (10.19 mL, 7.4 g, 73 mmol, 1.05 equiv) in dichloromethane (70 mL) is slowly added over 10 min keeping the temperature between \u221240 and \u221235 \u00b0C. After stirring the reaction mixture for 20 min further at this temperature, a solution of benzyl isopropoxymethyl carbamate (16.4 g, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 eq) (Note 13) in dichloromethane (80 mL) is added over 10 min via the addition funnel, followed by one more equivalent of the 1 M TiCl4 solution in dichloromethane (73.5 mL, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) via cannula keeping the temperature at \u221240 \u00b0C (Note 10). After 10 min, the cooling bath is replaced by an ice bath and the reaction mixture stirred for 3 h at 0\u20132 \u00b0C (Note 6). The yellow reaction mixture is quenched with a solution of sat. aq. NH4Cl solution (300 mL) and water (100 mL), then is stirred for 5 min and is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with half-saturated brine, dried over MgSO4 (15 g, 30 min), filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) and dried in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 0.08 mmHg) for 5 h to afford the crude product as a pale-yellow foam (42.7 g) (Note 14). The residue is dissolved, with stirring, in 250 mL of refluxing tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME). During the addition of hexane (150 mL) some seed crystals were added (Note 15, 16). The mixture is allowed to cool for 30 min and then is heated back to reflux. Another portion of hexane (100 mL) is added and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, then are washed with two 100-mL portions of a mixture of ice-cold hexane/TBME, 2:1. After a second recrystallization from hexane/TBME, 1:1 (250 mL each), the isolated crystals are dried in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 0.15 mmHg) for 8 h at room temperature to provide 21.05 g (52%) of the product 2 as colorless, diastereomerically pure microcrystals (Notes 17, 18).",
            "C. (R)-2-(Benzyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-3-phenylpropanoic acid (3). A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer (fitted with an 8-cm Teflon paddle), and a Teflon-coated thermocouple is charged with 2 (20.0 g, 34.9 mmol), THF (204 mL) and water (102 mL). Hydrogen peroxide (30%, 14.3 mL, 139.6 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 19) is then added and the resulting mixture cooled to 0\u20135 \u00b0C in an ice bath. Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (2.34 g, 55.8 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 20) is added and stirring is continued at 0\u20135 \u00b0C for 2 h (Notes 6, 21). The suspension is allowed to warm to room temperature, then is slowly diluted with aq. Na2SO3 solution (20 g in 160 mL, 158 mmol) (Note 22, 23) followed by 1 M aq. NaOH solution (102 mL) and stirring is continued at room temperature for 10 min. The THF is removed on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg, 30 min) and TBME (635 mL) is added to the resulting suspension. After the mixture is stirred for 10 min, the precipitate (recovered DIOZ auxiliary) is filtered off by suction through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel and is successively washed with 1 M aq. NaOH solution (101 mL), water (2 \u00d7 83 mL) and TBME (2 \u00d7 83 mL) (Note 24). The filtrate and all aqueous washes are combined and acidified to pH 2-3 with 0.52 M aq. citric acid solution (Note 25) and then are transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and are extracted with TBME (2 \u00d7 255 mL). The combined TBME phases are washed with brine (255 mL), dried over MgSO4 (19 g, 10 min), filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel and concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg). The resulting oil slowly solidifies upon standing (Note 26) to afford 10.70 g (98%) of 3 with an enantiomer ratio of = 99.9:0.1 (Notes 27, 28, 29)."
