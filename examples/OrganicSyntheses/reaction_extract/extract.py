    You will be given a reaction title and a synthesis procedure. Please summarize the following details in a table: Reactants, Reactant amounts, Products, Product amounts, solvents, reaction temperature, reaction time and yield. If any information is not provided or you are unsure, use "N/A" in the cell.   

    If multiple reactions are provided, use multiple rows to represent them. If multiple units or components are provided for the same factor (e.g. g and mol for the weight, multiple linker or metals, multiple temperature and reaction time, mixed solvents, etc.), include them in the same cell and separate by comma.
    If multiple Reactants, Reactant amounts, Products, Product amounts, reaction temperature, reaction time are present, separate them using a comma in the same cell.
    Output table should have 8 columns: | Reactants | Reactant amounts | Products | Product amounts | Solvents | Reaction temperature | Reaction time | Yield |

    Some advice to find amount, reaction temperature, reaction time and yield.
    The amount often consists of numbers and units and is not far from the corresponding compound.
    Solvent should only include the solvents of the reaction process, and should not include the solvents added in the washing, recrystallization and other processes.
    Reaction temperature indicates the temperature at which the main reaction is taking place. The reaction temperature is generally numerical, but expressions such as reflux and heat are also expressions of reaction temperature.
    Reaction time is the time during which the reaction takes place, generally in the second half of the description of the reaction conditions, before the product description.
    Yield is the ratio of the actual amount of product produced to the theoretical yield, and is often labeled near the yield of the product. The yield is often a percentage.

    Example 1:
    Title:<'''ALKYL AND ALKYLENE BROMIDES'''>
    Procedure:<'''A given primary alcohol is treated with 25 per cent excess of aqueous (48 per cent) hydrobromic acid (Note 1) together with sulfuric acid (Note 2). The mixture is refluxed (Note 3) in order to convert the alcohol as completely as possible into the corresponding bromide, and the latter is then removed from the reaction mixture by distillation. The water-insoluble layer is separated; washed successively with water, cold concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 4), and a sodium carbonate solution; separated; dried with calcium chloride (Note 5); and distilled. Slight variations from this procedure depend upon the physical and chemical properties of the alcohol used, or of the bromide formed in the reaction. For example, in the preparations of ethyl and allyl bromides, the reaction mixture is not refluxed because of the volatility of the former compound, and because of the chemical reactivity of the latter; in the preparation of iso-amyl bromide, too large a proportion of sulfuric acid may produce appreciable decomposition, whereas halides of high molecular weight, because of their low volatility, are separated from the reaction mixture mechanically, instead of by distillation.\nThe use of a modified sodium bromide-sulfuric acid method (Note 6) for the preparation of alkyl bromides is described in connection with the preparation of n-butyl bromide. This method has been used also for the preparations of iso-amyl and trimethylene bromides, but, in general, the yields were found to be somewhat lower than those obtained with the hydrobromic-sulfuric acid method.'''>

    Title:<'''ALKYL AND ALKYLENE BROMIDES'''>
    Procedure:<'''DOI: 10.15227/orgsyn.001.0003\n(B) iso-AMYL BROMIDE, (CH3)2CHCH2CH2Br\n[Butane, 1-bromo-3-methyl-]\nIn a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, a hydrobromic acid solution is prepared (p. 26) by passing sulfur dioxide into a mixture of 1100 g. of crushed ice and 1 kg. (314 cc., 6.25 moles) of bromine. This is equivalent to a mixture of 2.1 kg. (12.5 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 600 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid. There are then added, in the order mentioned, 880 g. (1086 cc., 10 moles) of iso-amyl alcohol (b.p. 130\u2013132\u00b0) and 100 g. (54.5 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid. The clear homogeneous solution is refluxed gently during a period of five to six hours. Even during the early stages of the heating, the separation of iso-amyl bromide is observed, and the reaction appears to be complete after about one hour. The product is isolated as in the preparation of n-butyl bromide below.\nA yield of 1435 g. of crude product is obtained. After purification with concentrated sulfuric acid the product weighs 1410 g. (93 per cent of the theoretical amount). Upon fractionation, however, it is found that appreciable amounts of a high-boiling product are present, and therefore the yield of fractionated material boiling over the range 116\u2013120\u00b0 varies in different experiments from 1330 to 1360 g. (88\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount).'''>

    Example 3:
    Title:<'''4-METHYLESCULETIN'''>
    Procedure:<'''A smooth, uniform paste is made by thoroughly mixing 60 g. (0.45 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate (p. 235) (Note 1) and 114 g. (0.45 mole) of hydroxyhydroquinone triacetate (p. 317). This requires several minutes of stirring. To this mixture is added 450 cc. of 75 per cent sulfuric acid (Note 2). The paste slowly dissolves with the evolution of heat, giving a deep red solution; the latter is heated on a warm bath with occasional stirring until it reaches 80\u00b0, at which temperature it is maintained for one-half hour. It is then allowed to cool to room temperature and poured into 1850 cc. of cold water. The resulting mixture is cooled to room temperature, filtered with suction, and the precipitate washed with cold water to free it from excess acid. The 4-methylesculetin thus obtained is dried at 100\u00b0 and is generally gray in color. The yield is about 80 g. (92 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nA pure product may be obtained by dissolving, with the aid of heat and stirring, 100 g. of 4-methylesculetin in a solution of 200 g. of borax in 700 cc. of water. The solution obtained is filtered while hot and then cooled, whereupon the esculetin borate separates (Note 3). This is filtered off and dissolved in 1800 cc. of water, and the solution thus obtained added to 50 g. (27.2 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 500 cc. of water. 4-Methylesculetin separates and, after the mixture has been cooled, is filtered, washed, and dried. From 100 g. of the crude material, 85 g. of pure product melting at 272\u2013274\u00b0 (uncorr.) is obtained. This is generally nearly colorless but occasionally possesses a slight grayish tinge.'''>

(2 moles) of 1,3-dichloro-2-butene (Note 1) and 1.25 l. of 10% sodium carbonate are heated at reflux temperature for 3 hours. The 3-chloro-2-buten-1-ol is extracted with three 300-ml. portions of ether, which are then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Fenske column, and the residue is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask, yielding 134 g.

Anhydrous liquid ammonia (3 l.) is introduced through a small hole in the plastic cover, and 1.5 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate is added followed by 65 g. (2.8 g. atoms) of clean, freshly cut sodium. The mixture is stirred until all the sodium is converted into sodium amide, after which 134 g. (1.26 moles) of 3-chloro-2-buten-1-ol is added over a period of 30 minutes. The mixture is stirred overnight, then 148 g. (2.8 moles) of solid ammonium chloride is added in portions at a rate that permits control of the exothermic reaction.

Exothermic reaction), and the mixture is heated under reflux by maintaining the original bath temperature for 24 hours. A thick pink-colored precipitate is formed almost immediately and remains throughout the reaction.\nAt the end of the 24-hour period, the ethanol is removed under reduced pressure on a steam bath.

A 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a tantalum wire Hershberg stirrer, a condenser, and a separatory funnel, is arranged for use of a nitrogen atmosphere.2 Magnesium (19.2 g., 0.79 g. atom) and 100 ml. of dry ether3 are placed in the flask, and a solution of 100 g. (91 ml., 0.79 mole) of benzyl chloride in 500 ml. of dry ether is added in a period of 1.5\u20132.0 hours, with stirring, while the mixture boils spontaneously.

    Procedure:<'''In a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer are placed 38.3 g. (0.30 mole) of p-chloroaniline (Note 1), 41 ml. (0.6 mole) of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9), and 21 ml. (0.35 mole) of carbon disulfide. The mixture is stirred vigorously, and when it is heated to 30\u00b0 the reaction starts. The temperature is maintained at 30\u201335\u00b0 by external cooling (Note 2). The reaction mixture turns into a deep-red turbid solution within a few minutes, and then suddenly a heavy yellow precipitate of ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate separates. To the mixture 15 ml. of water is added, and stirring is continued for 1 hour. The mixture is filtered with suction, and the residue is washed with two 30-ml. portions of a 3% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and with two 15-ml. portions of 96% ethanol.\nThe ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate obtained is transferred immediately to a 1-l. beaker fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. Water (250 ml.) is added, and the temperature is raised to 30\u00b0. A solution of 28.4 g. (0.30 mole) of chloroacetic acid in 30 ml. of water is neutralized with sodium carbonate [18.6 g. (0.15 mole) of Na2CO3\u00b7H2O in 70 ml. of water] and is added to the well-stirred dithiocarbamate suspension over a 10-minute period (Note 3). In the beginning the suspension gradually becomes less viscous, but at the end of the addition it rapidly turns into a creamy mass. Another 250 ml. of water is added to facilitate stirring, which is continued for 1 hour after the addition at about 30\u00b0.\nThe creamy suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the electrodes of a pH meter are inserted (Note 4). A solution of 20.5 g. (0.15 mole) of zinc chloride (Note 5) in 75 ml. of water is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a period of 45 minutes, while the pH is maintained at 7 by the simultaneous dropwise addition of a 4N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (Note 6). The mixture is stirred for 1 hour and is then filtered with suction; the solid product is dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide. The dry material is slurried with 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0), and the solvent is decanted. This process is repeated five times, and the combined extract is evaporated at reduced pressure. The yield of almost pure p-chlorophenyl isothiocyanate, obtained as a readily crystallizing oil with a pleasant anise-like odor, is 33\u201335 g. (65\u201368%), m.p. 44\u201345\u00b0.

One hundred milliliters of a chilled aqueous solution containing 50 g. of sodium hydroxide is added slowly while the bottle is rotated (Note 7). The contents are stored for approximately 4\u20135 days in a refrigerator (5\u00b0) and are shaken occasionally. During this time most of the solid dissolves, but a slight amount remains as a yellow sludge and the liquid assumes a yellow to amber color. The mixture is filtered, and the insoluble material is discarded. An excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate. The entire resulting mixture containing a white solid is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered into a 1-l. flask. The ether is carefully removed by distillation using a hot-water bath to give a yellow oil which solidifies when cooled. The product is recrystallized from 500 ml. of benzene. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with benzene until the filtrate is colorless. The air-dried product (Note 8) weighs 40\u201348 g.
