To the flask are added 3.86 g (3.90 mL, 40.2 mmol) of 2-cyclohexenone (Note 6), 200 mL of 1,4-dioxane (Note 7), and 20 mL of water via syringe, and the entire orange mixture is immersed in a oil bath preheated to 120\u00b0C and heated at 105\u00b0C for 3 hr. After the solvent is cooled to room temperature, it is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. After concentration of the initial reaction mixture on a rotary evaporator, the residue is dissolved in diethyl ether (100 mL). The resulting solution is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and washed with 1.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl, 100 mL) followed by 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (100 mL).

A dry, 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and a reflux condenser attached to a gas-flow adapter with a stopcock, is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 3.95 g (25.2 mmol) of bromobenzene (Note 10) and 12.5 mL of dry diethyl ether (Note 11) via syringe, and cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath. At this temperature, 16.7 mL (25.1 mmol) of a 1.50 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane (Note 12) is added. The ice-water bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath, and 2.59 g (24.9 mmol) of trimethoxyborane (Note 13) is added dropwise over a period of 10 min via syringe. The mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 30 min and slowly warmed to room temperature by removal of the dry ice-acetone bath. In a second flask, a 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and a gas-flow adapter with a stopcock, are placed 74.7 mg (0.120 mmol) of (R)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl [(R)-BINAP] (Notes 3, 4), and 25.8 mg (0.100 mmol) of acetylacetonatobis(ethylene)rhodium(I) (Note 5). After the flask is flushed with nitrogen, 50 mL of 1,4-dioxane is added via syringe, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 10 min. To the first flask containing the phenylborate reagent, Lithium phenyltrimethoxyborate , are added successively, via syringe 0.975 g (10.1 mmol) of 2-cyclohexenone (Note 6), 0.54 mL of water, and the catalyst solution from the second flask. The entire mixture is heated in an oil bath at 100\u00b0C for 12 hr. After the solvent is cooled to room temperature, it is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The dark brown residue is diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL) and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The ether solution is washed with 10% hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide (100 mL). The aqueous layers are extracted with diethyl ether (30 mL each).

Stirring is started and the following reagents are added in the order indicated through a powder funnel: potassium ferricyanide (247 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), anhydrous potassium carbonate (104 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), methanesulfonamide (23.8 g, 0.25 mol, 1 equiv), potassium osmate dihydrate (46.1 mg, 0.125 mmol, 0.05 mol %), (DHQD)2PHAL [1,4-bis(9-O-dihydroquinidinyl)phthalazine, 486.9 mg, 0.625 mmol, 0.25 mol %], 1-phenylcyclohexene (1, 39.55 g, 0.25 mol) and tert-butyl alcohol (250 mL) (Notes 1 and 2). The slurry is stirred vigorously for 2 days at a rate of 500 rpm. During this time, the product crystallizes in the top organic phase, beginning after 4 hr. Also, the appearance of the slurry gradually changes from a mixture containing red granules (ferricyanide) to yellow flakes, which are presumably a salt of iron(II).\nAfter the reaction is complete the mixture is treated with ethyl acetate (250 mL) with stirring to dissolve the product. The resulting mixture is filtered through a 500-mL medium-fritted glass funnel and the flask and filter cake are washed with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the brown-colored aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is washed with 2 M potassium hydroxide (KOH, 2 \u00d7 50 mL) with vigorous shaking to remove methanesulfonamide , then dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4, 12.5 g). The solid is filtered, the cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 37 mL) and the filtrate is evaporated, to afford a white solid. After the crude product is dried under reduced pressure overnight, it weighs 47.44 g (99%) (Notes 3 and 4).",
            "B. (\u2212)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-Phenyl-1-cyclohexanol (3). A 1-L, three-necked flask is set up with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and nitrogen line. The flask is placed in a silicone oil bath (230 \u00d7 100-mm Schott crystallizing dish). The flask is charged with a slurry containing activated W-2 Raney nickel (257.5 g) in wet ethanol (70% v/v) through a powder funnel under a blanket of nitrogen. Caution-Fire Hazard! Raney nickel is extremely pyrophoric when dry and must be kept submerged under liquid at all times (Note 5). This is done by transferring an aqueous slurry of Raney nickel to the flask with the aid of 250 mL of anhydrous ethanol in portions, making sure that the catalyst does not dry. The crude diol from the previous step is added to the flask, using another 50 mL of anhydrous ethanol to complete the transfer. The mixture is stirred vigorously and refluxed for 2 hr (Note 6).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 40-50\u00b0C and filtered through a 1/2\"-layer of Celite in a 500-mL fritted (medium) glass funnel, making sure that the liquid level does not fall below the surface of the filter cake. A total of 300 mL of ethanol in small portions is used to transfer the slurry quantitatively to the funnel and to wash the filter cake. A 170-mm \u00d7 90-mm crystallizing dish is useful to cover the top of funnel during the filtration; however it is not necessary. The Raney nickel sludge is transferred with water to a waste container.\nThe filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove most of the ethanol and the resulting two-phase mixture is diluted with 50 mL of saturated brine and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic phase is dried over MgSO4 (3.75 g), filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure overnight to give the crude alcohol (35.53 g, 94.0% ee). The solid residue is crystallized from 75 mL of warm petroleum ether (bp 30-60\u00b0C). The crystallization is allowed to proceed for 3 hr at room temperature and 1 hr at 0\u00b0C. The crystalline mass is triturated with 25 mL of cold (0\u00b0C) pentane to break up the lumps. The slurry is filtered, washed with chilled pentane in portions (3 \u00d7 12.5 mL) and the solid is dried under reduced pressure overnight to constant weight, to afford 25.12 g (58% from 1) of colorless crystals, mp 64-65\u00b0C. The enantiomeric purity was found to be >99.5% ee by chiral stationary phase SFC (supercritical-fluid chromatography) (Notes 7-8)."

The reaction flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extractor, which is packed with 65 g of calcium chloride (CaCl2, anhydrous, 30 mesh) and a condenser with a drying tube. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 10 hr (Note 15). After the first 4 hr, the CaCl2 in the Soxhlet extractor is replaced; the total amount of CaCl2 used in the reaction is 130 g. Ultimately, the reaction mixture becomes a suspension. Removal of benzene under reduced pressure (Note 16) yields white solids that are dissolved in 310 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The solution is washed with water and 5% aqueous NaHCO3 in a separatory funnel until the CH2Cl2 solution becomes clear. After removal of CH2Cl2 under vacuum, the resulting white crystals are dissolved by boiling in 600 mL of absolute EtOH; the resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The white crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold EtOH, and dried at 60\u00b0C. Concentration of the mother liquor by rotary evaporation affords a residue that can also be recrystallized in absolute EtOH to provide additional product. The above described procedure is performed in duplicate, providing (5S,6R)-4-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenylmorpholin-2-one in yields of 21.7 g and 20.3 g (average yield for the two steps: 71%) (Notes 17-19)."

A 1H NMR spectrum indicated that the product contained some triphenylphosphine, thus the salt was washed again with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying, a considerably purer product (50.91 g) was obtained. The salt is used in the next step without further purification (Note 7).",

The other neck is connected to a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask via Tygon tubing (2 cm id) and two male 24/40 joints (Note 9). In the 1-L flask, 2-carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (50.91 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of dichloromethane. A glass tube is attached to the Tygon tubing such that the end extends several cm into the solution. Triethylamine (39.13 g, 53.8 mL, 386.7 mmol) is added to the 1-L flask, resulting in the immediate formation of a deep blue/purple solution; a condenser is attached to the second neck of the flask. Argon is then passed over the paraformaldehyde so that a steady stream of gas is constantly bubbling through the purple ylide solution. The paraformaldehyde is heated to 160\u00b0C (oil bath) in order to generate formaldehyde, which flows through the solution (Note 10). Upon completion of the addition of formaldehyde, the purple color of the ylide slowly changes from deep purple to brown over a period of 1-2 hr, indicating completion of the reaction. The resulting solution is poured into 500 mL of hexanes, forming a precipitate, which is removed by filtration. The precipitate is washed with 100 mL of hexanes and the combined filtrate and wash are concentrated at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator.

To a threaded glass, 200-mL reaction vessel, equipped with a Teflon stirring bar, is added methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate (10.35 g, 50.0 mmol), triphenylphosphine (3.23 g, 12.3 mmol) and 100 mL of acetonitrile (Note 15). The mixture is stirred for 10 min to dissolve the reagents. Palladium acetate (0.673 g, 3.00 mmol) (Note 16) is added; a yellow precipitate is immediately formed. The tube is attached to a pressure head (Note 17) and the solution is saturated with carbon monoxide (four cycles to 59 psi of CO) (Note 18). The reaction mixture is heated to 90\u00b0C (oil bath temperature) under CO (59 psi) for 50 hr. A red-brown solution forms after heating for a few minutes. In order to remove carbon dioxide that is formed and to monitor the progress of the reaction, the vessel is removed from the oil bath for 15 min, carefully vented, and repressurized with CO every 10-12 hr (Note 19). After 50 hr, the reaction mixture is cooled and concentrated using a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure, giving a dark brown/black oil. The crude product is purified by chromatography on a pre-packed 40 \u00d7 4 cm silica column (Note 11) using 7:3 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (0.80 L), then 1:1 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (2.80 L) as eluents affording methyl indole-4-carboxylate (7.95 g, 44.75 mmol, 91%) as a pale yellow solid (Note 20)."

The flask is placed in an ice bath and, after 10 min, a bubbler is connected through the septum, followed immediately by the addition of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (0.51 mL, 5.3 mmol, 1.05 eq). After removing the ice bath and stirring for 3 hr at ambient temperature, the resultant solution is filtered through a pad of Celite (diameter: 3 cm; height: 1 cm) (Note 12), which is washed with ether until the washes are clear (ca. 75 mL).\nThe alkyne cobalt complex is purified by silica gel chromatography. To the red solution is added 2 g of silica gel and the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Note 13). The silica gel is then placed under vacuum (1 mm) until effervescence ceases (about 10 min). The dried silica gel is placed at the top of a column of silica gel (diameter: 3 cm; height: 9 cm), eluting first with hexane to remove non-polar by-products and subsequently with 15% ether/hexane. The desired product elutes as a red band. Concentration of the appropriate fractions on a rotary evaporator (Note 13) and under high vacuum (0.7 mm for 10 min) affords 1.4 g (79%) of 5 as a fine red powder (Note 14).",
            "D. 2,3,3\u03b1,4-Tetrahydro-2-[(4-methylbenzene)sulfonyl]cyclopenta[c]pyrrol-5(1H)-one (6). A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed Schlenk flask, equipped with a thermometer and Teflon-coated stirring bar, is charged with 6.0 g (24.1 mmol) of enyne 3 prepared in Step B (Note 1). A 12-cm, air-cooled condenser is attached to the flask. The top of the condenser is fitted with a rubber septum, which is connected to a CO supply and the apparatus is flushed with CO through the Schlenk valve (Note 15) for several min. After the CO purge is completed, the flask is charged with 120 mL of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1,2-DME) (Note 16). Meanwhile, another 50-mL, round-bottomed Schlenk flask is charged with the Co2(CO)6-alkyne complex 5 (445 mg, 1.20 mmol, 5 mol%) (Note 9) and flushed with CO with a CO-filled balloon as described above. To the flask containing the Co2(CO)6-alkyne complex 5 are added sequentially 22.5 mL of 1,2-DME, cyclohexylamine (0.413 mL, 3.61 mmol, 15 mol%), 3 eq of amine/cobalt dimer) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH) (2.40 mL of a 0.5M solution in xylenes, 1.20 mmol, 5 mol%). The assembly is heated in an oil bath at 67\u00b0C for 15 min (Note 17), then transferred via cannula under an atmosphere of CO to the Schlenk flask containing enyne 3 (Note 18). The resulting mixture is heated at 67\u00b0C for 24 hr, when the reaction is usually complete as determined by TLC analysis (Note 19). After complete carbocyclization, the reaction mixture is transferred (in air) to a single-necked flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The dark residue is dissolved in 150 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), washed with 10% aqueous sulfuric acid (2 \u00d7 15 mL), water (15 mL), and brine (45 mL) and treated with ca. 4 g of activated carbon and anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). After 4 hr the solution is filtered through a pad of Celite (diameter: 5 cm; height: 2 cm) (Note 12) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a brown solid. Purification by flash chromatography with silica gel (Note 20) affords 5.8-6.2 g (86-93% yield) of 6 as a slightly yellow solid. Colorless microcrystalline material may be obtained by recrystallization from a cold (\u221220\u00b0C) solution of 1:1 2-propanol:CH2Cl2 (4.6-5.1 g, 69-77%) (Notes 21, 22)."

An apparatus, consisting of a 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, reflux condenser connected to a vacuum/N2 line, inlet tube sealed with a rubber septum, and magnetic stirring bar, is evacuated, then flushed with nitrogen. This cycle is repeated four times. The apparatus is flame-dried under a flow of nitrogen, then cooled to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Carbonyldihydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II), RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, (0.918 g, 1.00 mmol, 0.010 eq) (Notes 2, 3) is placed in the flask under a slow flow of nitrogen. Addition of 20 mL of toluene (Note 4) to the flask affords a suspension of white solids (Note 5). To this suspension are added triethoxyvinylsilane (20.93 g, 110 mmol, 1.10 eq) (Notes 6, 7), then 1-tetralone (14.62 g, 100 mmol, 1.00 eq) (Notes 6, 8) at room temperature through the rubber septum using a syringe. The resulting mixture containing the white solids is heated to reflux in an oil bath (oil bath temperature: 135\u00b0C) (Notes 9, 10). The reaction mixture becomes colorless within 1 min, then changes to a dark wine red color within 5 min (Note 11). After heating for 30 min, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. About half of the reaction mixture is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask (Note 12) for concentration and distillation. Volatile materials (toluene and triethoxyvinylsilane) are removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (2 mm) at 40\u00b0C. After almost all volatile materials are removed, the other half of the reaction mixture is transferred to the flask. The reaction vessel is rinsed with two 5-mL portions of toluene, then the rinses are transferred to the distillation flask. The combined reaction mixture and rinses are concentrated. Solvent and vinylsilane are removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (2 mm at 40\u00b0C) (Note 13). Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 31-32.5 g (92-96%) of 8-[2-(triethoxysilyl)ethyl]-1-tetralone as a pale yellow liquid, bp 133-135\u00b0C/0.2 mm (Notes 14-18)."

After separation of water ceases, the reaction mixture is partitioned between hexane (500 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (200 mL). The organic phase is washed with water (100 mL) and saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) (100 mL), dried over magnesium chloride (MgSO4), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue yields, after about 5 g of forerun, 249 g (97%) of the acetal 1 as a colorless oil (bp 99-100\u00b0C, 3.5 mm) (Note 2).",
            "B. 1,6,6-Trimethyl-4,8-dioxaspiro[2.5]oct-1-ene (3) (Note 3). A solution of sodium amide in liquid ammonia is prepared according to a procedure previously described (Notes 4, 5). An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen gas inlet, and dry ice/acetone condenser protected with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets. The flask is flushed with nitrogen introduced through the gas inlet, then is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath. The nitrogen source is replaced with a hose connected to a cylinder of ammonia (NH3). Gaseous NH3 is introduced to the flask condensing ca. 400 mL of NH3 and gentle stirring is started. The NH3 inlet is replaced with a glass stopper and the dry ice/acetone bath is replaced with a \u221235\u00b0C bath (electronically controlled or a dry ice/trichloroethylene bath). Crystals of Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (0.3 g) are added through the neck having a stopper. To the resulting orange solution is added a small (about 5 mm3) cube of sodium. The solution is stirred (Note 6) until the blue color disappears and fine black particles appear. Pieces of sodium (21.44 g, 0.930 mol) are then added over 35 min. After 20 min, the solution turns into a dark gray suspension with a white precipitate. The cooling bath is replaced with a dry ice/acetone bath, and the gas inlet is replaced with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of 2,2-bis-(chloromethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane 1 (63.93 g, 0.300 mol) in 150 mL of dry ether (Et2O). This solution is added dropwise to the slurry of sodium amide in liquid NH3 over 1 hr. The addition funnel is rinsed with 20 mL of dry Et2O. The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 3 hr (Note 7), then is cooled again with a dry ice/acetone bath. After 10 min, a solution of freshly distilled iodomethane (44.71 g, 0.315 mol) in 80 mL of dry Et2O is added via the addition funnel over 1 hr (Notes 8, 9); the funnel is rinsed with 20 mL of dry Et2O. After stirring for 15 min, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 1 hr. The mixture is cooled with a dry ice/acetone bath again and solid ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (20.24 g, 0.378 mol) is added in several portions over 5 min. The dry ice condenser is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The cooling bath is replaced with a water bath (ca. 30\u00b0C), and a 1:1 mixture of dry Et2O and dry pentane (400 mL) is added through the addition funnel over 10 min with vigorous stirring. The water bath temperature is maintained between 25-30\u00b0C. After evaporation of most of the ammonia (1.5 to 2 hr), the ethereal solution is filtered by suction through a pad of Hyflo Super Cel to remove the inorganic salts. The filter cake is washed three times with 80 mL of Et2O. The combined filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (30-40 mm, 25\u00b0C) (Note 10) and the residue is distilled to yield 3 as a colorless oil (32.3 g, 70%; bp 58-61\u00b0C, 6-7 mm) (Notes 11-14). While this material is adequate for use in Step C, a pure sample can be obtained by flash chromatography of the crude product followed by distillation. For 36.1 g of crude product (obtained on a 0.25 mol scale), chromatography is performed with 290 g of silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60) and Et2O:pentane (5:95) as eluent, collecting 160-mL fractions. Fractions 3-16 containing the product are combined. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure followed by vacuum distillation afforded 29.3 g of 3 in 76% yield (99% pure by GC).",

The solution of potassium tert-butoxide is added to this solution through a 1.5 mm i.d. cannula over 5 min. After stirring for 5 min at this temperature, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 17). After stirring for 4 hr (Note 18), 15 mL of 1N HCl is added in one portion. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel with the aid of 30 mL of Et2O, and the aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is washed successively with 5 mL each of saturated NaHCO3 and saturated NaCl, and is dried over Na2SO4. After concentration on a rotary evaporator, a pale yellow oil is obtained. Distillation under reduced pressure (Note 19) (57-59\u00b0C,7.3 mm) affords 36.49 g (79% yield) of 5 (Notes 19, 20) after ca. 1.5 g of a forerun.

            "A flame-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a large Teflon magnetic stirring bar and three rubber septa, is charged with 5.5 g (28.1 mmol) of (\u2212)-bornyl acetate (Note 1) in 162 mL of dichloromethane (Note 2) under an argon atmosphere. A thermocouple (Note 3) is immersed in the solution through one of the rubber septa. The flask is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath and cooled to an internal solution temperature of \u221278\u00b0C. Stirring is begun and diisobutylaluminum hydride, 54.4 mL of a 1.0M solution in hexanes (54.4 mmol, 2 eq), is added as a slow stream via a glass syringe over a period of 13 min; during this addition, the internal solution temperature does not exceed \u221272\u00b0C (Notes 1,4). The clear solution is stirred for an additional 45 min at \u221278\u00b0C, then 6.6 mL of pyridine (6.5 g, 81.6 mmol, 3.0 eq) is added dropwise via a glass syringe, maintaining the internal temperature below \u221276\u00b0C. Immediately following, a solution of 6.5 g of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (54.5 mmol, 2.0 eq) in 80 mL of dichloromethane (Note 2) is added slowly via an 18-gauge stainless steel cannula (Note 5). The internal temperature is not allowed to rise above \u221272\u00b0C during this addition. Acetic anhydride (15.4 mL, 16.6 g, 163.2 mmol, 6.0 eq) is then added dropwise via a glass syringe over 5.5 min at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below \u221272\u00b0C.\nThe resultant light yellow solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 12 hr (Note 6). During this time, the color of the solution intensifies considerably. The bright yellow solution is warmed to 0\u00b0C in an ice water bath and stirred for 35 min, during which time the color of the solution becomes bright yellow-orange. The reaction is then quenched by the sequential addition of 270 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium potassium tartrate. The emulsion is removed from the ice water bath and stirred vigorously for 50 min, by which time adequate phase separation is observed (Note 7). The biphasic mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and is extracted with four 175-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed sequentially with two 500-mL portions of an ice-cooled 1M aqueous solution of sodium bisulfate, three 500-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 8.5 g of a yellow oil.\nThe residue is purified using flash chromatography with 145 g of triethylamine-deactivated Merck 9385 silica gel 60 (230-400) (Note 8) eluting with 5% ethyl ether in hexanes (Note 9). Fractions of 50-mL are collected, and product-containing fractions are identified by TLC analysis (Note 10). The product (6.4 g, 95%) is obtained as a clear oil (Notes 11,12). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra indicate that the product is a 2.8:1 mixture of diastereomers. Short path vacuum distillation of a portion of the product afforded material of comparable purity, bp 73.5\u221275\u00b0C (2 mm)."

The resulting mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C (Note 22) for 24 h during which time a light-yellow precipitate forms and the color of the reaction mixture changes from yellow to brown. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, along with CH2Cl2 (200 mL). The solids are removed by suction filtration through a medium-porosity fritted-glass funnel and are washed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20\u201325 mmHg, water bath temperature 40\u201345 \u00b0C). Methanol (200 mL) is added to the residue and the resulting suspension is filtered, washed with methanol (3 \u00d7 75 mL) and dried in vacuo. The crude product is further purified by silica gel column chromatography (Note 3) [silica gel, 44 \u00d7 572 mm, CHCl3/CH2Cl2, 3/1 to 1/1] to afford macrocyclic product 6 as a pale-yellow solid (3.80 g, 61%) (Notes 23, 24)."

Then, a reflux condenser equipped with a bubbler filled with oil is placed on the three-necked flask and one of the side necks is stoppered. Subsequently, a nitrogen inlet is connected to the remaining neck and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min. Next, under a low flow of nitrogen, the stoppered side neck is opened and the catalyst solution is added through a funnel using 200 mL of toluene (Note 3) to rinse the flask.

After this period, N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (15.87 g, 190.0 mmol, 1.27 equiv.) is added in one portion to the reaction mixture and stirring is continued for a further 40 min at 25 \u00b0C. The reaction broth is diluted with 100 mL of methylene chloride, transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed sequentially with cold (0 \u00b0C) 1 M hydrochloric acid (300 mL) (Note 5) and saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (300 mL). The organic layer is separated, dried using sodium sulfate (40 g), filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel and concentrated to dryness in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask on a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Diethyl ether (200 mL) is added to the resulting liquid followed by 4 M HCl in dioxane (75 mL, 0.30 mol, 2 equiv.) (Note 6). After 30 minutes, the solid precipitate is collected in a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 7), washed with 100 mL of ice-cold diethyl ether and dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) for 8 h to give N-methyl-O-benzoylhydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 as a white microcrystalline solid (17.45 g, 62%) (Note 8) that is used in Step B without further purification (Note 9).",
            "B. (2-Benzoyloxy)-1,4-cyclohexanedione (mono)ethylene ketal 2. An open 25-mL single-necked round-bottomed flask (Note 10) equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged at ambient temperature with 1,4-cyclohexanedione mono-ethylene ketal (4.68 g, 30.0 mmol, 1 equiv.) (Note 11) and dimethyl sulfoxide (7.5 mL). N-Methyl-O-benzoyl-hydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 (5.63 g, 30.0 mmol, 1 equiv., as prepared above) is added to the flask over a period of 15 min (Note 12) and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h (Note 13). The solution is subsequently poured into 300 mL of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel where it is washed with 250 mL of water. The layers are separated and retained: the organic layer is washed further with two 250 mL portions of water, which are discarded; and the original aqueous layer is washed with two 100 mL portions of ethyl acetate which are added to the original organic layer. The combined organic fractions are dried using magnesium sulfate (25 g), filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to give a brown solid as a crude product (Note 14). The crude solid is transferred to a 25-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 5 mL of hot (80 \u00b0C) isopropyl alcohol, then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. The resultant solid is collected in a B\u00fcchner funnel and sequentially washed with ice-cold isopropyl alcohol (50 mL) and ice-cold 35\u201360 petroleum ether (50 mL) (Note 11) before being dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) for 8 h to yield (2-benzoyloxy)-1,4-cyclohexanedione mono-ethylene ketal 2 (Note 15) as pale yellow needles (6.38 g, 77%) (Note 16)."

            "A. Bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-phosphine oxide (2). To an oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir-bar, and fitted with a graduated 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (fitted with a septum) in the center neck, a thermocouple inserted through a rubber septum in the left neck, and an inert gas inlet valve in the right neck, is evacuated (0.03 mmHg vacuum) and backfilled three times with argon. The flask is charged with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene 1 (59.2 mL, 343 mmol, 3.3 equiv, Note 1) followed by anhydrous THF (60 mL, Note 2) through the addition funnel septum cap with a syringe. The addition funnel is then charged with isopropylmagnesium chloride (171.5 mL, 343 mmol, 3.3 equiv, 2.0 M solution in THF, Note 3) via cannula under argon pressure. The flask is then placed in a dry-ice/acetone bath. When the internal temperature reaches \u201330 \u00b0C, the solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride is added rapidly over 10 min. The internal temperature at the conclusion of the addition is \u221260 \u00b0C. Tetrahydrofuran (10 mL, added through the addition funnel septum cap with a syringe) is used to wash the walls of the addition funnel into the flask. The dry-ice/acetone bath is then replaced by an ice/H2O bath. The internal temperature rapidly rises to a maximum of 9 \u00b0C in approximately 5 min, to give a clear, brown solution, then the internal temperature rapidly falls to 2 \u00b0C (Note 4). At this time a 50 \u03bcL aliquot is removed by syringe through the septum in the left neck of the flask, and is quenched into a biphasic mixture of Et2O/2 M HCl (~ 2 mL). The aqueous layer is removed and the organic solution is back extracted with H2O (1 mL). The organic layer is filtered through a SiO2 plug (1 mm \u00d7 2 cm), which is eluted with Et2O (~2 mL). The filtrate is analyzed by gas chromatography to monitor reaction progress (Notes 5 and 6). An additional portion of isopropylmagnesium chloride solution (5 mL, 10 mmol, 3% of the original Grignard charge) is added at once by syringe at 1 \u00b0C through the septum in the left neck of the flask. After an additional 0.5 h, GC analysis of a quenched aliquot indicates that Grignard exchange is complete (total reaction time 1 h after the initial exotherm).\nThe addition funnel is then charged with THF (30 mL) followed by diethyl phosphite (13.7 mL, 104 mmol, 1 equiv, Note 7) through the septum cap with a syringe. The reaction solution is again cooled in a dry-ice/acetone bath. When the internal temperature reaches \u201360 \u00b0C, the phosphite solution is added drop-wise over 10 min, causing the internal temperature to rise to \u201350 \u00b0C. The cold bath is removed, and the reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature (~18\u201320 \u00b0C). After one hour at ambient temperature, GC analysis of a quenched aliquot indicates the reaction is complete to give phosphine oxide 2 (tR = 6.90 min, GC Method 2). The reaction mixture is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C internal temperature in an ice/H2O bath, and 3 N HCl (175 mL) is added by addition funnel over 15 min. The addition funnel is removed and saturated aqueous NaCl solution (150 mL) is then added at once. Then EtOAc (250 mL) is added and the biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is back-extracted with EtOAc (250 mL). The combined organic extracts are then dried (MgSO4, 50 g, Note 8), filtered into a 1-L round-bottomed flask and the solvent is removed with rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue is further dried under high vacuum (0.02 mmHg, 15 min) to remove the 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene by-product (Note 9). The resulting orange-brown solid is dissolved in boiling MTBE (90 \u2013 110 mL) in a 1-L round-bottomed flask, equipped a magnetic stir-bar, and a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with an argon adaptor at the top. The contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature under argon, with stirring, causing a thick, brown slurry to form (Note 10). Hexanes (140 mL) are added over 10 min to this slurry through the addition funnel (Note 11). The mixture is then stirred for an additional 10 min to break up any large solids, and the mixture is filtered through a medium-fritted filter funnel, washing the flask and filter cake with MTBE (5 mL). The solid is dried under a vigorous stream of argon, from an inverted funnel, flowing over the filter cake. After 2 h, compound 2 (36.0\u201337.1 g, 73\u201375%) is obtained as a powdery, white solid (Note 12).",
            "B. Bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine (3). A 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stir-bar is fitted with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (fitted with a rubber septum) in the center neck, a thermocouple through a rubber septum in the left neck, and an inert gas valve in the right neck. Phosphine oxide 2 (10.0 g, 21.0 mmol, 1 equiv) is added under a flow of argon by removal of the inert gas valve. After replacement of the inert gas valve, MTBE (50 mL, Note 13) is added via syringe to the flask through the septum on the addition funnel. The resulting slurry is stirred under argon at ambient temperature for 5 min. The addition funnel is then charged with DIBAL-H (42.2 mL, 42.2 mmol, 1.0 M solution in cyclohexane, 2 equiv, Note 14). This solution is then added drop-wise to the substrate slurry over 10 min. The internal temperature rises to a maximum temperature of 36 \u00b0C and a brown solution forms (Fig. 1). The addition funnel is rinsed with MTBE (5 mL). The resulting mixture is then stirred for 1 h, and then is placed in a dry-ice/acetone bath. A needle connected to an argon source is inserted through the flask septum and positioned beneath the solution surface, so that a slow stream of argon is bubbled through the solution (Note 15). The addition funnel is charged with an aqueous 2 N NaOH solution (80 mL). This solution is added drop-wise to the reaction mixture over ~ 15 min. The internal temperature rises to \u201327 \u00b0C during the addition (Note 16). The cold bath is replaced by a water bath (30\u201335 \u00b0C) to raise the internal temperature to approximately 20 \u00b0C, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min at this temperature (Note 17). Stirring is stopped, and two clear phases are observed (See Fig. 2). A 32-cm, 18-gauge needle attached to a 60-mL polyethylene syringe is inserted through the flask septum with the needle tip pressed against the bottom of the flask. The lower (aqueous) phase is removed by syringe and discarded as waste. The addition funnel is charged with H2O (40 mL) by syringe through the addition funnel septum cap and added to the reaction flask by slow addition over approximately 5 min. The mixture is stirred for 5 min, then the lower (aqueous) phase is removed by syringe through flask septum and discarded as waste, leaving the solution of crude secondary phosphine 3 in the reaction flask.\nAn Airfree filter is charged with Merck silica gel 60 (32 g) followed by anhydrous MgSO4 (28 g), and topped with sand (30 g) (Note 18, see Fig. 1). The filter is then sealed with a rubber septum that is further secured with a piece of copper wire. The bottom of the Airfree filter is connected to a vacuum take-off adapter (Note 19), which in turn is connected to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask used as receiver. The side arm of the vacuum take-off adapter is connected with a short piece of rubber tubing to a Florence flask cold trap (Note 20) that is cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C in a dry-ice/acetone bath to collect the evaporated organic solvents. The cold trap is vented to an argon bubbler. All joints of the Airfree filter apparatus are greased with Dow silicon grease (Note 21). A mixture of cyclohexane/MTBE (5:1, 100 mL) is then injected by syringe through the septum cap of the Airfree funnel containing the silica gel/MgSO4 column. A slight argon pressure is applied from the upper valve of the Airfree filter, and the solvent is passed through to wet the solids. The receiver flask is removed and the wash solvent discarded as waste. A new, oven-dried, 500-mL one-necked receiver flask is then installed, and argon is purged gently through the system for approximately 5 min. The organic phase from the reaction flask containing the crude secondary phosphine is removed by syringe and injected through the septum cap of the Airfree filter onto the column (see Fig. 3). At the same time, a cyclohexane/MTBE mixture (5:1, 100 mL) is charged to the reaction flask by syringe (Notes 15, 22). A slight positive pressure of argon is applied to the upper valve of the Airfree filter as before, slowly flowing the secondary phosphine solution through the column. Then, 100 mL of the solvent mixture is injected through the septum cap of the Airfree filter and is passed through the solids under a slight argon pressure to wash the remaining column contents into the receiver flask. The entire product is now contained in the 500-mL receiver flask (Fig. 4, Note 23).\nThe receiver flask is placed in a warm water bath (32 \u2013 40 \u00b0C) (Note 24). The rate of argon flow through the Airfree filter side arm is then increased, causing the solvents to be removed from the secondary phosphine product by evaporation, with solvent condensation in the attached cold trap (Note 25). After approximately 8 h, all the solvent is removed and the product secondary phosphine 3 (7.7\u20137.8 g, 79\u201383% yield) is obtained as a white crystalline solid in the receiver (Fig. 5, Note 26).\nThe secondary phosphine can be recrystallized by working in a dry box. The solid is transferred to a one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir-bar, and a septum-sealed, Teflon-taped three-way adaptor. The flask is removed from the dry-box and the adaptor is attached to an argon inert gas line. A 20-gauge needle is inserted through the septum as a vent, then degassed MeOH (18 mL) is added via syringe. The contents are then magnetically stirred and heated with a heat gun until all the solids dissolved. The needle is removed and the flask is isolated from the septum by turning the three-way stopcock. The contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature. When the contents became turbid (Fig. 6), the flask is placed in an ice bath for 1 h. While still in the ice-bath, the mother-liquor is cannula-transferred to another septum-sealed, one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask that is purged three times with argon. The crystals remaining are washed with chilled (0 \u00b0C) degassed MeOH (5 mL) and the wash is transferred to the flask containing the mother liquor. The crystals are further dried under reduced pressure (0.03 mmHg) for 30 min and then are transferred to the dry-box for isolation (crop 1, 6.0\u20136.3 g, 61\u201364%). The flask containing the mother liquor is transferred to the dry-box and placed in a \u201320 \u00b0C freezer for 12 h. A second crop is collected by vacuum filtration in the dry box to give 0.90\u20130.36 g (combined crops 6.7\u20136.9 g, 68\u201370%) of 3 as colorless needles (Note 27)."

To a solution of methyl bromoacetate (1) (51.5 mL, 0.528 mol) in MeOH (86 mL) in a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser, a drying tube, a septum through which is passed a metal temperature probe and a 20 \u00b0C water bath is added a slurry of sodium azide (42.3 g, 0.649 mol, 1.23 equiv) in H2O (40 mL) via a funnel in one portion. The residual sodium azide is rinsed into the round-bottomed flask with water (2 \u00d7 6 mL). The suspension is stirred for 20 min in the water bath and a mild exotherm occurs (Note 2). The solution is then brought to gentle reflux with a heating mantle for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent is removed carefully on the rotary evaporator (40 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C water bath), as the heterogeneous mixture has a tendency to bump. The residue is partitioned between Et2O (100 mL) and H2O (100 mL), transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous phase is further extracted with of Et2O (3 \u00d7 30 mL). The combined organic layer is dried with MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to give methyl azidoacetate (53.9\u201354.5 g, 89\u201390%) as a slightly yellow oil.",
            "B. Methyl (2Z)-2-azido-3-(2-chloropyridin-3-yl)acrylate (4). This reaction should be performed behind a safety shield. A 2-L three-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40 ground glass joints) is fitted with a drying tube, a 125-mL addition funnel, a magnetic stir bar (Note 3), and a septum through which is passed a metal temperature probe. To the flask is added 2-chloro-3-pyridine carboxaldehyde (20.0 g, 141 mmol) (Note 1), MeOH (200 mL), and methyl azidoacetate (32 mL, 349 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 4). A slightly positive pressure of nitrogen is placed on the system via a needle through the septum. The flask is placed in an acetone bath, and dry ice is added slowly to the bath until the internal temperature reaches \u221210 to \u221212 \u00b0C (Note 5). At that point, a 25% solution of NaOMe in MeOH (80 mL, 4.37 M, 349 mmol, 2.5 equiv) is slowly added using the addition funnel over a period of 25 to 30 min. Dry ice is occasionally added to the cold bath during this time to maintain the internal temperature at approximately \u22129 to \u221212 \u00b0C. The reaction color changes from clear pale brown to cloudy orange/yellow as the addition proceeds, and mild bubbling is noted. When the addition is completed, the mixture is stirred an additional 15 min at \u221210 \u00b0C. The flask is then transferred to an ice bath, and stirring is continued for 2.5 h, during which time the internal temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 \u00b0C (Note 6). A tan-colored precipitate gradually forms (product), and slow bubbling is observed. The reaction is then placed in an ice bath in a 4 \u00b0C cold room, and is stirred overnight (16 h) with the drying tube in place. The flask is covered in aluminum foil to exclude light. The next morning, a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask is placed in an ice bath and the flask is then charged with 500 g of ice and 1.5 L of saturated NH4Cl solution. A stir bar is transferred to the Erlenmeyer flask, and the tan-colored suspension is poured onto the stirring mixture over approximately 20 sec. The reaction flask is rinsed with 3 \u00d7 50 mL of ice water to ensure that any remaining solid is transferred. The final pH of the suspension is approximately 7.5. After stirring for an additional 5 min, the product is collected on a 12-cm B\u00fcchner funnel using a standard vacuum filtration setup, washing with ice-cold water (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 7). The tan-colored solid is air-dried for 10 min on the B\u00fcchner funnel under suction from an aspirator, and is then transferred to a 1-L single-necked round-bottomed flask and placed under high vacuum for 30 min. Dichloromethane (250 mL) is then added to dissolve the product, and MgSO4 (approximately 3\u20134 g) is added to dry the solution. The pale brown solution is filtered through a 2-cm thick pad of silica gel 60 on a 4-cm sintered glass funnel, which removes some dark brown baseline material. The pale yellow solution is concentrated to dryness on the rotary-evaporator (approximately 15 mmHg) at 25 \u00b0C to give the product as a pale yellow solid (17.7\u201318.8 g, 53\u201356%) (Note 8).",

The reaction mixture is stirred while being heated in an oil bath at 185 \u00b0C (Note 9), and after approximately 3 min, the starting material dissolves. At 5 min, bubbling occurs for several min as N2 is extruded from 4. After 30 min, the mixture is gently refluxing, which is maintained for 1 h. The clear deep yellow solution is then allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h, during which time a thick pale yellow precipitate forms. After cooling to 0 \u00b0C for 1 h, the product is collected on a 12\u2013cm B\u00fcchner funnel, washing with 4 \u00d7 50 mL of cold hexanes.

In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a N2 inlet, two septa and a magnetic stirring bar is introduced successively CH2Cl2 (180 mL) (Note 1) and an aqueous glyoxal solution (9.40 mL, 82.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) by syringe through one of the septa. One septum is temporarily removed and solid magnesium sulfate (40.0 g) (Note 3) is then added portion-wise over 20 min, while the mixture is stirred at room temperature. The resulting suspension is stirred for an additional 10 min, and then (R)-(+)-phenylethylamine (21.0 mL, 20.0 g, 165.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 4) is introduced dropwise via syringe over a 5 min period. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. Magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and rinsed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation and then further dried under high vacuum for 1 h (Note 5) to provide crude bis-imine (1) (Note 6) as an orange oil (21.3 g, 98.0%), which is used directly for the next step without further purification. Into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 7) equipped with one low temperature thermometer, one N2 inlet and one septum is introduced crude bis-imine 1 (21.3 g) as a solution in Et2O (300 mL) by syringe (Note 8). This solution is cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C (dry ice-acetone bath), and PhMgCl (162 mL, 2.0 M in THF, 325 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 9) is added drop-wise via syringe pump (Note 10) while maintaining the internal temperature between \u221278 \u00b0C and \u221275 \u00b0C over 2 h (Note 11). The resulting dark brown mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature gradually over 4 h, and stirred for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The mixture is then cooled to 4 \u00b0C (ice/water bath), and carefully quenched by the addition of a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (200 mL) after removal of the septum over 30 min. The solid that is formed is dissolved by the addition of de-ionized water (100 mL), and the two phases are separated in a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is then further extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (50.0 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (30 g, 5 min) and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation and further dried under high vacuum for 1 h. The crude product (33.5 g) is purified by flash column chromatography. Thus, the crude brown solid is dissolved in the minimum amount of CH2Cl2 (approximately 10 mL), charged on a column (8 \u00d7 16 cm) containing 400 g of silica gel (Note 12) and eluted with Et2O-petroleum ether (5:95, 2 L, then 10:90, 2 L). After the first apolar impurity (this spot is only evident by UV), the title compound elutes, before a mixture of other isomers (Note 13).

This solid is dissolved in boiling petroleum ether (250 mL), with addition of a small amount of CH2Cl2 (5 mL) to complete the dissolution. The solvent is allowed to evaporate to 1/5 of the initial volume at room temperature over 2 days, allowing the crystallisation to occur (Note 14). These crystals are collected by filtration, and rinsed with a small amount (15.0 mL) of cold (0 \u00b0C) petroleum ether. Thus, 13.8\u201314.7 g (40\u201343%) of pure diamine 2 are obtained (Note 15).",
            "B. (3aS,7aR)-2-[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-ethyl]-hexahydro-isoindole-1,3-dione (3). Into a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a septum and a magnetic stirring bar, containing cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride (8.50 g, 55.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 16) is added glacial acetic acid (100 mL), followed by 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamine (10.1 g, 55.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 17). The septum is removed and the flask is equipped with a Liebig condenser. The reaction is then heated at reflux (oil bath temperature 120 \u00b0C) for 13 h. The resulting mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and poured into a 1-L beaker containing 400 mL of de-ionized water. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic phases are transferred into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, cooled to 4 \u00b0C (water/ice bath) and neutralized by the slow addition (30 min) of a saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (150 mL) under vigorous stirring. After the addition is finished, the two phases are separated and the organic phase is further washed with saturated aqueous Na2CO3 (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic phase is then dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (20.0 g, 5 min). After removal of the solid by filtration, the organic phase is concentrated by rotary evaporation and further dried under high vacuum for 1 h. The resulting yellow solid is recrystallized from boiling light petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (100 mL:25 mL). Crystallization is allowed to occur at room temperature over 2 h, then at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) petroleum ether (25 mL) to give 14.2 g (81%) (Note 18) of the title compound 3 (Note 19).",

The resulting pink solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (23 \u00b0C) by removing the cooling bath, and then stirred at this temperature for 30 min (Note 22). This solution is then cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C and transferred over 2 h via cannula into a 250-mL two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with one septum and one low temperature thermometer containing a solution of imide 3 (6.00 g, 18.9 mmol) in THF (80 mL) while maintaining the internal temperature at \u221278 \u00b0C. The resulting mixture is then stirred for 1 h at \u221278 \u00b0C. A solution of methyl cyanoformate (3.00 mL, 37.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 23) in THF (10 mL) is then added dropwise via cannula over 15 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for 1 h at \u221278 \u00b0C, then the cooling bath is removed, and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (80.0 mL) is added slowly, followed by de-ionized water (20 mL).

A single-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and connected by a three-way stopcock fitted with a rubber septum to a vacuum-argon manifold, is flame-dried under vacuum (0.3 mm Hg), then is flushed with dry argon. THF (90 mL) is added via syringe to the addition funnel, followed by trimethyl borate (10.0 mL, 89.2 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 1). After the addition of the trimethyl borate to the round-bottomed flask, additional THF (30 mL) (Note 1) is added via syringe to rinse the addition funnel. The solution is then cooled in a dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath. Phenethylmagnesium chloride (60.0 mL of a 1.0 M solution in THF, 60.0 mmol) (Note 2) is then added dropwise over 1 h via the addition funnel. The mixture is stirred in the dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath for 1.5 h, then is allowed to warm to room temperature over 1 h. The resulting white slurry is then cooled in an ice/water bath and methanol (60 mL) (Note 3) is charged into the addition funnel by syringe. The methanol is added over 15 min to dilute the slurry (Note 4). The argon inlet is removed and a solution of potassium hydrogen fluoride (80.0 mL of 4.5 M aqueous solution, 360 mmol, 6.0 equiv) (Note 5) is then charged into the addition funnel and is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred for 1 h in the ice/water bath, and then is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (60 \u00b0C water bath, 9 mm Hg). The resulting white solids are placed on a high-vacuum line (0.3 mm Hg) for 36 h until the solids appear dry (Note 6). Acetone (120 mL) (Note 7) is added and the solids are broken up into a fine powder with a spatula. The suspension is then placed on a rotary evaporator and heated (40 \u00b0C) with rotation under atmospheric pressure for 5\u201310 min and filtered over a 14 g pad of Celite in a glass-fritted filter funnel. Acetone (120 mL) is added to the solid remaining in the flask, the suspension is placed on a rotary evaporator and heated (40 \u00b0C) with rotation under atmospheric pressure for 5\u201310 min and filtered over the same Celite pad. This process is repeated one additional time (Note 8). The combined filtrates are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (60 \u00b0C water bath) to a white solid, which is dissolved in a minimal amount of dry acetone (~25 mL). Diethyl ether (30 mL) is then added to precipitate the product. The white slurry is allowed to cool first to 23 \u00b0C, and then is cooled in an ice/water bath for 15 min. The slurry is placed in a refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) for 1 h, and is then filtered to give 9.84 g (77%) of a white solid (Note 9).",

The residue is treated with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) and diethyl ether (400 mL) and the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and vigorously shaken. The aqueous layer is drained and the organic layer is washed with saturated ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) and then is dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (5 g) (Note 22). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (11 mmHg, room temperature) to give a dark-red oil. The oil is then adsorbed onto 50 g of silica gel, which is then placed at the top of a packed column of silica gel (350 g) (Note 23). The column is eluted with pentanes/diethyl ether, 12:1. The red fractions containing the product are collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation at room temperature to afford 9.3\u20139.7 g (77\u201380%) of 1 as a red solid (Note 24).",

            "A. Dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1). A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal thermometer, two rubber septa and a 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar (Note 1) is charged with phenylacetylene (6.37 mL, 58.0 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2) via syringe, 60 mL of THF (Note 3) via syringe, and the solution was cooled to an internal temperature of -70 \u00b0C or colder in a dry ice/acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (1.58 M, 30.8 mL, 48.7 mmol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min directly into the stirring solution of phenylacetylene, such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. The acetone/dry ice bath is replaced with an ice/water bath. When the reaction temperature reaches approximately \u22125 \u00b0C, dichlorodimethylsilane (2.80 mL, 23.2 mmol) (Note 5) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min, such that the internal temperature does not exceed 10 \u00b0C. The ice bath is removed, the solution is allowed to stir at room temperature for 10 min (Note 6), and then the reaction mixture is poured slowly through an open joint into a 1-L round bottom flask containing a rapidly stirring solution of half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (200 mL) (Note 7). The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (5 g, Note 8), filtered through Celite 545 (Note 9), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg). The residue is then concentrated further at 1.5 mmHg for 4 h whereupon the residue solidifies (Note 10). The yellow-white solid is dissolved in a minimal amount of boiling hexanes (Note 11), and then is cooled in a freezer (\u221230 \u00b0C) for 16 h to afford the pure product as white needles that are collected by vacuum filtration (5.63 g, 93% yield) (Notes 12 and 13).",
            "B. 2,5-Dibromo-1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilole (2). From this point forward the light sensitivity of some compounds necessitates that certain flasks be wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two rubber septa, an internal thermometer, and 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar. Under a stream of argon (introduced through a septum with a syringe needle and balloon), lithium wire (0.53 g, 75.6 mmol, 4.5 equiv) (Note 14) is cut into (20-25) small pieces and washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 10 mL) to remove the protective oil. One septum is temporarily removed and a funnel is used to aid in the addition of the lithium pieces. The flask is then fitted with a gas adapter and evacuated (1.5 mmHg) for 10 min to ensure that all toluene is removed. The gas adapter is removed and naphthalene (10.12 g, 79.0 mmol, 4.7 equiv) (Note 15) is added with the aid of a funnel. The original septum is replaced and 50 mL of THF (Note 3) is added via syringe. The flask is sonicated for 1 h to facilitate dissolution of the lithium wire (Note 16), and the resulting dark green solution is left to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The lithium naphthalenide solution thus obtained is titrated according to a literature method3 and found to be 1.35-1.45 M (Note 17), and the flask is wrapped in foil.\nInto a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1) (4.37 g, 16.8 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon) is added 120 mL of THF via syringe (Note 3). The resulting silane solution is added to the lithium naphthalenide dropwise, over a minimum of 20 min, via cannula (Note 18). Once the addition is complete, the solution is cooled to -10 \u00b0C using an acetone bath with a small amount of dry ice.\nMeanwhile, a solution of anhydrous ZnCl2 (11.45 g, 84.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 19) in 70 mL of THF added via syringe (Notes 3 and 20) is prepared in a 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm stir bar and rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The ZnCl2 solution is added to the naphthalenide/silane mixture via cannula over a minimum of 20 min (Note 21). The acetone/dry ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 22).\nMeanwhile, a 1-L, three-necked, foil-wrapped, round-bottomed flask is charged with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 7.45 g, 41.9 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 23) and equipped with an internal thermometer, 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar and two rubber septa (one pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The flask is charged with 35 mL of THF via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C or colder using a dry ice/acetone bath. The room temperature silane solution is added into the cold NBS solution via cannula such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is stirred for a further 30 min at -70 \u00b0C or colder. One septum is removed and the cold mixture is slowly poured into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 300-mL solution of rapidly stirring half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (Notes 7 and 24). The heterogeneous mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 mL of half-saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 (Note 25), 200 mL of water, 200 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (7 g) and quickly filtered through a thin pad of silica (Note 26) into a foil wrapped 500-mL single-necked flask. The yellow solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and then at 1.5 mmHg for 1 h to give approximately 17 g of crude material (quantitative mass recovery based on both naphthalene and dibromosilole 2). 1H NMR analysis of a representative sample typically shows a 1:5.2 mixture of the dibromosilole (2) and naphthalene (Note 27), which corresponds to a 96% yield (6.78 g) of useable dibromosilole (2). It is generally unnecessary to remove the naphthalene for subsequent use, such as cross coupling reactions.\nIf necessary, the naphthalene can be removed by sublimation in small batches. Thus, 1.7 g of the naphthalene-silole mixture is ground into powder using a mortar and pestle, and sublimed in the dark, under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 3-4 hours at 35 \u00b0C (Note 28). This will typically remove 99% of the naphthalene according to 1H NMR analysis. If desired, further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the residual material from the combined sublimations in hot hexanes (160 mL) followed by cooling in a freezer for 16 h. The pure 2,5-dibromosilole crystallizes as white needles, which are vacuum-filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice cold hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 6.64 g (95% yield) of 2. (Note 29, 30 and 31). Dibromosilole 2 stored in the dark at room temperature is stable for several weeks. Even brief exposure to sunlight during processing will lead to significant decomposition (Notes 24 and 30)."

After complete addition, the cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture is then stirred for about two hours to allow completion of the reaction (Note 7). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath and then is quenched by dropwise addition of water (150 mL) via syringe while keeping the temperature below 15 \u00b0C (Note 8). The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel where the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed twice with water (150 mL each) and then is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (approximately 5 g).

Butyllithium (40.6 mL, 95.8 mmol, 2.36 M, 2.70 equiv, Note 3) is added to the THF solution of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene over 10 min via syringe as the mixture was kept at 0 \u00b0C. After 5 min, the colorless solution of the lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide is removed from the ice-bath and allowed to warm to ambient temperature and kept at this temperature for an additional 40 min. During this time, another flame-dried, 300-mL, single-neck round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2.5-cm football-shaped stir bar, charged with solid copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (19.71 g, 95.84 mmol, 2.700 equiv, Note 2), sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. The flask containing copper bromide is charged with tetrahydrofuran (80 mL, Note 1) and the mixture is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature). The lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide solution at ambient temperature is slowly transferred via cannula over 5 min to the cold (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature) flask containing copper bromide. The bright-yellow solution is maintained at \u221278 \u00b0C for an additional 5 min. The flask containing the yellow copper acetylide solution is moved from the dry ice-acetone bath to an ice-water bath and maintained for 20 min prior to use.\nA flame-dried, 500-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2.5-cm stir bar is charged with benzanilide (1, 7.00 g, 35.5 mmol, 1 equiv, Note 2), sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. Anhydrous dichloromethane (71 mL, Note 1) followed by 2-chloropyridine (13.4 mL, 16.1 g, 142 mmol, 4.00 equiv, Note 4) are added via syringe and the heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred and cooled by placement in a dry ice-acetone bath (\u221278 \u00b0C, external temperature). After 10 min, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf2O, 7.03 mL, 12.0 g, 42.6 mmol, 1.20 equiv, Note 2) is added via syringe over 2 min. After five min, the reaction flask is moved to an ice-water bath for a period of five min, and then returned to the dry ice-acetone bath. After five min, the copper (trimethylsilyl)acetylide solution prepared above is transferred via cannula over 5 min to the cold (\u221278 \u00b0C) solution of the activated amide and the reaction mixture is kept in a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 5). After five min, the reaction flask is moved from the dry ice-acetone bath to an ice-water bath. After five min, the cold bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. After 20 min, the reaction mixture is filtered through Celite into a 500-mL, side-armed Erlenmeyer flask with vacuum filtration (Note 6). The combined filtrate is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 70 mmHg). The remaining brown oil is purified by flash column chromatography (Note 7) to afford 8.99 g (91%) (Note 8) of imine 2 as a bright yellow oil (Note 9)."

Mesitylene (20.9 mL, 18.03 g, 150 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) and cinnamyl alcohol (19.7 mL, 20.57 g, 153 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added via syringe (Note 6). The flask is then fitted with a rubber septum and placed on a magnetic stir plate. After stirring for 5 min, Pd(OAc)2 (0.067 g, 0.300 mmol, 0.002 equiv) (Note 7), and 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (0.190 g, 0.330 mmol, 0.0022 equiv) (Note 8) are added by temporarily removing the septum. Material adhering to the sides of the reaction flask is rinsed into the reaction mixture with 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, resulting in a clear, brown solution. Stirring is maintained and the reaction flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter fitted with a reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a thermocouple temperature probe adapter. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the system is placed in a heating mantle filled with sand (Note 9) and the thermocouple is inserted through the adapter. The solution is heated at 85 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 7 h (Notes 10, 11). Heating and stirring are then interrupted, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (Notes 12, 13). After removing the nitrogen inlet and the water condenser, the reaction mixture is concentrated for 1 h by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg). The residue is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) and treated with activated charcoal (3.0 g) (Note 14). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 30 min and filtered in vacuo through a Celite pad (Note 15) in a B\u00fcchner funnel. The Celite is carefully washed with three 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate (Note 16) and the combined washings are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with aqueous HCl (2 M, 250 mL) (Note 17) and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 125 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with 200 mL of brine, then are retreated with charcoal (1.0 g) and MgSO4 (20 g) (Notes 18, 19), then are filtered through a second Celite pad in a B\u00fcchner funnel (Notes 15, 20), and concentrated under reduced pressure (45 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow solid (around 26 g, 95% yield) (Note 21) is dissolved in 80 mL of hot dichloromethane (35-38 \u00b0C), and about 140 mL of hexane (38 \u00b0C) is added until a light-yellow, homogeneous solution is obtained. The solution is cooled at \u221215 \u00b0C for 2 h and the resulting white crystals (21.8 g) are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (45 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg) and the residue is dissolved in 20 mL of dichloromethane (35 \u00b0C), and 30 mL of hexane (35 \u00b0C). The solution is cooled at -15 \u00b0C overnight and a second crop of crystals is collected by suction filtration, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (20 mL). The two crops of crystals are combined and dried overnight at 0.1 mmHg to provide 23.2 g of cinnamyl-H-phosphinic acid (83%) as white crystals (Note 22)."

            "B. 1-Trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one. A 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, adapter with internal temperature probe, reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a septum with nitrogen outlet is purged with nitrogen, then charged with 2-propanol (350 mL, Note 3) and nitrogen is bubbled through the solvent for 15 min via a 30-cm, 18 gauge needle. The mechanical stirrer, fitted with a 60 X 20 mm Teflon paddle, is started at 120\u2013150 rpm. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one (29.9 g, 112 mmol) is dissolved in 50 mL of 2-propanol (gentle heating is required) and added to the reaction flask, rinsing with an additional 50 mL, then 20 mL of 2-propanol. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the solution for 15 min. The septum is removed and replaced with a glass funnel, through which 10% Pd/C (5.98 g, 50% w/w in water) is added, the septum is replaced, and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The septum is removed again, replaced with a glass funnel, and sodium formate is added in a single portion (38.1 g, 559 mmol, 5.0 equiv, Note 3), rinsing with 25 mL of 2-propanol The septum is replaced and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The flask is heated in an oil bath to an internal temperature of 80 \u00b0C, and is maintained at this temperature with stirring for 18 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and a 60-\u03bcL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 \u03bcL of ether. A 4-\u03bcL sample of this solution is analyzed by GC (Note 4), and shows complete conversion. The slurry is filtered with suction through a pad of Celite (8 cm diameter sintered glass funnel, 350 mL volume, with a 4 cm pad of Celite), into a 1-L filter flask rinsing with four 50-mL portions of 2-propanol. The filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to a cloudy, yellow oil, which is then diluted with 150 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, Note 3) and then is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with three portions of half-saturated brine (75 mL each), once with saturated brine, then is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a clear, orange oil (17.2 g, 86.7 mmol, 77% yield) (Note 8) with traces of MTBE and 2-propanol. This material is used without further purification in the next reaction.",
            "C. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione. A three-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal temperature probe, 50-mL addition funnel with nitrogen inlet, a septum with nitrogen outlet and magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen and charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]-heptan-6-one (17.1 g, 81.0 mmol) and 33 mL each of 2-propanol and water. The solution is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with an ice-water bath, and 26 mL of 2:1 water-acetic acid (v/v) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 30 min. At this rate of addition, the internal temperature remains below 5 \u00b0C throughout the addition. The solution is then allowed to stir for 16 h and gradually come to room temperature. A 60-\u03bcL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 \u03bcL of ether from which a 4-\u03bcL sample is used for GC analysis (Note 4), which shows complete conversion to cycloheptane-1,3-dione. The reaction mixture is poured into 200 mL of MTBE in a 500-mL separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with an additional 100 mL of MTBE. The organic solutions are combined, washed with 50 mL of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration through cotton, rinsing with 50 mL MTBE and concentration on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C water bath) provides the crude product as a clear, amber oil. 1H NMR analysis shows the diketone contaminated with residual MTBE and acetic acid. The oil is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, and treated with 22.5 g of silica gel (Note 6). Concentration on the rotary evaporator provides a tan, free-flowing solid, which is placed on the top of a 7.5 \u00d7 23 cm column of silica gel packed as a slurry in hexane/Et2O, 2:1. The column is eluted with hexane/Et2O, 2:1 (500 mL) and 1:1 (3.8 L), followed by combination of the product-containing fractions (TLC in hexane/Et2O, 1:1, visualization with p-anisaldehyde stain). The combined fractions are concentrated via rotary evaporator, under vacuum (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide cycloheptane-1,3-dione as a clear, pale-yellow oil (6.69 g, 53.1 mmol, 61% yield). This material is approximately 95% pure as determined by 1H NMR analysis and is suitable for most subsequent uses, although the chromatographed material fails combustion analysis. If necessary, further purification can be achieved by short path vacuum distillation (Notes 9, 10, and 11)."

A flame-dried, two-necked, 50-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with septa to prevent exposure to air. Needles are then used for both an argon inlet and gas outlet to a bubbler. To this flask is added Rh2(OAc)4 (47.4 mg, 0.214 mmol Rh, 0.2 mol%) (Note 1) followed by 2-bromopropene (18.5 mL, 25.2 g, 0.208 mol, 2.18 equiv) (Note 2) by syringe. The argon inlet is removed and ethyl diazoacetate (11.0 mL, 10.6 g, 92.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) is added by syringe pump over a period of two days (Note 4). Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 8 h (Note 5). The gas outlet is then removed and one septum is replaced with a one-piece, vacuum-jacketed short path distillation head containing an 18 mm (length) \u00d7 13 mm (OD) Vigreaux column. The excess 2-bromopropene is removed by distillation (760 mmHg, bp 42-45 \u00b0C) (Note 6). The reaction flask is cooled to room temperature, vacuum is applied (18\u201322 mmHg), and the flask is gradually heated in an oil bath to a bath temperature of 80 \u00b0C. This distillation provides 15.3-18.0 g (80-94% yield) of the bromo ester 1 (bp 64\u201373 \u00b0C, 18\u201322 mmHg) as a clear, colorless liquid (Notes 7\u20139).",

A flame-dried, two-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a septum and a condenser containing a septum. An argon inlet and gas outlet is introduced through the condenser septa using needles. Under argon atmosphere, sodium hydride (6.10 g, 0.153 mol, 1.77 equiv) (Note 10) and diethyl ether (110 mL) (Note 11) are added. Bromo ester 1 (17.9 g, 0.0864 mol, 1.00 equiv) is then added via cannula using 10 mL of diethyl ether to complete the transfer. The argon inlet needle is removed, leaving the reaction solution vented to a bubbler. The reaction mixture is brought to reflux (oil bath set to 45 \u00b0C) before ethanol (1.1 mL, 0.019 mol, 0.22 equiv) (Note 12) is added (CAUTION: addition of the ethanol should be done slowly over the course of several minutes to prevent excessive hydrogen gas evolution). The resulting, light-brown solution is stirred at reflux for 15 h (reaction progress can be monitored by GC-MS, Note 13). The reaction mixture is then cooled and the precipitated tan solid is filtered through a 1 cm pad of Celite\u00ae in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (8.5 cm ID). The residue is washed with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and the resulting yellow filtrate is distilled at 760 mmHg using a 12 cm (length) \u00d7 17 mm OD Vigreaux column and short path distillation apparatus (18 mm (length) \u00d7 13 mm (OD)) to remove the diethyl ether. Vacuum is then applied (13\u201314 mmHg) and the resulting yellow oil residue is then distilled to afford 7.75 g (71% yield) of 2-methylenecyclopropane carboxylic acid ethyl ester (2) (40\u201344 \u00b0C, 13\u201314 mmHg) as a clear, colorless liquid. A second distillation (Note 14), necessary to remove a trace impurity, is performed to provide 7.28 g (66% yield) of analytically pure product (Note 15)."

The solvent is then removed in vacuo at 0.01 mmHg, the residue is re-dissolved in hexanes (50 mL), and precipitation of LiCl is observed. The suspension is transferred to a flame-dried, 100-mL centrifuge vessel via cannula (Note 1), and is separated from the precipitated LiCl by centrifugation (7 min, 28,000 rpm). A suitable alternative to centrifugation is Schlenk filtration or any other technique that allows manipulation under inert atmosphere. Finally, the hexane supernatant is removed by cannula into a flame-dried, 100-mL Schlenk tube (Note 1).

An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 200-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel (placed in the central neck of the flask and fitted with a rubber septum) and a 3.2 cm \u00d7 1.6 cm, egg shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with sodium borohydride (30.0 g, 0.793 mol, 2.4 equiv) (Note 1) and 500 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The resulting suspension is cooled in an ice bath and stirred rapidly. The pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a previously prepared solution of iodine (83.9 g, 0.331 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) in 150 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The iodine-THF solution is added dropwise to the borohydride-THF suspension over 1.5 h (Note 4). Once addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted to the central neck of the flask. (S)-Phenylglycine (50.0 g, 0.331 mol) (Note 5) is then added to the mixture in small portions (Note 6). After the (S)-phenylglycine has been added, the ice-bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 18 h (Note 7). After this period, the solution removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-bath for 20 min, then 60 mL of methanol is very cautiously added (Note 8). After evolution of gas has ceased, the reaction mixture is diluted with 250 mL of anhydrous THF and triethylamine (48.6 mL, 35.3 g, 0.347 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 9) is added in one portion. With vigorous stirring, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (72.9 g, 0.334 mol, 1.01 equiv) is added portionwise (Note 10), followed by 200 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 11). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 3 h. After this time, the solvents are removed in vacuo (Note 12) and the resulting white solid is suspended in 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 300 mL of water and stirred vigorously. The white residues are dispersed by the gradual addition of 400 mL of a 1:1 solution of 1.2 N aqueous HCl and brine. After being stirred for 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel and is shaken with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are then shaken with a 1:1 solution of 0.6 N HCl and brine (200 mL), followed by a 1:1 solution of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine (200 mL), and finally, water (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (100 g), filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo (Note 12) to leave 100 mL of mother liquor. After addition of 300 mL of hexane, the solution is chilled at \u221220 \u00b0C for 12 h to induce precipitation. The mixture is then filtered through a 90 -mm B\u00fcchner funnel (fitted with 90-mm diameter Whatman 1 filter paper) to obtain crude tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate and the filtrate is kept. The crude product is purified by repeated recrystallization from dichloromethane-cyclohexane (3 crops) (Note 13) to afford 71.1 g (91%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate as white needles after drying in vacuo (Note 12). The clear filtrate kept from each recrystallization is combined, concentrated in vacuo (Note 12), and the resulting mixture (usually an off-white solid or a sticky cream foam) purified by column chromatography (Note 14) yielding a further 2.68 g (3.4%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate after removal of solvents and drying in vacuo (Note 12). Total yield of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate is 73.8 g (94%) obtained as white needles (Note 15).",

The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of methanesulfonyl chloride (6.86 mL, 10.1 g, 0.0885 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 17) and 100 mL of dry dichloromethane, which is then added to the flask dropwise over 1 h. The reaction mixture is stirred at <20 \u00b0C for 12 h (Notes 18, 19), after which time 150 mL of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution are added. After being stirred for a 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined organic phases are then washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying the organic phase over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), the solvents are filtered, then are removed in vacuo (Notes 12 and 20) to yield 27.8 g (105%) of an off-white solid that is recrystallized from dichloromethane-hexane (Note 13) to give (2S)-2-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-phenylethyl methanesulfonate (25.0 g, 94%) as a cream powder (Note 21).",

The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow slurry is first taken up in dichloromethane (30 mL) and then is triturated with hexane (200 mL) and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The remaining slurry is treated in the same manner twice more (Note 24). The combined extracts are filtered through a silica plug (ca. 20 g, 3 cm long, 5 cm in diameter), which is washed with 50 mL of hexane. The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The light-yellow liquid residue is purified by column chromatography (Note 25) to afford 11.9 g (88%) of the 6 as a clear colorless liquid (Note 26).",
            "D. (R)-3-Methyl-3-phenylpentene (7).2 The pre-catalyst is prepared as follows in a glove-box: A 100-mL, pear-shaped Schlenk flask with one side-arm fitted with a rubber septum and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with argon. The flask is charged with anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 27) and is transferred into a glove-box (Note 28). To the flask is quickly added [di(\u03bc-bromo)bis(\u03b7-allyl)nickel(II) (180 mg, 0.50 mmol, 0.01 equiv), (R)-2,2'-binaphthoyl-(S,S)-di(1-phenylethyl)aminoylphosphine (539 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 29) and NaBArF24 (886 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) in the order mentioned. The resulting suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a dark-brown solution containing a small amount of fine particles (NaBr).\nA 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a Teflon-taped flow-controlled argon inlet, a thermometer, and a magnetic stir bar is flame-dried and purged with argon. The flask is then charged with 150 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 27). The catalyst solution prepared above, now removed from the drybox, is introduced to the vessel via cannula. The flask containing the catalyst solution is further rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane, and this solution is also transferred to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of pre-catalyst transfer, the system closed at the flow-controlled stopcock and then is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, creating a small vacuum. A strong flow of dry ethylene (Note 30) is introduced through a needle through the serum stopper to relieve the vacuum and then is adjusted to maintain a pressure of 1 atm by releasing excess gas through an oil bubbler. The introduction of the ethylene causes the internal temperature to rise. Within ca. 5 min, the internal temperature increases by 5 \u00b0C and the ethylene line is removed (Note 31). The solution is cooled back to \u221270 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring. A solution of 2-phenyl-1-butene (6) (6.60 g, 50.0 mmol) in 30 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 27) is introduced as a weak stream into the solution of pre-catalyst over a two-minute period via syringe followed by a 10 mL rinse with dichloromethane. Ethylene is introduced again through a needle, first as a strong flow and then regulated to maintain a pressure of 1 atm. Under an ethylene atmosphere, the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is then maintained between \u221265 \u00b0C and \u221270 \u00b0C for a period of 4 h. At the end of this period the ethylene line is removed and the reaction mixture is slowly poured into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 mL of pentane (Note 32) is and combined with a 50-mL pentane rinse of the reaction vessel. After being warmed to ambient temperature, the resulting, cloudy solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (Merck, grade 9385, mesh 230-400, 60 \u00c5, 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm, (d \u00d7 h)), which is eluted with 100 mL of pentane (Note 33). The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 7.99 g (99.7%) of (R)-3-methyl-3-phenylpentene (er 98.8:1.2) as a clear, liquid (Notes 34 and 35)."

The mixture is allowed to cool for 30 min and then is heated back to reflux. Another portion of hexane (100 mL) is added and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, then are washed with two 100-mL portions of a mixture of ice-cold hexane/TBME, 2:1. After a second recrystallization from hexane/TBME, 1:1 (250 mL each), the isolated crystals are dried in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 0.15 mmHg) for 8 h at room temperature to provide 21.05 g (52%) of the product 2 as colorless, diastereomerically pure microcrystals (Notes 17, 18).",
            "C. (R)-2-(Benzyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-3-phenylpropanoic acid (3). A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer (fitted with an 8-cm Teflon paddle), and a Teflon-coated thermocouple is charged with 2 (20.0 g, 34.9 mmol), THF (204 mL) and water (102 mL). Hydrogen peroxide (30%, 14.3 mL, 139.6 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 19) is then added and the resulting mixture cooled to 0\u20135 \u00b0C in an ice bath. Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (2.34 g, 55.8 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 20) is added and stirring is continued at 0\u20135 \u00b0C for 2 h (Notes 6, 21). The suspension is allowed to warm to room temperature, then is slowly diluted with aq. Na2SO3 solution (20 g in 160 mL, 158 mmol) (Note 22, 23) followed by 1 M aq. NaOH solution (102 mL) and stirring is continued at room temperature for 10 min. The THF is removed on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg, 30 min) and TBME (635 mL) is added to the resulting suspension. After the mixture is stirred for 10 min, the precipitate (recovered DIOZ auxiliary) is filtered off by suction through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel and is successively washed with 1 M aq. NaOH solution (101 mL), water (2 \u00d7 83 mL) and TBME (2 \u00d7 83 mL) (Note 24). The filtrate and all aqueous washes are combined and acidified to pH 2-3 with 0.52 M aq. citric acid solution (Note 25) and then are transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and are extracted with TBME (2 \u00d7 255 mL). The combined TBME phases are washed with brine (255 mL), dried over MgSO4 (19 g, 10 min), filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel and concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg). The resulting oil slowly solidifies upon standing (Note 26) to afford 10.70 g (98%) of 3 with an enantiomer ratio of = 99.9:0.1 (Notes 27, 28, 29)."
