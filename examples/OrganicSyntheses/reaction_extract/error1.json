            "In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, and clamped in a position such that it may be surrounded by a bath of water and ice when desired, are placed 300 g. (1.62 moles) of \u03b2-acetylaminonaphthalene (m.p. 131\u2013132\u00b0) and 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. With the mixture at room temperature, the stirrer is set in motion, and 200 g. (143 cc., 2.1 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) is added dropwise over a period of forty-five minutes; the temperature is kept below 40\u00b0 by occasionally immersing the flask in the cooling bath. When about one-tenth of the nitric acid has been added, the reaction mixture sets to a mass that is stirred with difficulty. The addition of nitric acid is stopped at this point. After three to five minutes the mass becomes fluid, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed. When about one-fourth of the nitric acid has been added, all the solid material dissolves. Considerable heat is evolved at this point, and good cooling is required to keep the temperature from rising above 40\u00b0; the mixture must be cooled during the addition of the remainder of the acid. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer.\nThe flask is stoppered and cooled in a bath of ice and water for three hours; the reaction product should then separate in the form of a yellow, crystalline paste (Note 1) and (Note 2). The crystals are collected on a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed, first with 200 cc. of 50 per cent acetic acid, and next with 400 cc. of ordinary ether. This crude, dry product, weighing 270\u2013290 g., is placed in a 3-l. flask and heated under a reflux condenser with 1.7 l. of benzene for twenty minutes. The mixture is then allowed to cool to 40\u201345\u00b0 and filtered through a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The residue is a mixture of sparingly soluble isomers, chiefly 5- and 8-nitro-2-acetylaminonaphthalene. On further cooling of the filtered solution, there is obtained 190\u2013200 g. of 1-nitro-2-acetylaminonaphthalene melting at 117\u2013119\u00b0. This material is recrystallized from about 500 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. Fine yellow crystals melting at 123\u2013124\u00b0 are obtained. The yield is 175\u2013182 g. (47\u201349 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

The dry residue of ammonium chloride and isobutyramide is boiled 10 minutes with 2 l. of dry ethyl acetate, and the boiling solution is filtered quickly through a fluted filter paper on a large hot funnel. The residue on the filter is extracted in the same way with two 1-l. portions of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are cooled to 0\u00b0, and the crystalline amide which separates is removed by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated to about 300 ml. and chilled, and a second crop of amide is collected (Note 7) and (Note 8).

(1.66 moles) of mesitylene, 1 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 63 ml. (0.84 mole) of formaldehyde solution (concentration, 37%) (Note 2). Hydrogen chloride is introduced below the surface of the mixture (Note 3), which is stirred vigorously and heated in a water bath kept at 55\u00b0. These conditions are maintained throughout the reaction, which requires a total of 5.5 hours. At the halfway point, an additional 63 ml. (0.84 mole) of formaldehyde solution is added (Note 4).\nAfter the mixture has been cooled to room temperature (Note 5), it is extracted with three 300-ml. portions of benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed successively with water, dilute sodium hydroxide, and water, dried over calcium chloride, and filtered. The mixture is distilled through a still head under reduced pressure; the pressure is reduced only slightly while the benzene is distilling. The yield of \u03b11-chloroisodurene boiling at 130\u2013131\u00b0/22 mm. is 155\u2013170 g. (55\u201361%) (Note 6); the distillate solidifies to a crystalline mass which melts at 37\u00b0.",

(1.57 moles) of sodium cyanide, 110 ml. of water, and 160 ml. of ethanol. The flask is heated in a boiling water bath, and the contents are stirred until all the sodium cyanide is dissolved. Then 152 g. (0.90 mole) of \u03b11-chloroisodurene is added slowly, and stirring and heating are continued for 3 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to about 40\u00b0 (Note 7) and extracted with three 300-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene solution is washed well with water, dried over calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled under slightly reduced pressure to remove all the benzene. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure from a Claisen flask with a wide-bore side arm. The yield of mesitylacetonitrile boiling at 160\u2013165\u00b0/22 mm. is 128\u2013133 g.

Before the apparatus is assembled, it is washed in the following manner with absolute ethanol which has been prepared in a distilling flask (Note 2). Ninety milliliters of the anhydrous ethanol is distilled through the dropping funnel into the apparatus, used for rinsing, and discarded. In the reaction flask are placed 12.5 g. (0.52 atom) of magnesium turnings, 1 ml. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 3), and 40 g. (0.25 mole) of malonic ester (Note 3); then 90 ml. of absolute ethanol is distilled into the dropping funnel and transferred to the flask. The reaction is started by heating and is controlled by applying an ice bath when the condenser begins to flood. When the reaction has subsided, 40 g. (0.25 mole) more of malonic ester is added at one time. After this reaction has subsided, the flask is cooled slightly, 180 ml. of dry ether is added, and the reaction mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour. Then 88 g. (74 ml., 0.57 mole) of phenylacetyl chloride, diluted with 90 ml. of dry ether, is added slowly (in about 30 minutes) from the dropping funnel in portions at such a rate that the vigorous reaction subsides between additions. When the addition has been completed, the flask is warmed for 10 minutes on a steam bath. After the mixture has been cooled, 100 ml. of water is added dropwise in about 30 minutes. The oily layer is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump).

The mixture is stirred in an atmosphere of nitrogen for 5 minutes without heating (Note 7). The precipitate is removed by filtration, washed with a small amount of distilled water, transferred to a beaker, and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of hot absolute ethanol. To the warm filtrate is added 200 ml. of water, and the solution is allowed to cool in an ice bath for 2 hours.

In a 200-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a stirrer, and a condenser, is placed 65 ml. of water; the water is then boiled to expel dissolved oxygen. To the boiling water is added 16.5 g. of the crude acid (Note 9), and the mixture is boiled with stirring for 2 hours in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The water is decanted from any pasty residue; the residue is boiled with 35 ml. of water for 2 hours, and the supernatant liquid is decanted through a filter and combined with the first solution. Just enough sodium hydrosulfite (about 0.3\u20130.5 g.) is added to decolorize the red solution, 15 g. of sodium chloride is dissolved in the solution, and the mixture is allowed to stand at 5\u00b0 for 24 hours. The naphthoresorcinol precipitates first as an oil, which solidifies to a reddish solid on further cooling, and then as colorless or slightly yellow plates. The yield is 7.0\u20137.3 g.

After standing over calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator for 1 day, the white or slightly yellow plates melt at 119\u2013122\u00b0 and the reddish solid melts at 110\u2013118\u00b0.\nTo 100 ml. of hot water are added 3.5 g. of the reddish solid, just enough sodium hydrosulfite to remove the red coloration, and 0.3 g. of Norit. The mixture is filtered, 7 g. of sodium chloride is dissolved in the filtrate, and the solution is allowed to stand in a closed container at 5\u00b0 for 24 hours.

Within several seconds the contents of the flask set to a crystalline mass and the temperature rises to 20\u201325\u00b0. The flask is heated on a steam bath until the crystalline material dissolves and is then cooled with stirring to 45\u00b0, at which temperature crystals begin to separate. An ice bath is applied, and 100 ml. (55% excess) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is added all at once. The temperature rises rapidly to 70\u00b0 and soon begins to fall. By suitable adjustment of the cooling bath the temperature is maintained at 60\u201365\u00b0 for 10 minutes and then brought down to 25\u00b0 in the course of 10 minutes (Note 2).\nThe solution is chilled overnight in an ice chest, and the precipitated yellow crystals are collected on a 19-cm.

(5.15 moles) of zinc dust (90% zinc) is added in small portions over a period of 5 minutes. About 5 minutes after the addition of the zinc, the main reaction occurs and the temperature rises. When the temperature reaches about 65\u00b0, enough ice is added to the stirred mixture to bring the temperature down to 50\u201355\u00b0 (Note 5). Twenty minutes after the addition of zinc was started, the solution is filtered through a 24-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and the zinc oxide residues are washed with 3 l. of boiling water. The filtrate and washings are combined in a 6-gal. crock (Note 6) and cooled immediately (Note 7) by the addition of enough ice to bring the temperature to 0\u00b0 to \u22122\u00b0 and leave at least 1 kg. of ice unmelted.\nTo this cold solution or suspension of \u03b2-phenylhydroxylamine, a cold solution of sulfuric acid (750 ml. of concentrated acid and sufficient ice to bring the temperature down to \u22125\u00b0) is added with stirring. An ice-cold solution of 170 g. of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 500\u2013750 ml. of water is added as rapidly as it can be poured into the mixture, which is stirred or swirled (Note 8). After 2 to 3 minutes, the straw-colored precipitate of nitrosobenzene is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 1 l. of water (Note 9).\nThe crude nitrosobenzene is steam-distilled (Note 10), and the distillate is collected in a receiver cooled by ice (Note 11). The nitrosobenzene is finely ground in a mortar, transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel, and washed with water until the washings are no longer brown. After it has been sucked as dry as possible on the filter the nitrosobenzene is pressed between layers of filter paper (or other porous paper). One or two changes of paper may be necessary. The yield of nitrosobenzene melting at 64\u201367\u00b0 is 128\u2013138 g. (49\u201353%) (Note 12) and (Note 13). If a purer product is desired, the crude nitrosobenzene can be recrystallized from a small amount of ethanol with good cooling, and the product dried over calcium chloride at atmospheric pressure."

            "A. Sebaconitrile. A 3-l. three-necked flask (Note 1), equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 2) and (Note 3) and a thermometer which dips into the liquid, is heated in an oil bath to 160\u00b0. In the flask are placed 505 g. (2.5 moles) of commercial sebacic acid (Note 4) and 180 g. (3 moles) of urea (Note 5), and the melt is heated with stirring for 4 hours at about 160\u00b0 (Note 6). The oil bath is removed, the surplus oil is wiped off, the flask is insulated (Note 7), and the temperature is then raised, as rapidly as foaming permits, to 220\u00b0 by means of a triple burner and wire gauze. It is important to continue the stirring for at least 5 minutes after 220\u00b0 is attained; otherwise the mass will foam over during the subsequent distillation.\nThe stirrer is then replaced by a short still head connected to a long (90-cm.) air condenser and receiver (Note 8), and the product is distilled at atmospheric pressure as long as any distillate is obtained. The temperature of the vapor rises gradually to 340\u00b0. The distillate, which consists chiefly of water, dinitrile, acid nitrile, and sebacic acid, is poured into a large (2-l.) separatory funnel and, after the addition of 500 ml. of ether (Note 9), is extracted three times with 650-ml. portions of 5% ammonium carbonate (Note 10). The crude dinitrile which remains after the removal of the ether is distilled under reduced pressure; after a small fore-run (20\u201325 ml.) the main product is collected at 185\u2013188\u00b0/12 mm. (Note 11). The yield of sebaconitrile is 190\u2013200 g. (46\u201349%) (Note 12).",
            "B. \u03c9-Cyanopelargonic acid. The combined ammoniacal extracts are heated nearly to boiling in a large enameled pot or 4-l. beaker and neutralized to phenolphthalein with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 120 ml.) (Note 13). A hot solution of 400 g. of barium chloride is then added slowly with stirring, and the hot solution is filtered from the precipitated barium sebacate (Note 14) through a fluted filter paper or \"Shark Skin\" filter paper (Note 15) on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The barium salt of the cyano acid that separates on cooling is filtered on the same sized funnel and dissolved in 1 l. of hot water, and the solution is acidified to litmus with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 30 ml.). The cyano acid separates as a clear oil. The filtrate from which the barium salt was filtered is acidified likewise to litmus with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 50 ml.). The two oils are combined. The cyano acid is washed by decantation with three 200-ml. portions of hot water, separated completely from water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield of \u03c9-cyanopelargonic acid melting at 48\u201349\u00b0 is 146\u2013155 g. (32\u201334%) (Note 16)."

Six hundred grams (4.5 moles) of reagent grade anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 2) is placed in the Erlenmeyer flask and is added to the stirred reaction mixture during a period of 2 hours. The mixture becomes dark brown, refluxes gently, and evolves hydrogen chloride. After addition of all the catalyst, the mixture is heated on a steam bath with continued stirring for 16 hours.

After the ice bath is removed the contents of the flask are heated during 20 minutes (vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride) to the boiling point by means of a water bath, and refluxing is continued for about 5 minutes. As stirring is continued the flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath until the internal temperature (Note 3) reaches about \u221210\u00b0.

(1.28 moles) of anhydrous stannic chloride in 150 ml. of dry thiophene-free benzene (Note 1), as the temperature is maintained below 15\u00b0. The reaction is highly exothermic, and hydrogen chloride is rapidly evolved. Stirring is continued for 1 hour at 0\u201310\u00b0, at the end of which time the thermometer is replaced by the condenser and the complex is decomposed by careful addition of 300 g. of ice followed by 250 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. This two-phase mixture is heated to reflux, with vigorous stirring, on a water bath for about 25 minutes or until hydrogen chloride is no longer evolved (Note 4).\nThe cooled reaction mixture is separated in a separatory funnel, and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of benzene.

The amount of chlorine contained in the resulting yellow-green liquid, estimated volumetrically (Note 4), varies between 25 and 32 g. The gas-inlet tube is replaced by a calcium chloride tube, and the reaction vessel is cooled externally with ice water and protected from light by being covered with a towel.\nOne or two crystals of iodine are added to the chlorine solution, and a solution of p-toluenethiol (7.3 g. per 10 g. of dissolved chlorine, i.e., halogen in 140% excess) (Note 5) in 50 ml. of anhydrous carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) is added dropwise over a period of approximately 1 hour.

A solution of 58.3 g. (0.3 mole, 56 ml.) of t-butyl perbenzoate (Note 1) in 120 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, dropwise, with stirring over a 30-minute period, and the stirring is continued for an additional 5 minutes.\nThe reaction mixture is poured carefully into a cold solution of 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 1. of water. The ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 150-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are extracted with three 25-ml. portions of 2M sodium hydroxide solution, washed with water until the washings are neutral, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 2) and (Note 3).

            "B. 2,4,6-Triphenylphenol. To a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer are added 32 g. (0.10 mole) of 2,4,6-triphenylaniline and 300 ml. of glacial acetic acid. Stirring is begun and the contents of the flask are brought into solution by heating to 70\u00b0. Concentrated sulfuric acid (90 ml., d 1.84) is added dropwise while the temperature is lowered concurrently from 70\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 by cooling. After the addition is completed, the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 with an ice-salt bath, and a solution of 9 g. (0.13 mole) of sodium nitrite in 50 ml. of water is added over a period of 20\u201330 minutes with stirring, the reaction temperature being kept at 0\u20135\u00b0. The stirring is continued for 20 minutes after the sodium nitrite solution has been added, then 300 ml. of ice-cold water and 3 g. of urea or amidosulphonic acid are added in small portions. The yellow diazonium salt solution is filtered with suction into an ice-cold flask and is kept cold (at 0\u00b0) while the next step is carried out.\nTo a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel is added a mixture of 600 ml. of water and 150 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (d 1.84). The acid solution is vigorously stirred and heated to boiling, and the cold diazonium salt solution is added at such a rate that the boiling is not interrupted (Note 6). The time required for this addition should not exceed 30 minutes. After the addition is completed, boiling is continued for 10 minutes and then the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring. The product is collected on a Buchner funnel, washed, with water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide to give 28\u201332 g. of crude 2,4,6-triphenylphenol. After drying, the product is dissolved in ca. 200 ml. of benzene and filtered through a layer of 300 g. of alumina packed in a 30-mm. \u00d7 75-cm. chromatohgraphy column (Note 7). The product is eluted with benzene until about 500 ml. of eluate has been collected. The collected eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at 50 mm. pressure and 50\u00b0 to yield light yellow crystals, which are recrystallized from glacial acetic acid (10 g. of 2,4,6-triphenylphenol requires ca. 30\u201335 ml. of acetic acid). The pure, nearly colorless product (13\u201315 g., 39\u201347%) melts at 149\u2013150\u00b0.",

To this solution is added 60 ml. of a filtered, saturated solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) in 2N sodium hydroxide solution (Note 8), and the resulting mixture is vigorously shaken for about 10 minutes. After a few minutes the dimer of 2,4,6-triphenylphenoxyl begins to separate in the form of pink crystals. The crystals are isolated by filtration, washed with several portions of water (Note 9) and twice with ether. After drying in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide while protecting from light, the product weighs 8\u20139 g. (81\u201391%) and melts at 145\u2013150\u00b0 to a red liquid (Note 10). The purity of the 2,4,6-triphenylphenoxyl dimer (which in solution attains a rapid equilibrium with its red monomer) is established by titration with a solution of hydroquinone in acetone (Note 11). The radical titer of a freshly prepared solution of the dimer in benzene or acetone should be 98\u201399%."

The combined ether extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, which are combined with the aqueous residue (Note 5), dried over magnesium sulfate or potassium carbonate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 29\u201331 g. (93\u201399%) of cis-4-tert-butylcyclohexanol as a white solid. Analysis of the crude product by GC shows it contains 95.8\u201396.2% cis-alcohol and 4.2\u20133.8% of the trans isomer with essentially no ketone remaining (Note 6). Recrystallization from 40% aqueous ethanol affords greater than 99% pure cis-alcohol, m.p. 82\u201383.5\u00b0 after sublimation (Note 7)."

After about 15 minutes the initial rapid evolution of carbon monoxide becomes greatly diminished and an additional 8 g. of the nonacarbonyl is added; additional 8-g. quantities are added at intervals (approximately 15 minutes), governed by the rate of carbon monoxide evolution. The addition is continued until no more carbon monoxide is liberated (Note 2), and the reaction mixture is stirred at 50\u00b0 for an additional hour. Approximately 140 g. of diiron nonacarbonyl is required for the complete conversion of the dichlorocyclobutene, the total reaction time being about 6 hours.\nThe contents of the flask are then filtered with suction through Filtercel and the residue, while kept in the Buchner funnel, is thoroughly washed with pentane until the washings are colorless (Note 3). The pentane and much of the benzene are evaporated from the combined filtrates with a water aspirator.\nThe residual liquid is transferred to a flask equipped with an efficient fractionating column and distilled under reduced pressure. Benzene is removed first, followed by considerable quantities of iron pentacarbonyl (b.p. 20\u00b0, 30 mm.); when the diiron nonacarbonyl has been removed, the pressure is reduced further and cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl2 is collected as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 47\u00b0 (3 mm.), yielding 13.8\u201314.4 g.

            "A. \u03b1-Bromophenylacetic acid. A 3-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser (Note 1) is charged with 750 ml. of benzene, 230 g. (1.69 moles) of phenylacetic acid (Note 2), 15 g. (0.12 mole) of phosphorus trichloride and 288 g. (1.80 moles) of bromine (Note 3). The resulting solution is heated at gentle reflux for 2\u20133 days until the initial bromine color is discharged. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and after 1 hour is decanted from some polymeric material into a 2-l. distilling flask. Removal of the solvent by distillation at water bath temperatures with the aid of a water aspirator gives a black oil which is poured into 250\u2013300 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0). The mixture is heated, dissolving the oil, and the solution is stored at \u221225\u00b0 in a freezer for 12 hours. Filtration on a sintered-glass funnel followed by washing with 200 ml. of cold (10\u00b0) ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0) gives 243 g. (67%) of \u03b1-bromophenylacetic acid as a white solid, m.p. 73\u201383\u00b0. Recrystallization from about 400 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0) with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon affords 217\u2013233 g. (60\u201362%) of the purified acid, m.p. 80.5\u201384\u00b0.",
            "B. \u03b1,\u03b1'-Diphenylthiodiglycolic acid. In a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask a suspension of 223 g. (1.04 moles) of \u03b1-bromophenylacetic acid in 1.25 l. of water is brought into solution by addition of a solution of 157 g. (1.48 moles) of sodium carbonate in 700 ml. of water. A solution of 104 g. (0.8 mole) of sodium sulfide (60\u201362% pure fused flakes) (Note 4) in 700 ml. of water is added, and the resulting mixture is stirred mechanically at room temperature for 3 hours, heated to the boiling point, filtered while hot, cooled, and cautiously acidified (in a hood) with 3 N hydrochloric acid. Filtration followed by washing with 200 ml. of water yields 135\u2013140 g. (86\u201389%) of crude acid, m.p. 130\u2013140\u00b0, which is sufficiently pure for use in the next step (Note 5).",

(0.33 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide over a 30-minute period, with ice bath cooling and magnetic stirring. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature (Note 6), and after 3 days 30 g. (0.19 mole) of bromine is added in one portion, followed by 30 g. of potassium bromide in 150 ml. of water. A sunlamp (Note 7), focused on the reaction mixture from a distance of 1 in., causes the solution to warm to 80\u00b0 (Note 8). After heating at 80\u00b0 for 30 minutes the mixture is cooled, and the solid is filtered and washed with water and ethanol, yielding 9\u201310 g. (27\u201330%) of crude \u03b1,\u03b1'-dibromodibenzyl sulfone, m.p. 135\u2013150\u00b0. The mixture of diastereomers is pure enough to be used directly in the synthesis of 2,3-diphenylvinylene sulfone (Note 9).",
            "A. Dibenzyl sulfide. A solution of 25.8 g. (0.212 mole) of benzyl chloride in 75 ml. of 95% ethanol contained in a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient bulb condenser (Allihn) and a magnetic stirrer is brought to gentle reflux with a heating mantle. With stirring and heating, a solution of 36 g. (0.15 mole) of sodium sulfide nonahydrate in 50 ml. of water is added with a dropping funnel over a 4-hour period. The solution is heated at reflux for 3 days, after which the ethanol is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The hot aqueous solution is poured with stirring into a 250-ml. beaker half-filled with chipped ice. After the ice has melted, the resulting yellow solid is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of water. After air-drying, the solid is distilled from an ordinary 50-ml. Claisen flask, yielding 17.6 g. (80%) of dibenzyl sulfide, b.p. 120\u00b0 (0.15 mm.) (Note 1), which is pure enough to use directly in the next step. Recrystallization from 70% ethanol gives a pure sample, m.p. 46\u201348\u00b0.",
            "B. \u03b1,\u03b1'-Dibromodibenzyl sulfone. To a gently refluxing solution of 11.35 g. (0.05304 mole) of dibenzyl sulfide in 150 ml. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) contained in a three-necked, round-bottomed flask is added, dropwise over a period of 1.5 hours, a solution of 17.6 g. (0.0978 mole) of bromine in 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, while a sunlamp (Note 3) is focused on the reaction mixture from a distance of 1 in. The solution is refluxed with a heating mantle for 3 hours, and the carbon tetrachloride removed at a water bath temperature of 50\u00b0 with the aid of a water aspirator. To the residual dark oil is added 25 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 4), and after cooling in an ice bath a solution of 32.5 (0.189 mole) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (Note 5) in 150 ml. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise over a 30-minute period. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 days.\nThe solvent is evaporated with an air jet at room temperature, and to the residual solid is added saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution until effervescence ceases. Filtration of the remaining solid followed by washing with water and cold ethanol gives 6.5 g. (30%) of crude \u03b1,\u03b1'-dibromodibenzyl sulfone, m.p. 142\u2013158\u00b0. This mixture of diastereomers is pure enough for use in conversion to 2,3-diphenylvinylene sulfone (Note 6)."

The reaction mixture is maintained between \u221228\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 throughout the addition, which is terminated after 71 g. (1.0 mole) of chlorine has been added. After the addition, which takes approximately 1 hour, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0 and 50 g. of powdered sodium carbonate is added, and the contents are shaken gently for several minutes. This treatment removes any hydrochloric acid which may have been produced during the reaction. The mixture is then filtered directly into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask containing 135 g. (0.951 mole) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. A condenser is fitted to the flask and the solution is heated at gentle reflux for 3 hours (Note 1). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (Note 2). The crude Diels-Alder adduct, which will slowly solidify on standing, is used directly in the next step.\nThe crude Diels-Alder adduct is transferred to a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached to a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask; the latter is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 200\u00b0 and equipped with a distillation head, condenser, and receiving flask. The pressure inside the equipment is reduced to 20 mm. A magnetic stirrer in the pyrolysis flask is started, the Diels-Alder adduct (Note 3) is added slowly to the hot flask, and the pyrolysate collected in the receiving flask. The distillation temperature during the pyrolysis varies from 135\u00b0 to 152\u00b0, depending on the rate of addition of the Diels-Alder adduct. After the addition is complete (about 1 hour), the pyrolysis is continued for a further 30 minutes or until very little material remains in the pyrolysis flask (Note 4). The crude pyrolysate is then redistilled at 12\u201315 mm., with all material boiling below 140\u00b0 collected; this distillate consists mainly of a mixture of dichlorocyclobutene and 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, the residue being mainly dimethylphthalate.\nA Final distillation at 55 mm. through a 36-in., platinum spinning band column yields 49\u201352 g. (40\u201343%) of pure cis-3,4-dichlorocyclobutene (b.p. 70\u201371\u00b0, 55 mm.); the forerun (b.p. 58\u201362\u00b0, 55 mm.) consists mainly of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene (Note 5)."

The original reaction vessel is rinsed with 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201375\u00b0) (Note 9), the rinse is added to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the product, and the mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes at a rate sufficient to achieve homogenization. The resulting loose emulsion is quickly transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and allowed to separate; the lower (aqueous) phase is drawn off into the original Erlenmeyer flask and the upper (organic) layer containing the desired product is transferred to a 500-ml. flask. In exactly the same manner the aqueous phase is extracted by vigorous stirring with two 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether, the organic layers being added to the retention flask (Note 10). The combined organic layers are transferred from the flask to the same separatory funnel and shaken once with 100 ml. of cold, 5%, aqueous sodium carbonate and twice with 50-ml. portions of cold water. The organic layer is returned to the retention flask, dried over 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered by gravity, concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Note 11), and distilled under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column, yielding 75\u201382 g. (66\u201373%, based on diethyl fumarate) of the product, b.p. 129\u2013132\u00b0 (5 mm.), n25D 1.4565\u20131.4570, d254 1.0584\u20131.0589 (Note 13)."

With each portion of added amalgam there is also added 10\u201320 ml. (500 ml. total) of 50% acetic acid. The total addition time required is 4\u20135 hours. The solution is decanted from the mercury onto a Buchner funnel and filtered with suction through a layer of Celite 545. The cold filtrate is treated with 1.7 l. of cold 20% sulfuric acid; the acid begins to crystallize immediately. After standing for 4 hours at 20\u201322\u00b0, the acid is collected by suction filtration, washed well with ice-cold water, removing excess sulfuric acid, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid, giving 124 g. (72%) of crystalline product, m.p. 210\u2013213\u00b0. A purer product can be obtained by recrystallization. For minimum losses during recrystallization, the crude acid is divided into two portions, and each is added to 1.2\u20131.5 l. of rapidly stirred, boiling water to effect as rapid a solution as possible. When almost all of the solids have dissolved ca. 1 g. of activated charcoal (Norit) is added, the solution is filtered through a fluted filter, and the filtrate is cooled in ice to induce rapid crystallization (Note 4). The colorless crystals are collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure, yielding 93\u2013107 g. (54\u201362%) of the acid, m.p. 212\u2013214\u00b0."

(0.075 mole) of isobutyric acid (Note 4) is added to the stirred mixture over 5 minutes. The internal temperature rises to 50\u201360\u00b0 and hydrogen evolution is completed by heating the mixture to reflux for 15 minutes. After cooling to 0\u00b0 with an externally applied ice\u2013salt bath (Note 5), 52 ml. of a standard solution of n-butyllithium in heptane (1.45 mmole/ml.; 0.075 mole) (Note 6) is added through the stopper by injection (Note 7) at a temperature below 10\u00b0. The ice bath is retained for 15 minutes before the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 30 minutes to complete the metalation. The resulting turbid solution is cooled, and 13.9 g.

The ice bath is retained for 30 minutes, after which the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 1 hour.\nAt the conclusion of the reaction period, 100 ml. of water is added at a temperature below 15\u00b0 (Note 9). The aqueous layer is separated and the reaction flask and organic layer are washed with a mixture of 50 ml. of water and 75 ml. of diethyl ether. The aqueous layers are combined, back-extracted with 50 ml. of ether, and acidified to Congo red with 6 N hydrochloric acid. The product is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether, washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated. The remaining traces of solvent may be removed in a rotary evaporator, yielding 12\u201312.8 g.

            "A 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a T-tube connected to a source of pure nitrogen. The remaining joint of the T-tube is connected to a bubbling device so that the rate of nitrogen flow can be observed throughout the course of the reaction. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 30 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 1) and 2.4 g. of about 50% sodium hydride in oil (ca. 0.05 mole) (Note 2). Stirring is begun and the contents of the flask are heated to 75\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 3) under a slight pressure of nitrogen. The flask is cooled in a water bath to 30\u00b0, before a solution of 4.45 g. (0.0250 mole) of diphenylacetylene in 20 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide is added dropwise with stirring to the dark-gray solution. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture gradually rises until it approaches 40\u00b0. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is heated to 65\u00b0 and held at this temperature for 2.5 hours. The resulting red-brown reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured into 500 ml. of an ice and water mixture with stirring. After the ice has melted, the mixture is extracted with five 150 ml. portions of diethyl ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with three 100-ml. portions of water, then dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation at reduced pressure, and the product (about 6.0 g.) is chromatographed on 180 g. of alumina (Note 5). Elution with 1:7 (v/v) benzene:n-hexane gives ten 50-ml. fractions, of which the first two contain nearly all the mineral oil from the sodium hydride reagent. Fractions 3 through 8 are combined, and the ether is removed by distillation, yielding 1.2\u20131.4 g. (22\u201325%) of slightly impure 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene (Note 6). Recrystallization from methanol gives 0.55\u20130.70 g. (10.7\u201313.6%) of pure 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene, m.p. 47\u201348\u00b0 (Note 7).\nThe 1H NMR spectrum (60 MHz., CCl4) shows a complex multiplet centered at \u03b4 7.2 attributable to the aromatic protons, and two doublets centered at \u03b4 5.4 and 5.2, respectively, attributable to the olefinic protons."

Dinitrogen tetroxide (39.3 g., 27.1 ml. at \u22129\u00b0, 0.427 mole) (Note 4) is condensed (Note 5) in a graduated, calibrated trap that is protected with a phosphorus pentoxide drying tube and has been swept with dry oxygen.\nThe flask is cooled to \u221210\u00b0, and the dinitrogen tetroxide is distilled with a warm water bath from the trap into the ether, with slow stirring; the transfer is aided by a minimal flow of dry oxygen. The solution is allowed to warm to 0\u20135\u00b0, and the oxygen flow rate is increased to 10 ml. per minute (Note 6). The cyclo\u00f6ctene is dropped into the dinitrogen tetroxide solution, with vigorous stirring, over a 30-minute period. The reaction is exothermic, and the temperature is kept at 9\u201312\u00b0 by cooling with a methanol\u2013dry ice bath at \u221220\u00b0. The dropping funnel is rinsed with 25 ml. of ether, and the yellow solution (Note 7) is stirred for an additional 30 minutes at 10\u00b0 with continued oxygen flow. Triethylamine (121 g., 1.20 moles) (Note 8) is added, with stirring, over a 12-minute period; the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at 4\u201312\u00b0 by maintaining the bath at \u22124\u00b0 (Note 9). The mixture is kept at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes, diluted with 150 ml. of ether, and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0. The excess triethylamine is neutralized with an ice-cold solution of 72 g. of acetic acid in 200 ml. of water, with stirring. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and extracted with three 400-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, three 150-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and again with water (Note 10).\nMost of the ether is removed at room temperature with a rotary evaporator. The water that separates is removed with the aid of a small separatory funnel, and the remaining ether, traces of water, and cyclo\u00f6ctane (Note 11) are distilled at room temperature (10 mm.) over 3 hours, yielding 59\u201361 g. of crude 1-nitrocyclo\u00f6ctene as a yellow oil (Note 12) and (Note 13). Chromatography on silica gel (Note 14) with successive elution with n-hexane and benzene gives 39\u201340 g. (63\u201364%) of 1-nitrocyclo\u00f6ctene (Note 15). Distillation (Note 16) gave an analytically pure sample, b.p. 60\u00b0 (0.2 mm.), nD20 1.5116 (Note 17)."

Naphthalene (25.6 g. or 0.200 mole, (Note 1)) is dissolved in a mixture of 250 ml. of anhydrous ethylamine and 250 ml. of anhydrous dimethylamine (Note 2) in a 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer (Note 3) and a dry ice condenser and cooled in an ice bath. To this solution is added rapidly (Note 4), piecewise with stirring, 11.55 g. (1.674 g.-atoms) of lithium metal wire cut into 0.5-cm. lengths (Note 5). After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and the blue solution is stirred for 14 hours, additional dry ice being added to the condenser as required. The dry ice condenser is replaced with a water condenser and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight, during which time the volatile amine solvents evaporate (Note 6). The top of the condenser is protected with an anhydrous calcium sulfate drying tube, maintaining anhydrous conditions in the reaction vessel during the evaporation of solvent (Note 7). The reaction flask is placed in an ice bath and the grayish-white residue is hydrolyzed by the cautious, dropwise addition of 500 ml. of water, with occasional stirring. After the resulting suspension has been filtered with suction, the residual solid is washed with four 25-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous phase of the filtrate is extracted with four additional 25-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried over calcium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, separating 19\u201320 g.

This mixture should be either stored under a nitrogen atmosphere or immediately subjected to the described purification procedure (Note 9).",
            "B. Purification of \u03949,10-octalin. A 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, to maintain a nitrogen atmosphere in the reaction vessel throughout the portions of this preparation where anhydrous conditions are employed. A solution of 2.35 g. (0.0618 mole) of sodium borohydride and 11.55 g. (0.1650 mole) of 2-methyl-2-butene (Note 10) in 100 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added to the reaction flask. A solution of 11.75 g. (0.08275 mole) of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in 22 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is then added, dropwise and with stirring, over a 45-minute period. Although the initial rate of addition must be slow to control the exothermic reaction, the rate can be increased during the latter part of the reaction. To the resulting tetrahydrofuran solution of bis(3-methyl-2-butyl)borane is added, dropwise and with stirring over 10 minutes, the mixture of \u03949,10- and \u03941,9-octalins (19\u201320 g. containing ca. 0.03 mole of \u03941,9-octalin) obtained in Part A. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours and treated with 50 ml. of water. After 35 ml. of 3 M aqueous sodium hydroxide has been added, dropwise and with stirring over 10 minutes, 35 ml. of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise over a 45-minute period, with continuous stirring. The resulting mixture is heated to 45\u00b0 (Note 11) with stirring for 5 hours, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The organic layer is separated, washed with four 30-ml. portions of water, and dried over calcium sulfate. After the organic solution has been tested with moist starch-iodide paper to ensure the absence of peroxides, the volatile solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure in an apparatus fitted with a capillary tube to admit nitrogen as an ebullator (Note 12). After 1\u20132 g. of forerun has been separated, 9\u201313 g. (33\u201348% based on the starting naphthalene) of \u03949,10-octalin is collected at 75\u201377\u00b0 (14 mm.), nD20 1.4990. The product is at least 99% \u03949,10-octalin, by GC analysis (Note 8), and is stored under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 9)."

            "A 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 600-ml. dropping funnel, and filled with dry nitrogen is charged with 500 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (distilled from lithium aluminum hydride; see Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 976 (1973) for warning concerning the purification of tetrahydrofuran) and 56 g. (53 ml., 0.67 mole) of thiophene. This mixture is stirred under nitrogen and cooled to \u221240\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath while 490 ml. (0.662 mole) of 1.35 M n-butyllithium in pentane (Note 1) and (Note 2) is added over a 5-minute period via the dropping funnel. The temperature of the mixture is held between \u221230\u00b0 and \u221220\u00b0 for 1 hour, then lowered to \u221270\u00b0 by the addition of dry ice to the bath. Powdered sulfur crystals (20.4 g., 0.638 g.-atom) are added in one aliquot to the stirred mixture. After 30 minutes the temperature is allowed to rise to \u221210\u00b0, whereupon the yellow solution is carefully poured into 1 l. of rapidly stirred ice water, dissolving the lithium thiolate and destroying any unreacted 2-thienyllithium. The pentane layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of water. These aqueous extracts are combined with the aqueous layer, and the whole is chilled and carefully acidified with 4 N sulfuric acid (Note 3). This aqueous phase is immediately extracted with three 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether (Note 4). The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 100-ml. portions of water to remove acid and remaining tetrahydrofuran and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of ether, the residual, golden-brown oil is purified by distillation at reduced pressure. The portion boiling at 53\u201356\u00b0 (5 mm.) is collected, yielding 49.5\u201353.5 g. (65\u201370%) of 2-thiophenethiol as a yellow oil, n25D 1.6110."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser equipped with a drying tube, and addition funnel provided with a pressure-equalizer arm is dried in a 100\u00b0 oven and assembled while warm. The warm apparatus is immediately purged with dry nitrogen, introducing the nitrogen at the top of the addition funnel. The flask is charged with 81 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium azide (Note 1) and 500 ml. of freshly distilled diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Note 2). A simple distillation apparatus is then dried in the oven and assembled while warm under a slow nitrogen purge. The distillation flask is charged with 112 g. of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 3), and after a forerun of approximately 2 g. the remaining material is distilled (b.p. 57\u201358\u00b0) directly into the addition funnel of the reaction flask. During this distillation it is convenient to disconnect the nitrogen stream from the top of the addition funnel and introduce it into the distillation flask. After the distillation is complete, the distillation apparatus is disconnected and the nitrogen stream is again introduced at the top of the addition funnel. The chlorotrimethylsilane (108.6 g., 1.000 mole) (Note 4) is then added rapidly to the sodium azide slurry, and this mixture is stirred at 70\u00b0 for 60 hours. During this period the nitrogen flow is terminated (Note 5).\nAfter the heating period is complete, the nitrogen stream is again initiated, and the mixture is cooled to 30\u00b0. The addition funnel and reflux condenser are replaced with two gas-inlet tubes with stopcocks. One inlet tube is connected to the nitrogen source and the other to a standard vacuum trap, of at least 150 ml. capacity. A vacuum (15\u201320 mm.) is applied to the trap after the latter is cooled to \u221278\u00b0, and the product is then distilled at 30\u00b0 (15 mm.) into the trap. Slight heating is necessary to maintain 30\u00b0, and rapid stirring should be continued throughout. Removal of volatile product is complete within 5 hours under these conditions. The entire system is then slowly pressurized to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen, and the product is redistilled through a 5-cm. Vigreux column. From 121 g. of crude flash distillate are obtained 4.0 g. of forerun and 98 g. (85%) of pure trimethylsilyl azide, b.p. 95\u201399\u00b0. During the distillation the pot temperature is maintained at 135\u2013140\u00b0 with a thermostated oil bath. The pot residue contains 19 g. of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether with traces of trimethylsilyl azide. The purity of the product cut as established by 1H NMR (CCl4) is 98%. A single peak at 13 cps. downfield from tetramethylsilane is observed, the only impurity being siloxane hydrolysis products. Chlorotrimethylsilane is conspicuous by its absence."
