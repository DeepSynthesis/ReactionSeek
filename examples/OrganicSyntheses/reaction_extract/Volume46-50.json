            "In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a reflux condenser protected by a tube of calcium chloride is placed 100 ml. of acetyl chloride; this operation and the subsequent reaction are conducted in a hood. The condenser is temporarily removed, and 50 g. (0.226 mole) of dried 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (N-acetylglucosamine) (Note 1) is added in the course of 2 or 3 minutes with good stirring. The mixture is stirred for 16 hours without external heating at a room temperature of approximately 25\u00b0. The mixture boils spontaneously during the first hour of reaction. It is a clear, viscous, amber liquid at the end of the reaction (Note 2).\nThrough the condenser there is added 400 ml. of chloroform (U. S. P. grade), and the solution is poured with vigorous stirring onto 400 g. of ice and 100 ml. of water in a 3-l. beaker. The mixture is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and shaken. The organic solution is drawn off without delay into a 3-l. beaker containing ice and 400 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The mixture in the beaker is stirred, and the neutralization is completed by shaking the mixture in the separatory funnel. The organic layer is run directly into a flask containing about 25 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The entire washing procedure should be completed within 15 minutes (Note 3). The solution is shaken or stirred with the drying agent for 10 minutes (Note 4). The drying agent is separated on a 7.5-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and is well washed with dry, alcohol-free chloroform or methylene chloride (Note 5). The filtrate passes through an adaptor directly into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The filtrate is concentrated to 75 ml. on a rotary evaporator at 50\u00b0, and dry ether (500 ml.) is rapidly added with swirling to the warm solution (Note 6). Crystallization usually begins after about 30 seconds. The flask is stoppered and set aside for 12 hours at room temperature.\nThe product is scraped from the walls of the flask and broken up by means of a curved spatula. The solid is collected on a 12.5-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 150-ml. portions of dry ether, dried by suction on the filter for 5 minutes, and stored in a desiccator over sodium hydroxide and phosphorus pentoxide. Analytically pure 2-acetamido-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl chloride is obtained; weight 55\u201365 g. (67\u201379%); m.p. 127\u2013128\u00b0 (Fisher-Johns apparatus) (Note 7); typical -NHCOCH3 absorptions at 6.09 \u03bc and 6.49 \u03bc in the infrared; nmr (CDCl3) \u03b4 6.25 and J1,2 3.5 Hz for the H-1 doublet. Evaporation of the mother liquors and addition of ether to the concentrated solution gives an additional 4\u20136 g. (5\u20137%) of crystalline product, m.p. 125\u2013127\u00b0, that is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The pure product may be stored in an open dish in a desiccator at room temperature for at least 3 years without decomposition (Note 8)."

            "A. Degassed Raney nickel catalyst (W7-J). Caution! Raney nickel catalysts which have been prepared by the usual methods should not be heated in vacuum, as large quantities of heat and hydrogen may be given off suddenly, and dangerous explosions may result.2,3\nIn a hood a 2-l., wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask containing 600 ml. of distilled water is placed in an empty water bath and fitted with an efficient stainless steel stirrer, so that its blades are half immersed. The stirrer is started, and 160 g. of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in the water. Then 125 g. of 1:1 aluminum-nickel alloy (Note 1) is added in portions as rapidly as possible, but at such a rate that no material is lost by frothing with the stirrer running at full speed (Note 2). When all the alloy has been added the stirrer is slowed down, and the catalyst is washed down from the sides of the flask with distilled water. As soon as the reaction has subsided the water bath is filled with boiling water, and the catalyst is slowly stirred while the volume is kept up by the occasional addition of distilled water so that the catalyst is well covered at all times. After 6 hours, stirring and heating are discontinued, and the catalyst is allowed to stand at room temperature for 12\u201315 hours. It is then washed by decantation with ten 250-ml. portions of distilled water and transferred to a 1-l., round-bottomed, three-necked flask by means of distilled water. The total volume of catalyst and water is adjusted to 300 ml., and the flask placed in a cold water bath which is equipped with a thermometer. One side arm is fitted with a 100-ml. dropping funnel, and the other two necks are each connected to a 3-l. B\u00fcchner flask by short lengths of thick-walled, wide-bore rubber tubing (Note 3), (Note 4). One of the B\u00fcchner flasks is connected to a vacuum gauge and then to an efficient water pump. The other B\u00fcchner flask is connected directly to a second, equally efficient water pump. To control the pressure inside the apparatus, a screw clamp is placed between each B\u00fcchner flask and each pump (Note 5). With these clamps completely closed both pumps are turned on fully. The pressure inside the apparatus is now gradually reduced by opening the clamps at such a rate that no excessive frothing occurs. When both clamps are fully open, the water bath is heated slowly until the water in the reaction flask begins to boil. The bath is kept at this temperature until there is no more water left in the flask (Note 6). Then, with both clamps fully opened, the temperature of the water bath is raised to 100\u00b0 during 15\u201320 minutes and kept at this temperature for 2 hours. After this time the catalyst is allowed to cool to 50\u201360\u00b0; it is now ready for use.",
            "B. 2,2'-Bipyridine. With the apparatus set as described above, 100 ml. of pure pyridine (Note 7) is poured into the dropping funnel, and the screw clamps are completely closed. Immediately afterward about 80 ml. of the pyridine is run slowly onto the catalyst from the dropping funnel. Under no circumstances is any air allowed to enter the flask. The flask is then shaken carefully in order to wet the catalyst as much as possible with pyridine. Another 80 ml. of pyridine is added in the same way, and the flask is shaken again. Finally 40 ml. of pyridine is added, and air is allowed to enter the flask. The connections to the B\u00fcchner flask are removed, and a reflux condenser is fitted. The reaction mixture is then boiled gently under reflux (Note 8). After about 48 hours the flask is allowed to cool to about 60\u00b0, and most of the liquid is decanted (Hood!) and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (Note 9) into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. Then 50 ml. of fresh pyridine is added to the catalyst in the reaction flask, and the mixture is heated to reflux for 10 minutes. The flask contents are allowed to cool to about 60\u00b0 and the pyridine is decanted and filtered as before. This extraction is repeated two more times. The flask containing the filtrates is then equipped for vacuum distillation (Note 10), and most of the pyridine is removed on a water bath under reduced pressure (20\u201330 mm.) at a bath temperature not exceeding 40\u00b0. Toward the end of the distillation the bath temperature is raised to about 75\u00b0 for 10 minutes (Note 11). The residue from this distillation is extracted with 100 ml. of boiling petroleum ether (Note 12), and the insoluble cream-colored material is collected by filtration and washed with three 25-ml. portions of the boiling petroleum ether (Note 13). The filtrate is chromatographed over alumina (Note 14) using petroleum ether (60\u201390\u00b0) for elution. The first 2 l. of eluate is collected, concentrated to 100 ml., and allowed to stand overnight in a refrigerator. The crude solid (23\u201324 g.) is collected and recrystallized from about 80 ml. of petroleum ether (60\u201390\u00b0) to give 21.0 g. of 2,2'-bipyridine as white crystals, m.p. 70\u201371\u00b0 (Note 15), (Note 16)."

            "A 1-l. polyethylene bottle is fitted with a three-holed rubber stopper. Three lengths of 0.25-in. (6-mm.) stiff polyethylene tubing extend through the stopper into the bottle. One length of tubing serves as an inlet tube for dry nitrogen, which is monitored by first bubbling through mineral oil. The second tube, the gas-outlet tube, carries a polyethylene drying tube packed with indicating Drierite\u00ae. These tubes extend only about 2 cm. into the bottle. The third tube serves as an inlet for anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and extends halfway into the bottle; it is connected to a hydrogen fluoride cylinder by a short length of Tygon\u00ae tubing secured to the cylinder outlet by copper wire. The bottle contains a Teflon\u00ae-covered magnetic stirring bar.\nThe bottle is flushed with dry nitrogen, and a slow stream of nitrogen passes through the bottle during all subsequent operations to ensure the exclusion of atmospheric moisture (Note 2). N-Bromoacetamide (80 g., 0.58 mole) is added (Note 3). The bottle is cooled in a mixture of dry ice and acetone, and 250 ml. of anhydrous ether is added with efficient magnetic stirring. About 100 g. (100 ml., 5 moles) of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is allowed to condense into the bottle with magnetic stirring (Note 4). This requires about 2 hours.\n1-Heptene (49 g., 0.50 mole) (Note 3) is mixed with 50 ml. of anhydrous ether. The solution is added during 20 minutes through what was originally the nitrogen inlet; the hydrogen fluoride inlet now serves as the nitrogen inlet. The reaction mixture is stirred in the dry ice bath for an additional 4 hours. The dry ice bath is replaced by an ice bath, and the mixture is stirred for 40 minutes. It is then allowed to stand overnight in a mixture of dry ice and acetone in a Dewar flask.\nA solution of 690 g. (5.0 moles) of potassium carbonate in 2 l. of distilled water is prepared in a 4-l. polyethylene beaker or pail, and 500 g. of crushed ice and 300 ml. of ether are added. The cold reaction mixture is cautiously added to the carbonate solution with stirring. The pH of the aqueous layer becomes about 9. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether solutions are combined and washed with three 100-ml. portions of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation. The oily residue is fractionated through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure. There is a fore-run of about 0.5 ml., and then 59\u201375 g. (60\u201377%) of 1-bromo-2-fluoroheptane is collected at 70\u201378\u00b0 (15 mm.); n25D 1.4408\u20131.4420.

            "A 200-ml. four-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1), a thermometer, a Claisen-type adapter bearing a dry ice reflux condenser and a dropping funnel, and a gas-inlet tube consisting of a length of 6-mm. glass tubing extending almost to the bottom of the flask. This gas-inlet tube is connected through a stopcock to a safety trap and then to a cylinder of cyanogen chloride (Note 2). The dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube, is charged with 64 g. (0.80 mole) of liquid sulfur trioxide (Note 3). The outlet from the dry ice condenser is connected to a trap cooled in dry ice.\nThe flask is charged with approximately 36.9 g. (0.60 mole) of cyanogen chloride while being cooled in a dry ice-methylene chloride slush bath (Note 4). The flask is allowed to warm to \u22125\u00b0 to melt the cyanogen chloride, and then the liquid sulfur trioxide is added over a period of 0.75\u20131.25 hours. The reaction is very exothermic. During the addition the temperature is gradually decreased from \u22125\u00b0 to \u221215\u00b0 (Note 5). After addition is completed, the reaction mixture is checked for unreacted sulfur trioxide by adding approximately 1\u20132 g. of cyanogen chloride and noting if a temperature rise takes place. If necessary, this test is repeated until no more unreacted sulfur trioxide is left. The reaction mixture at this point is a pulpy, stirrable mass containing some chlorosulfonyl isocyanate, some chloropyrosulfonyl isocyanate, and much precipitated 2,6-dichloro-1,4,3,5-oxathiadiazine-4, 4-dioxide (Note 6).\nThe adapter bearing the dry ice condenser and dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a 16 cm. \u00d7 2 cm. distillation column packed with glass helices (Note 7) and connected to an efficient air-cooled condenser. The condenser has a 100-ml. receiver and is connected to a trap cooled in dry ice and protected by a drying tube to condense unreacted cyanogen chloride. The reaction flask is heated for about 1 hour while the temperature is gradually increased to 110\u2013115\u00b0. At this point, cyanogen chloride is bubbled into the reaction mixture at the rate of about 0.010 mole/min (Note 8). The temperature of the flask is raised to 120\u2013130\u00b0, whereupon chlorosulfonyl isocyanate begins to distil at a head temperature of 90\u2013105\u00b0. When the distillation rate begins to slacken, and after most of the contents of the flask has distilled, the temperature of the flask is raised to 130\u2013150\u00b0. When the residue in the flask is only 3\u20135 ml., the cyanogen chloride flow is discontinued and the distillation is stopped. This part of the reaction (from the start of the cyanogen chloride feed) requires about 0.4\u20130.6 mole of cyanogen chloride and takes about 0.75\u20131 hour.\nThe crude product, which may contain dissolved cyanogen chloride, is redistilled at a pressure of 100 mm. through the helices-packed column. Heating is done very slowly at first to allow the unreacted cyanogen chloride to distil and be condensed in the dry ice trap. The product is collected at 54\u201356\u00b0 (100 mm.); d204 1.626, weight 67.7\u201369.9 g. (60\u201362%) (Note 9),(Note 10),(Note 11)."

            "A. \u03b2-Isovalerolactam-N-sulfonyl chloride. A 200-ml. four-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dry ice-jacketed dropping funnel (Note 1), and a thermometer is cooled with a dry ice-methylene chloride slush bath while 67 ml. of sulfur dioxide (Note 2) is condensed into the flask. Both the dry ice condenser and the dropping funnel are protected with drying tubes containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. With the liquid sulfur dioxide at \u221220\u00b0, the flask is charged with 0.3 g. of finely powdered potassium chloride (Note 3) and 47.1 g. (0.33 mole) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate.2 Then 19.5 g. (0.35 mole) of isobutylene, previously condensed in a cold trap, is added to the dropping funnel. The temperature of the flask is lowered to \u221240\u00b0 to \u221250\u00b0, and isobutylene is added dropwise over a 20-minute period (Note 4), (Note 5). After the isobutylene addition is completed, the cooling bath under the flask is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm up until the solvent begins to reflux (approximately \u22126\u00b0). The colorless contents of the flask are then poured into 125 ml. of water contained in a 400-ml. beaker over a period of 1 minute with vigorous agitation provided by a mechanically driven paddle stirrer. Sulfur dioxide is evolved while \u03b2-isovalerolactam-N-sulfonyl chloride precipitates as a gritty, crystalline, white solid (Note 6). The major portion of dissolved sulfur dioxide is removed by impinging a vigorous stream of air on the surface of the liquid in the beaker until the temperature of the mixture rises again after falling to 0\u20134\u00b0. The precipitate is removed by suction filtration and is washed three times with 33-ml. portions of ice water. The yield of moist product containing 10\u201320% water is 52\u201356 g. (Note 7). The product in this form is more suitable for subsequent conversion to the free \u03b2-lactam than if it is anhydrous or in a more coarsely crystalline form.\nTo prepare the anhydrous compound, the solid is dissolved in methylene chloride, whereupon the water separates as the upper phase. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature to give a colorless, crystalline mass, m.p. 75\u201377\u00b0. Small amounts of the pure compound may be obtained in the form of long needles by recrystallization from ether, m.p. 77\u201378\u00b0. The yield is 43\u201346 g. (65\u201370%) in anhydrous form (Note 8).",
            "B. \u03b2-Isovalerolactam. A 200-ml. beaker is provided with a combination pH electrode, a mechanically driven paddle stirrer, a thermometer, and a syringe or dropping funnel (Note 9). An amount of water just sufficient for immersion of the pH electrode (20 ml.) is introduced, and with vigorous stirring the first portion (about one quarter) of the 52\u201356 g. (about 0.20\u20130.22 mole) of moist \u03b2-isovalerolactam-N-sulfonyl chloride is added. The liberated acid is neutralized by dropwise addition of approximately 10N sodium hydroxide solution (Note 10) to maintain the pH of the mixture between 2 and 8, and preferably in the range 5\u20137 (Note 11). The temperature is kept at 20\u201325\u00b0 with cooling supplied by an ice bath as necessary. More lactam-N-sulfonyl chloride is added as the hydrolysis proceeds.\nHydrolysis is very sluggish at first, especially if anhydrous or coarsely crystalline sulfonyl chloride is used. Hydrolysis of the first one quarter to one half of the sulfonyl chloride requires 1\u20133 hours, and by that time the increasing salt concentration of the solution will cause the separation of the \u03b2-lactam as a second liquid phase. The sulfonyl chloride is significantly more soluble in this water-containing lactam phase, and as a result the rate of hydrolysis increases markedly (Note 12). Hydrolysis of the remainder of the sulfonyl chloride can be completed in about 30 minutes to 1 hour. The pH is adjusted finally to 7, and the mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0 while being repeatedly seeded with sodium sulfate decahydrate. This converts all the precipitated sodium sulfate to the decahydrate (Note 13), and the \u03b2-lactam which originally separated in oily form is dissolved. The sodium sulfate decahydrate is removed by suction filtration and is washed with 90 ml. of chloroform. Small portions of the chloroform washings are then used for repeated extraction of the lactam from the salt solution. The extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and distilled through an 8-in. Vigreux column. Most of the chloroform is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure, b.p. 70\u00b0 (1.0 mm.), n25D 1.4475, freezing point 14.7\u00b0 (Note 14), weight 16.7\u201317.3 g. (51\u201353% overall from chlorosulfonyl isocyanate). The product is 99.8% pure by vapor phase chromatographic analysis."

            "A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel with a pressure-equalizing side arm, and a reflux condenser with a gas take-off at the upper end. The gas take-off is connected by means of rubber tubing to one arm of a glass Y-tube. The other arm of the Y-tube is connected to a source of dry nitrogen gas. The bottom of the Y-tube is immersed just beneath the surface of a little 1,2-dimethoxyethane (monoglyme) contained in a small beaker.\nThe flask is swept with a stream of dry nitrogen. Monoglyme (100 ml.) (Note 1) and sodium hydride (6 g., 0.25 mole) (Note 2) are placed in the flask. A solution of 8.1 g. (0.050 mole) of benzoylacetone (Note 3) and 12.5 g. (0.075 mole) of methyl anisate (Note 4) in 100 ml. of monoglyme is placed in the addition funnel. The funnel is stoppered, and the nitrogen flow rate is adjusted so that approximately 10 bubbles per minute are emitted from the bottom of the Y-tube. The sodium hydride slurry is stirred and heated on the steam bath. When reflux is obtained, the solution of benzoylacetone and methyl anisate is added slowly so that hydrogen evolution is maintained at a controllable rate. The reaction mixture is kept at the reflux temperature for 6 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature, the reflux condenser is replaced with a distillation condenser equipped with a vacuum take-off, and most of the solvent is removed under reduced pressure (ca. 100 mm.) until a thick paste is obtained. The mixture is then cooled in an ice water bath, and 150 ml. of ether is added. Cold water (200 ml.) is placed in the addition funnel, and initially the water is added dropwise (Caution!

            "A. Bis(10,9-borazarophenanthryl) ether. Caution! All the operations involving boron trichloride should be carried out in a good hood.\nA solution of 250 g. (1.48 moles) of 2-aminobiphenyl (Note 1) in 2.0 l. of dry xylene (Note 2) is placed in a 5-l. four-necked flask equipped with a 500-ml. pressure-equalized dropping funnel, a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube loosely packed with calcium chloride, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer. A solution of 250 g. (174 ml., 2.14 moles) of boron trichloride in 250 ml. of very cold xylene is placed in the dropping funnel (Note 3).\nThe boron trichloride solution is added dropwise to the stirred amine solution over a period of 30 minutes; a thick precipitate forms as the first third of the solution is added, but it gradually dissolves, and the reaction mixture is a clear, dark amber solution at the end of the addition. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour; the temperature of the mixture gradually rises from 110\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 as hydrogen chloride and boron chloride are evolved (Note 4). The mixture is cooled to about 100\u00b0, the dropping funnel is replaced by a powder funnel, and 15 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride is cautiously added. The funnel is replaced by a well-greased stopper (Note 5), and the mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours. The mixture is cooled slightly, and an additional 5 g. of aluminum chloride is added. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux at least 16 hours, and then the reflux condenser is replaced by a Claisen head leading to a water condenser and receiver. About 80% of the solvent (1.6\u20131.7 l.) is distilled with vigorous stirring.\nA dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing arm is inserted in place of the stopper, and 2.5 l. of distilled water is added from it with vigorous stirring. The reaction with water is extremely exothermic at first, and the first 30 ml. of water is added not faster than 1 drop per second. The mixture is steam-distilled with heating and vigorous stirring until the head temperature reaches 100\u00b0. A fresh receiver is attached, and the distillation is continued until the distillate no longer smells of xylene; this is usually after about 300 ml. of distillate has been collected in the receiving vessel (Note 6). If necessary, water is added from time to time to maintain the liquid level in the flask. The flask is cooled to room temperature with vigorous stirring (Note 7), and crystalline 10-hydroxy-10,9-borazarophenanthrene separates. The solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with about 750 ml. of water, and dried overnight at 75\u201380\u00b0 in an oven under reduced pressure (200 mm. or below). Dehydration to bis(10,9-borazarophenanthryl) ether usually takes place during the drying. The ether, a tan solid, weighs 221\u2013250 g. (80\u201391%) (Note 8).",
            "B. 10-Methyl-10,9-borazarophenanthrene. The tan bis(10,9-borazarophenanthryl) ether from the previous step is transferred to a dry, 5-l., four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, a 1-l. pressure-equalized dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a very efficient reflux condenser with a drying tube packed with silica gel at the top (Note 9). A 3.2-l. portion of anhydrous ether is placed in the flask, and the mechanical stirrer is started. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, and 700 ml. (2.1 moles) of 3M methylmagnesium bromide solution in ether (Note 10) is added dropwise through the funnel during 1 hour. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux overnight. The mixture is cautiously and slowly poured into 1 l. of ice water and then cautiously acidified with 385 ml. (10% excess) of 6N hydrochloric acid. The ether layer is separated, and the water layer is extracted with five 400-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether fractions are washed with 200 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution; the sodium bicarbonate solution is washed with 300 ml. of ether, which is added to the other ether fractions.\nThe combined ether fractions are dried over 50 g. of magnesium sulfate, the ether is removed at reduced pressure, and the residue is dried overnight at 60\u00b0 (10 mm.). The resulting slightly oily, crystalline, brown solid is a mixture of 10-methyl-10,9-borazarophenanthrene, bis(10,9-borazarophenanthryl) ether, and tars; weight about 220 g.; m.p. 92\u201398\u00b0. The methyl derivative is isolated by continuous chromatography over about 500 g. of Merck basic alumina (chromatography grade) in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 (Note 11). The crude product is placed on top of the alumina, 4 l. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) is poured into the flask, and the extractor is operated for 30\u201335 hours. 10-Methyl-10,9-borazarophenanthrene gradually crystallizes as fine needles on the walls of the flask.\nFig. 1. A, 5-l. three-necked flask with electric heating mantle; B, alumina column 45 cm. \u00d7 3.8 cm. (Merck basic alumina); C, polyethylene tubing; D, condenser (see (Note 11)).\nThe flask is cooled to room temperature, all solvents are allowed to drain from the column, and 120\u2013150 g. of colorless product, m.p. 99\u2013101\u00b0, is separated by filtration and washed with petroleum ether. A second crop, weight 25\u201340 g.,m.p. 98.5\u2013101.0\u00b0, is obtained by concentrating the combined filtrates to about 250 ml. and cooling the concentrate to room temperature. The crops of 10-methyl-10,9-borazarophenanthrene are combined; weight 155\u2013182 g. (54\u201365% based on 2-aminobiphenyl). The product is sufficiently pure for many purposes. A purer product, m.p. 103\u2013104\u00b0,2 may be obtained by recrystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 35\u00b0) (Note 12)."

The color changes gradually from yellow to green, brown, and orange. The stirring is continued at 5\u201310\u00b0 over a period of 1 hour. At the end of this time 500 ml. of ice-cold water is added to the flask, and the orange N-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)-\u03b1-(o-nitrophenyl)nitrone is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed well, and washed with cold water. The nitrone is used in the next step without further purification (Note 7).",

Crushed ice is added after 10 minutes, and the crude solid o-nitrobenzaldehyde is filtered, washed successively with dilute sodium bicarbonate solution and water, and dried over calcium chloride in a desiccator.\nThe light brown material is best purified by distillation under reduced pressure. The yellow aldehyde is collected at 120\u2013140\u00b0 (3 mm.) (Note 10) and melts at 41\u201344\u00b0. This material weighs 48\u201354 g.

Stirring is begun, and 45.0 g. (0.27 mole) of powdered o-aminobiphenyl is added all at once through a powder funnel. When the amine has dissolved, the flask is placed in an ice-salt bath and its contents cooled to a temperature between 0\u00b0 and \u22125\u00b0. A mixture of 30 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 11.0 ml. of fuming nitric acid (density 1.5) is then added dropwise from a separatory funnel while the temperature is kept below 0\u00b0. The addition requires about an hour, and stirring is continued 45 minutes longer. The liquid is poured onto 1.5 kg. of ice in a 4-l. beaker and treated carefully until neutral with a solution of 580 g. (14.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of water cooled to room temperature.

            "Palladous chloride (1.48 g., 0.0083 mole) (Note 1) is placed in a 10-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and 3.6 ml. (0.043 mole) of 37% hydrochloric acid is added. The flask is shaken at about 30\u00b0 until the palladous chloride is dissolved. The chloropalladous acid solution is transferred to a 150-ml. beaker with 45 ml. of distilled water (Note 2). The beaker is equipped with a pH meter and a magnetic or mechanical stirrer. The pH of the stirred solution is brought to 4.0\u20134.5 by slow addition of aqueous 3N sodium hydroxide from a buret. A precipitate may form at high local concentrations of sodium hydroxide, but it dissolves on further stirring. The solution is diluted to approximately 100 ml. in a graduated cylinder and placed in a 200-ml. or 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer and partly immersed in a bath of oil or water. Precipitated calcium carbonate (18 g.) (Note 3) is added. The well-stirred suspension is heated to 75\u201385\u00b0 and held at this temperature until all the palladium has precipitated, as indicated by loss of color from the solution; this takes about 15 minutes. With the mixture still at 75\u201385\u00b0, 6.0 ml. of sodium formate solution (about 0.7N) (Note 4) is added. During the addition CO2 escapes and the catalyst turns from brown to gray; rapid stirring is essential to keep the mixture from foaming over. An additional 4.5 ml. of the sodium formate solution is added, and the reduction is completed by stirring the mixture at 75\u201385\u00b0 for 40 minutes. The catalyst, which is now black, is separated on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 5) and washed with eight 65-ml. portions of water.\nThe moist catalyst is placed in a 200-ml. or 250-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped as described above. Water (60 ml.) and 18 ml. of a 7.7% solution of lead acetate (Note 6) are added. The slurry is stirred and heated at 75\u201385\u00b0 for 45 minutes. The catalyst is separated on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with four 50-ml. portions of water, sucked as dry as possible, and dried in an oven at 60\u201370\u00b0 (Note 7). The dried catalyst, a dark gray powder, weighs 19\u201319.5 g. (Note 8).\nTo establish that the catalyst is active and selective, it is convenient to test it by quantitative hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene. The reaction flask of a low-pressure hydrogenation apparatus (Note 9) is charged with 2.04 g. (0.0200 mole) of phenylacetylene, 0.10 g. of the palladium catalyst, 1.0 ml. of quinoline (Note 10), and 15 ml. of olefin-free petroleum ether (b.p. 80\u2013105\u00b0) or hexane (Note 11). The apparatus is evacuated, and hydrogen is admitted to a pressure slightly above 1 atm. Stirring or shaking is started, causing rapid absorption of hydrogen. The hydrogen pressure is kept close to 1 atm. Absorption of the first 0.0200 mole of hydrogen requires 10\u201390 minutes, depending on the activity of the catalyst. Hydrogen absorption then abruptly slows but does not stop. In synthetic work it is desirable to stop the reaction soon after the required amount of hydrogen has been absorbed."

(0.15 mole) of sodium trichloroacetate (Note 2), and 31.3 g. (0.1 mole) of phenylmercuric chloride. The stirred mixture (Note 3) is heated to reflux (~85\u00b0) by use of a heating mantle. Carbon dioxide evolution, which begins shortly after heating is begun. is accompanied by the appearance of a precipitate of sodium chloride. The reactants are heated at the reflux temperature until no more carbon dioxide evolution is obvious (~1 hour), then cooled to room temperature and poured into 500 ml. of water. The resulting mixture, consisting of a dense oil layer, a solid, and an aqueous layer, is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether layers are then washed with two 50-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent removed using a rotary evaporator. The resulting white solid, which weighs 44.8 g., is dissolved in 130 ml. of hot chloroform and fractionally crystallized. The first three fractions weigh 2.3 g. and are recovered phenylmercuric chloride. Successive reduction of solvent volume and further fractional crystallization provides 25.6 g. of product (65% yield), m.p. 110\u00b0 (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

            "A. Diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylate. An Erlenmeyer flask containing 80 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 1) is placed in an ice bath to cool. To a 2-l. three-necked flask are added (Note 2) 20 g. (0.081 mole) of lump-free o-iodobenzoic acid (Note 3) and 26 g. (0.096 mole) of potassium persulfate (Note 4). The flask is cooled in an ice bath, the chilled sulfuric acid is added, and the flask is swirled in an ice bath for 4\u20135 minutes to produce an even suspension and to control the initial exothermal reaction. The flask is then removed from the ice bath and the time is noted. The reaction mixture foams somewhat and acquires a succession of colors. The flask is mounted in a pan of acetone, a mechanical stirrer with a curved Teflon\u00ae blade is placed in the center neck of the flask and operated slowly, and a 250-ml. separatory funnel is mounted into a side neck. Three flasks are put in an ice bath to cool: one containing 190 ml. of distilled water, another 230 ml. of 29% ammonium hydroxide, and another 400 ml. of methylene chloride.\nAfter the oxidation has proceeded for 20 minutes, the acetone bath is brought to 10\u00b0 by addition of crushed dry ice, and the solution is stirred for 2\u20133 minutes. There is added 20 ml. of thiophene-free benzene (17.6 g., 0.226 mole), and stirring at 10\u00b0 is continued for 1 hour (Note 5). The temperature of the acetone bath is lowered to \u221215\u00b0 by addition of crushed dry ice and the bath kept at this temperature while the chilled 190 ml. of distilled water is added with efficient stirring to precipitate the potassium bisulfate salt of diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylic acid. The 400 ml. of chilled methylene chloride (Note 6) is added, and a 100\u00b0 thermometer is mounted in a side neck in such a way that the 15\u201325\u00b0 section is visible. With efficient cooling (bath at \u221215\u00b0) and stirring, the 230 ml. of chilled 29% ammonium hydroxide (Note 7) is added at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains between 15\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. Approximately 10 minutes is required for the addition, and after the addition the aqueous layer should be alkaline to indicator paper (pH 9). The stirrer and the thermometer are removed and rinsed with water and methylene chloride. The bulk of the aqueous layer is decanted into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask for temporary storage, and the reaction flask is emptied and rinsed into a 500-ml. separatory funnel. The pale tan lower methylene chloride layer is drained into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, the decanted aqueous layer is added to the separatory funnel, and the combined aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The combined extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and the filtrate is evaporated on the steam bath until the product is left as a dry grayish cake. The cake is dislodged and broken up with a stainless steel spatula, and the bulk of the product is transferred to a paper. Material adhering to the flask and spatula is dissolved in boiling methylene chloride and the solution transferred to a tared 500-ml. flask and evaporated to dryness. The solid product is added to the flask and the combined solid is brought to constant weight at steam-bath temperature and water-aspirator pressure. The yield of crude product is 23.3\u201324.4 g. (Note 8).\nBoiling water (275 ml.) is poured into the flask, the product brought into solution at the boiling point, and 0.4 g. of Norit\u00ae is added carefully to the slightly cooled solution. The solution is again heated to boiling, filtered, and allowed to stand for crystallization overnight, eventually at 0\u00b0. The colorless prisms of diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylate monohydrate (Note 9) are collected and air-dried to constant weight at room temperature. The yield of product, m.p. 220\u2013222\u00b0 (dec.), is 20\u201322 g. (72\u201379%, (Note 10).",
            "B. 1,2,3,4-Tetraphenylnaphthalene. To a 100-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with an 11-cm. water-cooled condenser (Note 11) there is added 60 ml. of diethylbenzene (meta and para mixture) (Note 12), and the flask is heated in a fume hood with the free flame of a microburner until refluxing liquid rises well into the condenser. If a cloudy zone of condensate appears at the top of the condenser, the moisture is removed with an applicator stick wrapped with absorbent cotton (Note 13). The same technique is used later for removal of water of hydration which appears in the early stages of the reaction and causes hissing and eruption if allowed to drop back into the flask (Note 14). The flame is removed and 10 g. (0.026 mole) of tetraphenylcyclopentadienone2 (Note 2) and 11.8 g. (0.035 mole) of diphenyliodonium carboxylate monohydrate are added to the flask. The mixture is heated over a microburner at a rate such as to maintain vigorous gas evolution and gentle refluxing. The water of hydration is eliminated in 8\u201310 minutes. The flask is then fitted with a normal reflux condenser and the heating is continued. After 30 minutes considerable undissolved diphenyliodonium carboxylate can still be seen, under illumination, at the bottom of the flask. In another 5 minutes the color changes to transparent red, and in a minute or two longer the solution becomes pale amber. Refluxing is continued until no solid remains (10\u201315 minutes) (Note 15). The flask is then fitted for distillation, and 55 ml. of liquid (diethylbenzene and iodobenzene, b.p. 188\u00b0) is removed by distillation. The residue is cooled and dissolved in 25 ml. of dioxane. The solution is rinsed into a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and diluted with 25 ml. of 95% ethanol. The solution is heated to boiling, and water (6\u20137 ml.) is added gradually until a few shiny prisms remain undissolved on boiling. Crystallization is allowed to proceed at room temperature and then for several hours at 0\u00b0. The precipitate is removed by filtration, and the mother liquor upon further standing deposits a small second crop of crystals (0.3 g., m.p. 1\u00b0 low). The main product melts initially in the range 196\u2013199\u00b0, solidifies on cooling, and remelts sharply at 203\u2013204\u00b0 (Note 16). The total yield is 9.2\u201310.2 g. (82\u201390%)."

The condenser is replaced by a distillation head with a condenser set for distillation, and a distillation capillary is inserted in the thermometer joint. The bulk of the toluene is removed under nitrogen at reduced pressure (Note 3). The distillation head is rapidly removed, and the flask is flushed with nitrogen and closed by a stopper.

The bomb tube is stoppered with a rubber stopper fitted with a drying tube, removed from the dry box, and 75 ml. of methyl iodide (170 g., 1.20 moles) (freshly distilled from calcium hydride) is quickly pipetted into the bomb under a dry nitrogen stream. The bomb is cooled in a dry-ice bath and sealed with an oxygen torch. After warming to room temperature, the bomb is shaken to disperse the salt cake and placed in a bomb furnace which has been preheated to 135\u00b0 (Note 7).\nAfter 36 hours the furnace is allowed to cool, the bomb is removed, cooled to dry-ice temperatures, and opened carefully as there may be residual pressure. The golden brown liquid is poured into a 200-ml. flask, and the methyl iodide is removed on a rotary evaporator Caution! (Hood). The residue from the flask and the bomb is washed into a 500-ml. separatory funnel with 100 ml. each of ether and 1 : 1 solution of Claisen's alkali and water (Note 8). The funnel is shaken, and the alkali layer is removed. The ether layer is extracted four additional times with 100 ml. portions of the alkali (Note 9), washed twice with 75-ml. portions of water, once with saturated aqueous salt solution, and dried by filtration through anhydrous sodium sulfate into a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask. The ether is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the 23.0 g. of yellow oil remaining is allowed to stand at room temperature for 7\u201310 days to permit dimerization of the dienone (Note 10).\nThe 2,6-dimethylanisole is removed by vacuum distillation (nitrogen capillary bubbler) at 35\u201350\u00b0 (0.75 mm. or less pressure). The solid dimerized product2 in the residue is either recrystallized twice from the minimum amount of hot hexane or vacuum-distilled, b.p. 175\u00b0 (25 mm.)

The reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. An hour after the addition of dimethyl ether is complete, trimethyloxonium fluoborate begins to separate. The initially liquid product solidifies slowly.\nThe stirrer is replaced by a filter stick, and the supernatant methylene chloride is withdrawn from the crystalline mass of trimethyloxonium fluoborate; nitrogen is admitted through a bubbler during this operation to prevent atmospheric moisture from entering the flask. The crystals are washed with three 100-ml. portions of anhydrous methylene chloride. The flask is transferred to a dry box, and trimethyloxonium fluoborate is collected on a sintered-glass filter, dried for 2 hours in a vacuum desiccator at 25\u00b0 (1 mm.), and bottled in a stream of dry nitrogen. The fluoborate is colorless; yield 114\u2013124 g. (86\u201394%). Rapidly heated in an open capillary tube, it sinters and darkens, with decomposition, at 141\u2013143\u00b0 (Note 3)."

            "The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. Two 500-ml. round-bottomed flasks without standard-taper joints (which could cause diazomethane to detonate) are used. The gas inlet C is connected to a cylinder of dimethyl ether. Gas inlet C is long enough to reach near the bottom of flask A, but tubing D extends only about halfway into flask B. A calcium chloride drying tube is attached to the gas outlet E. Flask B contains a Teflon\u00ae-covered stirring bar. The pieces of the apparatus are dried in an oven at 110\u00b0; well-dried apparatus is essential for a good yield.\nFig. 1.\nA solution of diazomethane in 200 ml. of xylene is prepared from 15.0 g. (0.146 mole) of nitrosomethylurea5 (Note 1). The diazomethane solution is decanted into flask A, and about 20 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets is added to the solution. The mixture is swirled for a few seconds to ensure removal of most of the water. About 4.2 g. (0.10 mole) of diazomethane is present. Flask A is then immersed in a water bath at 20\u201325\u00b0.\n2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (14.7 g., 0.050 mole) (Note 2), previously dried for at least 1 hour at 80\u2013100\u00b0 (1 mm.), is placed in flask B, which is then immersed to the level shown in Fig. 2 in a bath of acetone maintained at \u221235\u00b0 to \u221240\u00b0 by addition of small amounts of dry ice (Note 3). About 200 ml. of dimethyl ether is rapidly poured from an ampoule into flask B (Note 3). Flasks A and B are connected as shown in Fig. 2, and magnetic stirring is started in flask B. When most of the sulfonic acid has dissolved, gaseous dimethyl ether is introduced through C at such a rate that a rapid stream of individual bubbles passes through the diazomethane solution in flask A. In the course of the reaction all the acid goes into soution and is replaced by a fluffy precipitate of the oxonium salt. The introduction of dimethyl ether is discontinued as soon as the supernatant solution in flask B turns yellow (Note 5) and (Note 6).\nFlask B is separated from the apparatus but kept in the cooling bath, and 200 ml. of anhydrous ethyl acetate is added; addition is slow so as to avoid excessive boiling of the dimethyl ether (Note 7). The flask, with a tube of calcium chloride attached, is gradually brought to room temperature; most of the dimethyl ether evaporates during this operation. Crystalline trimethyloxonium 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonate is separated on a coarse sintered-glass funnel, washed with two 25-ml. portions of ethyl acetate and with 50 ml. of high-boiling petroleum ether, and dried over phosphorus pentoxide at 25\u00b0 (<1 mm.)

(0.12 mole) of sodium nitrite in 25 ml. of water is added dropwise to the well-stirred solution at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0. Excess nitrite is destroyed by adding sulfamic acid in small portions (Note 3). The mixture is cooled to \u221210\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath, and about 50 ml. of liquid sulfur dioxide (Note 4) is poured into the well-stirred reaction. The product is immediately poured onto a mixture of 55.6 g. (0.20 mole) of FeSO4\u00b77 H2O and 1 g. of defatted copper powder in a wide 2-l. beaker.

The solution is dried over calcium chloride and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (bath temperature 25\u00b0) (Note 5). The residue is suspended in 50 ml. of water, and small portions of dilute ammonia are added to the well-stirred suspension until it has a pH of 9 (Note 6). Insoluble impurities are separated by filtration, and 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is precipitated from the filtrate by adding 5-ml. portions of 6N hydrochloric acid with cooling; the sulfinic acid precipitated by each portion of acid is separately collected on a Buchner funnel (Note 7).

The stirred mixture is cooled to \u221215\u00b0, and the solution of sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate and sodium nitrite is added dropwise over a period of about 5 minutes; the cooling and rate of addition are such as to maintain the temperature at \u221215\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours at this temperature, and 30 ml. of ether is added. The product is stirred vigorously for a few minutes and then allowed to warm to \u22126\u00b0 with gentle stirring. The ether layer is decanted or transferred by means of a chilled pipet into a vessel cooled in a dry ice bath, and the reaction mixture is again cooled to \u221215\u00b0.

The combined extracts are dried at \u221220\u00b0, first over calcium chloride and then over phosphorus pentoxide; a cold room at \u221220\u00b0 is particularly convenient for this operation. The solution is transferred to a tared distillation flask immersed in an ice bath (Note 10), and the ether is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The flask is weighed rapidly and dried in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide at \u221220\u00b0 ( Caution! (Note 11)(Note 12)). The residue is 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole 1,1-dioxide in the form of yellow-brown needles; weight 0.77\u20131.04 g. (57\u201377%). It explodes between 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 (Note 13)."

            "In a 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube, is placed 67 g. (0.5 mole) of powdered anhydrous aluminum chloride. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, 500 ml. of dry ether is slowly added from the dropping funnel, and the mixture is stirred for a few minutes. Meanwhile 5.5 g. of powdered lithium aluminum hydride (Note 1) is placed in a 1-l. flask fitted with a condenser, and 140 ml. of dry ether is added slowly from the top of the condenser with caution while the flask is kept cooled in ice. The mixture is gently refluxed for 30 minutes to effect, as far as possible, solution of the hydride. It is then cooled, and the resulting slurry (which consists of a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride in its solution) is transferred to the dropping funnel of the previous setup and is added to the ethereal solution of aluminum chloride with stirring within 10 minutes. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes without cooling to complete the formation of the \"mixed hydride.\"\nA solution of 77.2 g. (0.5 mole) of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone (Note 2) in 500 ml. of dry ether is then placed in the dropping funnel and slowly added to the \"mixed hydride\" solution without much cooling so that gentle refluxing is maintained (Note 3) After addition of the ketone over a period of 45\u201360 minutes the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours more to complete the reduction. The excess hydride is destroyed by the addition of 10 ml. of dry t-butanol, and the mixture is refluxed for an additional 30 minutes. 4-t-Butylcyclohexanone (3 g.) in 20 ml. of dry ether is then added to the reaction mixture, which is refluxed for 4 hours more and allowed to stand overnight (Note 4), (Note 5). The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and decomposed by successive additions of 100 ml. of water and 250 ml. of 10% aqueous sulfuric acid. The ethereal layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The extract is filtered from magnesium sulfate and the ether removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, weighing 85\u201387 g., solidifies in the flask and on gas chromatographic analysis (see (Note 5)) is found to contain 96% trans alcohol, 0.8% cis alcohol, and 3.2% ketone.\nThe crude white product is dissolved in 150 ml. of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0). On cooling, it forms a solid cake which is transferred to a Buchner funnel and rinsed with small portions of cooled petroleum ether. The yield of product, m.p. 75\u201378\u00b0 (Note 6), is 57\u201361 g. (73\u201378%). It has an approximate composition of 99.3% trans alcohol, 0.3% cis alcohol, and 0.4% ketone. A further crop of 12 g. is obtained by concentration of the mother liquor. It contains less than 1% of the cis alcohol and the ketone and is sufficiently pure for most preparative purposes (Note 7)."

(1.32 moles) of 1,2-ethanediol, 250 ml. of reagent grade benzene, and 0.05 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The flask is attached to a water separator2 under a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube. A heating mantle is placed under the flask, and the reaction mixture is refluxed until close to the theoretical amount of water (21.6 ml.) has collected in the trap; this requires about 6 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, extracted successively with 200 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution and five 100-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and distilled through a 20-cm.

A well-dried, 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a condenser to whose top is attached a calcium chloride drying tube. The flask is charged with 242 g. (1.81 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride powder and is immersed in an ice-salt bath. Anhydrous ether (25\u201350 ml.) is added dropwise through the dropping funnel, stirring is begun as soon as possible, and an additional 450\u2013475 ml. of ether is added rapidly (total volume of ether added: 500 ml.). The mixture is stirred for approximately 30 minutes and becomes a light gray solution. During this period a mixture of 16.7 g. (0.44 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride and 500 ml. of anhydrous ether is vigorously stirred in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 1). The resulting suspension is added to the ethereal aluminum chloride solution through the dropping funnel. The resulting mixture, a gray slurry, is stirred for at least 30 minutes.\nA solution of 125 g. (0.88 mole) of 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane in 200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added at a rate to cause gentle refluxing. The ice-salt bath is replaced by a steam bath, and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 3 hours. The calcium chloride drying tube is removed, and the steam bath is replaced by an ice bath. The excess hydride is carefully destroyed by adding water dropwise until hydrogen is no longer evolved; about 12 ml. of water is needed. This is followed by the more rapid addition of 1 l. of 10% sulfuric acid and then 400 ml. of water. This combination dissolves all the inorganic salts formed and results in the formation of two clear layers. The ether layer is separated in a 3-l. separatory funnel, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed successively with 200 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 200 ml. of saturated brine. The ethereal solution is dried overnight over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered through a fluted filter paper, and concentrated by distillation on a steam bath.

I.D. copper tubing surrounded by an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath (Note 2). The liquid is delivered to a 500-ml. polyethylene squeeze bottle (Note 3) containing a magnetic stirring bar via a polyethylene tube inserted through the screw cap of the bottle. The squeeze bottle is contained in a 2-l. beaker and is surrounded by powdered dry ice (Note 4). After the hydrogen fluoride is collected, the cap and delivery tube are removed, and p-cymene (terpene-free, 67 g., 0.5 mole), precooled to \u221250\u00b0 to \u221260\u00b0, just above the slush point, is added to the hydrogen fluoride. The cap and polyethylene tube assembly is now attached to deliver boron trifluoride. The delivery tube in this case dips below the surface of the hydrogen fluoride, the bottom layer. Boron trifluoride is bubbled through while the mixture is efficiently stirred with a magnetic stirrer (Note 5). A light orange color develops immediately, and the two layers become one in about 30 minutes (Note 6). Additional powdered dry ice must be added to the beaker during the boron trifluoride addition. The volume of the complex increases about 25%. After homogeneity is effected (in 30 minutes), a somewhat slower stream of boron trifluoride is added for an additional 30 minutes (Note 7). The delivery tube is replaced by a cap on the polyethylene bottle, the drying tube is removed, and the original side-arm tube is lowered to the bottom of the container. The cold reaction mixture is squirted, by squeezing the bottle, in a continuous small stream into a 4-l. beaker half-filled with cracked ice, vigorously hand-stirred. The bottle is rinsed, and the contents of the beaker are placed in a large separatory funnel. The upper colorless layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted 3 times with 50-ml. portions of hexane. The combined organic layers are washed with three 50-ml. portions of water and dried overnight with anhydrous sodium sulfate under refrigeration (Note 8). The hexane solution at this point contains m-cymene with about 8% disproportionation impurities including toluene.

            "A mixture of 400 g. of polyphosphoric acid and 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid is heated to reflux in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer. Dibenzyl ketone (42.0 g., 0.200 mole) (Note 1) is then added, and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux (130\u2013135\u00b0) for 1.5 hours. The solution is cooled to 30\u00b0 in an ice water bath, and 1 l. of water is added slowly with stirring. The brown precipitate which forms is collected by filtration, washed with 1 l. of water, and dissolved in 1 l. of hot benzene. The hot benzene solution is treated with 2 g. of activated carbon, filtered hot through a pad of diatomaceous earth, dried with 10 g. of magnesium sulfate, decanted from the magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to 500 ml. On addition of 450 ml. of hexane and cooling to 5\u201310\u00b0, tan crystals of the crude pyranone separate. Filtration affords 25\u201327 g. (45\u201349%) of product melting at 202\u2013206\u00b0. For purification this material is dissolved in 500 ml. of hot benzene, treated with 1 g. of activated carbon as before, and precipitated from solution by the addition of 250 ml. of hexane and cooling of the mixture to 5\u201310\u00b0. On filtration 19\u201321 g. (34\u201338%) of 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-diphenyl-4H-pyran-4-one is obtained. This material melts sharply at 207\u2013209\u00b0 (Note 2). An additional quantity (3\u20134 g., 5\u20137%) of somewhat less pure product (m.p. 204\u2013206\u00b0) may be recovered by evaporation of the filtrate and recrystallization of the residue from 200 ml. of benzene-hexane (50% benzene by volume)."

            "A. Nitronium tetrafluoroborate (Note 1). Caution! Hydrogen fluoride is very hazardous. Caution is also called for in the use of boron trifluoride. All operations must be carried out in a hood, and the precautions outlined in (Note 2) should be followed. A 1-l. three-necked polyolefin flask (Note 3) is provided with a short inlet tube for nitrogen, a long inlet tube for gaseous boron trifluoride, a drying tube, and a magnetic stirring bar (Note 4). The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath and flushed with dry nitrogen. Under a gentle stream of nitrogen and with stirring, the flask is charged with 400 ml. of methylene chloride, 41 ml. (65.5 g., 1.00 mole) of red fuming nitric acid (95%), and 22 ml. (22 g., 1.10 moles) of cold, liquid, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (Note 5).\nGaseous boron trifluoride (136 g., 2.00 moles) from a cylinder mounted on a scale is bubbled into the stirred, cooled reaction mixture (Note 6). The first mole is passed in rather quickly (in about 10 minutes). When approximately 1 mole has been absorbed, copious white fumes begin to appear at the exit, and the rate of flow is diminished so that it takes about 1 hour to pass in the second mole; even at this slow rate, there is considerable fuming at the exit. After all the boron trifluoride has been introduced, the mixture is allowed to stand in the cooling bath under a slow stream of nitrogen for 1.5 hours. The mixture is swirled, and the suspended product is separated from the supernatant liquid by means of a medium-porosity, sintered-glass Buchner funnel (Note 7). The gooey solid remaining in the flask is transferred to the funnel with the aid of two 50-ml. portions of nitromethane. The solid on the funnel, nitronium tetrafluoroborate, is washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of nitromethane and two 100-ml. portions of methylene chloride. In order to protect the salt from atmospheric moisture during the washing procedure, suction is always stopped while the salt is still moist. The moist salt is transferred to a round-bottomed flask and dried by evaporating the solvent (Note 8). At the end of the procedure the flask can be gently heated to 40\u201350\u00b0 (Note 9). The yield of colorless nitronium tetrafluoroborate is 85\u2013106 g. (64\u201380%) (Note 10), (Note 11), (Note 12). It is stored in a wide-mouthed polyolefin bottle with a screw cap. The edge of the cap is sealed with paraffin wax after it is screwed on.",
            "B. 3,5-Dinitro-o-tolunitrile. A 500-ml. four-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermometer and an inlet for dry nitrogen (Note 13). It is baked thoroughly by means of a Bunsen flame and allowed to cool to room temperature with a slow stream of dry nitrogen passing through it. The flask is charge, preferably in a dry box, with 335 g. of tetramethylene sulfone (Note 14) and 73.1 g. (0.55 mole) of nitronium tetrafluoroborate. The thermometer is adjusted so that the bulb is immersed in the liquid. The reaction mixture is stirred well and kept at 10\u201320\u00b0 by means of an ice bath while 58.5 g. (0.50 mole) of freshly distilled o-tolunitrile3 is added dropwise. The nitronium tetrafluoroborate only partially dissolves in the tetramethylene sulfone (Note 15), but through good stirring a homogeneous suspension can be obtained. As the dissolved nitronium salt reacts with the nitrile, more and more salt dissolves until all of it is in solution. The addition of o-tolunitrile requires 25\u201335 minutes.\nAfter the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 15 minutes at 35\u00b0. The dropping funnel is removed, 74.5 g. (0.56 mole) of nitronium tetrafluoroborate is added, and the opening of the flask is closed with a glass stopper. The well-stirred reaction mixture is heated by an electric heating mantle to 100\u00b0 in 15 minutes and kept at 100\u2013115\u00b0 for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature with continued stirring and is then poured into 800 g. of ice water. Crude 3,5-dinitro-o-tolunitrile separates on top of the aqueous mixture as a dark oil that solidifies after standing a few minutes. The solid is collected on a Buchner funnel. It is triturated on the funnel with five 50-ml. portions of cold water and with 40 ml. of ice-cold ethanol. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator, the crude nitrile weighs 75\u201384 g., m.p. 60\u201365\u00b0. Recrystallization from about 110 ml. of hot methanol gives 50\u201355 g. (48\u201353%) of 3,5-dinitro-o-tolunitrile, m.p. 82\u201384\u00b0 (Note 16)."

The red organic solution is transferred to a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask and cooled in an ice bath. While this solution is swirled, a cold solution of 50 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 25 ml. of water is slowly added. A slightly pink precipitate of diphenylcyclopropenone bisulfate gradually separates (Note 3). This is collected on a sintered-glass funnel and washed with two 100-ml. portions of methylene chloride.

The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness. The impure diphenylcyclopropenone is recrystallized by repeated extraction with boiling cyclohexane (total 1.5 l.), the solution being decanted in each case from a reddish oily impurity. On cooling, the solution deposits 29 g. of white crystals, and an additional 1 g. can be obtained by concentrating the mother liquors to 150 ml. The combined 30 g., m.p. 119\u2013120\u00b0, represents an overall yield of 44% based on dibenzylketone."

A butadiene tank is connected to the gas inlet, and about 250 ml. (160 g., 3.0 moles) of butadiene is collected in the flask (Note 4). The butadiene is cooled to dry ice temperature. The reaction vessel is immersed to the filling level shown in Fig. 1 in a slurry of dry ice and acetone. A 4-in. length of Tygon tubing is attached between the inlet of the reaction vessel and one neck of the flask containing the butadiene. The other neck of the flask is stoppered, and the flask is tipped to fill the connecting tube and the neck of the stopcock with butadiene. At the same time the stopcock is opened. The flask is shaken to ensure that the suspended Michler's ketone will be swept into the reaction vessel by the butadiene. After the vessel is filled with butadiene the stopcock is closed, the connecting tube removed, and the vessel transferred to a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen. When the butadiene is frozen, the vessel is evacuated with a high-vacuum pump and sealed off below the stopcock with a torch (Note 5). The reaction vessel is fitted with cooling water hoses and a 450-watt Hanovia medium-pressure mercury arc lamp, and then the butadiene is allowed to thaw and come to room temperature (Note 6). The mixture is irradiated for 72 hours, the water jacket dried, and the vessel weighed (Caution! (Note 6). The reaction vessel is then frozen in a Dewar flask containing a dry ice-acetone mixture, and the seal is cautiously broken. The cooling bath is removed, and the reactor is allowed to come to room temperature. The reaction mixture is removed, the vessel cleaned (Note 7), and weighed again to determine the amount of starting material. The reaction mixture is distilled and the fraction boiling between 109\u00b0 and 111\u00b0 (uncor.) is collected (Note 8). The yield is 96\u2013104 g.

A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared in a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube, and a stopper by the addition of 69.0 g. (3 moles) of sodium to 950 ml. of absolute ethanol. The solution is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 in an ice bath and stirred. The stopper is replaced by a dropping funnel, and a cold mixture (5\u201315\u00b0) of 108 g. (1.50 moles) of freshly distilled 2-butanone and 482 g. (3.30 moles) of diethyl oxalate (Note 1) is added gradually over a period of 30 minutes. After the addition is complete, the thick, orange-red mixture is allowed to warm with continued stirring to room temperature, heated under reflux for 30 minutes, and cooled again to 0\u00b0 in an ice bath. The mixture is decomposed by stirring with 165 ml. of sulfuric acid (1:1 by volume) added in portions. The sodium sulfate formed is filtered by suction and washed with ethanol (150\u2013200 ml.) (Note 2). The washings and filtrate are combined and concentrated by evaporation at room temperature for 3\u20134 days in two wide-mouthed (6-in.) 1-l. crystallizing basins (Note 3). The yellowish brown product which accumulates by slow crystallization is collected by filtration, washed with small quantities of ice-cold water, and dried in air. The crude product weighs 140\u2013150 g. Further evaporative concentration of the mother liquor followed by cooling furnishes an additional 40\u201350 g. of the keto ester, bringing the total yield to 180\u2013200 g. (53\u201359%) (Note 2). This crude material (m.p. 120\u2013130\u00b0) is used in the next step.

The trione mixed with oxalic acid separates and is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure. The dried material is extracted with boiling ether (250\u2013300 ml.) under reflux, and the ethereal extract is separated from the undissolved oxalic acid. The original aqueous filtrate is also extracted with ether in a continuous extractor. The two extracts are combined, and ether is removed by distillation.

After the appearance of a blue color a few crystals of ferric nitrate hydrate (about 0.25 g.) are added, followed by small pieces of freshly cut sodium until 25.3 g. (1.10 moles) has been added. After the sodium amide formation is complete (Note 2), the glass stopper is replaced by a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 60.0 g.

The reaction flask is immersed at least 3 in. into a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 4), and simultaneously the slow introduction of dry nitrogen through the inlet tube is begun. After the reaction mixture is thoroughly cooled (about 20 minutes), 2,4-pentanedione is added intermittently in small portions (Note 4) over 10 minutes. The cooling bath is removed.

Overall the addition requires about 20\u201330 minutes. When addition is complete, the solution is boiled under reflux for another 20 minutes. Then the solution is cooled, and 110 ml. of 2N aqueous sulfuric acid solution is added with stirring. The chloroform layer is separated and washed successively with water, 2N aqueous sodium carbonate solution, and again with water. After the chloroform solution has been dried over sodium sulfate, it is concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the residue is distilled.

(0.80 g. atom) of sodium and 500 ml. of isopropyl alcohol in a 2-l. four-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a stopper. The reflux condenser is fitted with a nitrogen-inlet line attached to a bubbler device to maintain an anhydrous atmosphere. After all the sodium has dissolved, the temperature is adjusted to 60\u201370\u00b0, the stopper is replaced by a wide-mouthed funnel, and 191 g. (0.80 mole) of 3-imino-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)-pyrazolidine is added gradually over 10 minutes to the hot solution under a blanket of nitrogen.

The solution is stirred magnetically, and 55 ml. (48 g., 0.41 mole) of isoamyl nitrite (Note 4) is added over a period of 1\u20132 minutes. A mildly exothermic reaction occurs, and the reaction mixture is maintained at 18\u201325\u00b0 and stirred for a further 1\u20131.5 hours. A transient orange to brick-red precipitate may appear (Note 5) which is slowly converted to the tan product. When the reaction is completed, the mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0, and the product is collected by suction filtration on a plastic Buchner funnel and washed on the funnel with cold tetrahydrofuran until the washings are colorless. (Caution! The filter cake should not be allowed to become dry.) The benzene-diazonium-2-carboxylate is then washed with two 50-ml. portions of 1,2-dichloroethane to displace the tetrahydrofuran, and the solvent-wet material is used in the next step (Note 6), (Note 7), and (Note 8).",

The resultant slurry is added during 3\u20135 minutes to 1250 ml. of gently boiling, stirred 1,2-dichloroethane in a 2-l. beaker on a magnetic stirrer-hot plate in the hood (Note 10). Frothing ceases a few minutes after completion of the addition, and the mixture assumes a clear red-brown color, signaling the end of the reaction.\nA 1-l., two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1-l. addition funnel and a Claisen distillation head and water-cooled condenser. The cooled reaction mixture is transferred to the funnel, and enough of it is admitted to the flask to half-fill the latter. The 1,2-dichloroethane, b.p. 83\u201384\u00b0, is distilled with the use of magnetic stirring to maintain even ebullition; the remainder of the reaction mixture is added from the funnel at a rate such that the flask remains about half-full. When ca. 75 ml. of dark residue remains in the flask, 300 ml. of ethylene glycol is added. An air condenser is substituted for the water-cooled condenser, and distillation is recommenced. A forerun, b.p. <150\u00b0, is discarded, and the fraction, b.p. 150\u2013197\u00b0, is collected (Note 11).

The inlet tube is replaced by an addition funnel containing a solution of 123 g. (1.10 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexanone (Note 2) and 81.4 g. (1.10 moles) of ethyl formate (Note 3). The solution is added rapidly, dropwise, and at the end of the addition the funnel is replaced by the nitrogen-inlet tube. After 15 minutes the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The thick suspension is filtered by suction, and the filter cake is washed with anhydrous ether, care being taken to protect the product from atmospheric moisture (Note 4). The solid salt is dried in a vacuum oven at ca. 70\u00b0, powdered (Note 5), and stored in a tightly capped bottle. Sodio-2-formyl-6-methylcyclohexanone, a cream-colored powder, is obtained in 80\u201385% (130\u2013138 g.) yield (Note 6).\nIn a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dry ice-acetone condenser and a sealed mechanical stirrer is placed 700 ml. of commercial, anhydrous, liquid ammonia. To the stirred ammonia is added a small piece of potassium metal. (Caution! Care should be exercised in handling potassium metal, since it is extremely reactive and it ignites on contact with water, atmospheric moisture, or alcohol. It should be manipulated under toluene or xylene, and blotted with filter paper before addition.) After the appearance of a blue color a few crystals of ferric nitrate hydrate (ca. 0.1 g.) are added, followed by small pieces of freshly cut potassium metal until 7.0 g. (0.18 g. atom) has been added. After all the potassium has been converted to the amide (Note 7), 24.9 g. (0.154 mole) of sodio-2-formyl-6-methylcyclohexanone is added carefully through a powder funnel (Note 8). After 1 hour a solution of 28.2 g. (0.21 mole) of n-butyl bromide (Note 9) in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise from an addition funnel. The mixture is stirred for 3 hours, and then the dry ice-acetone condenser is replaced by a water condenser. A steam bath is placed under the flask, and the ammonia is evaporated (Caution!) as 400 ml. of anhydrous ether is added. When the ammonia has been removed and the ether has refluxed for 5 minutes, 100 g. of ice is added, followed by 300 ml. of water. When the solid has dissolved, the layers are separated, and the ethereal layer is extracted twice with cold water. The combined aqueous extracts are placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and 6.4 g. of sodium hydroxide is added. The flask is warmed briefly to remove dissolved ether from the solution. The flask is equipped with an efficient condenser, and the mixture is refluxed until an enol test is no longer obtained (6\u20138 hours) (Note 10) and (Note 11). The mixture is cooled and extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

            "Anhydrous benzene (ca. 200 ml.) (Note 1) is poured into a calibrated, 500-ml., standard-taper dropping funnel equipped with a gas-inlet tube containing a fritted-glass filter; the dropping funnel is stoppered and weighed accurately. The funnel is protected with a calcium chloride tube, and 15\u201320 g. of phosgene is introduced at room temperature over a period of ca. 1 hour; this quantity corresponds to an increase in volume of 12\u201316 ml. (Note 2). The calcium chloride tube is removed, and the funnel is immediately restoppered and reweighed (Note 3). The amount of imidazole corresponding to the increase in weight observed (e.g., 16.55 g., 0.167 mole, of phosgene) is calculated on the basis of a phosgene:imidazole molar ratio of 1:4 (Note 4). The funnel is placed on a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, that contains a solution of the imidazole (here, 45.60 g., 0.669 mole) in 500 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 5) and is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a calcium chloride tube. The flask is cooled with cold water, and the solution of phosgene in benzene is added with stirring from the dropping funnel over a period of 15\u201330 minutes. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 minutes and then allowed to stand for 1 hour at room temperature. The precipitate of imidazolium chloride is removed by suction filtration with exclusion of atmospheric moisture by the use of a standard-taper fritted-glass filter funnel (Note 6). The filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath at 40\u201350\u00b0 (Note 7). The yield of colorless crystalline 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole is 80\u201394% (here, 24.8 g.; 91%). The product obtained in this way sinters at 110\u00b0 and melts between 112\u00b0 and 117\u00b0 (here, 114\u2013115\u00b0). This material can be used without further purification for most reactions, e.g., ester, peptide, and aldehyde syntheses2 (Note 8). The purity of a product of m.p. 113\u2013117\u00b0 was 98\u00b12%.3 The quality and yield of 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole are not reduced when the scale is doubled.\n1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole may be kept for a long period of time in either a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide or in a sealed tube. It is hydrolyzed by water to give carbon dioxide and imidazole."

(Note 2) directly into a 2-l., nitrogen-flushed, three-necked, Morton flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, an outlet, and a high-speed stirrer with a stainless steel propeller-type blade. The flask is charged with 89.7 g. (0.87 mole) of t-nitrobutane (Note 3) and 19.9 g. (0.87 g. atom) of sodium cut into pea-sized pieces (Note 4). The stirrer is started and initially operated at a speed just adequate to draw some of the sodium through the blade. The onset of reaction is signaled when the solution is pale lavender and the sodium surface is clearly etched and colored bright gold (Note 5). The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0 (Note 6) by directing an air blast at the sides of the flask and by controlling the rate at which sodium is drawn through the blades of the stirrer. As the reaction progresses, colorless solid is formed, and at the end of the reaction (ca. 24 hours) the reaction mixture consists of solid and a colorless glyme solution. Most of the glyme is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure at room temperature with a water bath at 20\u201325\u00b0 to leave a thick, colorless slurry. To the slurry under nitrogen (Note 7) is added 270 ml. of water, and the reddish brown organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer (Note 8) is extracted with several portions of pentane until the extract is colorless. The organic layer and pentane extracts are combined, cooled to 0\u00b0, and washed rapidly and thoroughly with two 70-ml. portions of ice-cold 0.25N hydrochloric acid to remove hydroxylamine impurities (Note 9). The pentane solution of the product is washed immediately with 70 ml. of cold water followed by 70 ml. of cold, aqueous 0.2N sodium hydroxide.

            "To a 300-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a glass Trubore stirrer and two loose-fitting ground-glass stoppers are added 46.2 g. (0.22 mole) of trifluoroacetic anhydride and 50 ml. of methylene chloride (Note 1). The stirred solution is cooled in an ice bath, and 5.40 ml. (0.20 mole) of 90% hydrogen peroxide is added from a 10-ml. graduated cylinder in ca. 1-ml. portions over a period of 10 minutes (Note 2),(Note 3), and (Note 4). When the mixture has become homogeneous, it is allowed to warm to room temperature for a few minutes and is then cooled once more in an ice bath to 0\u00b0.\nA solution of 24.2 g. (0.15 mole) of hexamethylbenzene in 300 ml. of distilled methylene chloride is prepared in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with two ice-jacketed addition funnels (Note 5) and a thermometer. The solution is cooled to 5\u00b0 in an ice-ethanol bath and is agitated by a magnetic stirrer. The cold peroxytrifluoroacetic acid solution is added at a constant rate to the hexamethylbenzene solution from one of the ice-jacketed addition funnels at the same time that 63.3 ml. of technical (48%) boron trifluoride etherate is added from the second addition funnel. The additions require ca. 45 minutes, and as far as possible they should be completed at the same time. During this period the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 (Note 6) and (Note 7).\nThe mixture is stirred at 0\u20135\u00b0 for 1 hour after addition is complete and then is hydrolyzed with 100 ml. of water, which is added quickly. The reaction mixture is extracted consecutively with two 100-ml. portions of water, three 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, one 75-ml. portion of aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide, and two 75-ml. portions of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue, a mobile yellow oil, is distilled through a 6-in. Vigreux column under reduced pressure to give pure (Note 8) 2,3,4,5,6,6-hexamethyl-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one, b.p. 85\u201387\u00b0 (1.0 mm.). The yield is 22\u201324 g.

The vessel is sealed, heated rapidly with shaking to 275\u2013280\u00b0, and maintained at this temperature for 3 hours. The vessel is allowed to cool and is opened, and the contents are poured into a 500-ml. beaker containing 200 ml. of water (Note 6). The mixture is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with water until the washings become neutral to pH paper. The combined filtrate and washings, which show a blue fluorescence, are made acid to Congo red paper with 20% aqueous sulfuric acid. The precipitate is collected by filtration, washed free of acid with water, and dried in an oven at 100\u00b0 to give ca. 9 g. of a gray solid.\nThe solid is boiled under reflux with ca. 175 ml. of benzene for 1 hour, and the benzene-insoluble material is removed from the hot mixture by filtration through a medium-grade sintered-glass funnel (Note 7). Small portions of activated alumina are added to the hot filtrate until a strong green fluorescence develops; 20\u201325 g. is needed (Note 8).

Phosphorus pentasulfide (667 g., 3.00 moles) is suspended in 600 ml. of carbon disulfide in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer with a segment-shaped paddle, an efficient reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (300 g., 3.03 moles) is added in large portions from the dropping funnel with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture warms up considerably and, after addition of about two-thirds of the amide, becomes so viscous that further stirring is impossible. The addition of the remainder is carried out without stirring at a rate such that the solution boils gently. The semisolid, yellow-brown mixture is boiled under reflux on a water bath for a further 10 hours.\nThe carbon disulfide is decanted, and 200\u2013300 ml. of water is added to the contents of the flask. Initially the mixture reacts slowly, but after some time the reaction becomes so vigorous that it is necessary to pour off the water (Note 1) and (Note 2). The addition of water, followed by its removal when the reaction becomes very vigorous, is repeated until decomposition is complete. The combined aqueous solutions are extracted several times with chloroform, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Distillation of the solvent gives a dark brown liquid residue which is distilled under reduced pressure to give 310.3 g. (89%) of the thioamide as a yellow liquid, b.p. 133\u2013135\u00b0 (12 mm.)

To this solution is added ca. 5 g. of the product as seed crystals (Note 4) to prevent initial deposition of the iodide as an oil that suddenly crystallizes with considerable evolution of heat. Methyl iodide (520 g., 3.66 moles) is then added rather rapidly. The solution becomes turbid after a short time, and separation of the salt begins with heat evolution. After 12 hours the hygroscopic, crystalline paste is filtered and dried in a desiccator; yield 663 g. (96%).\nThis product can be used without further purification.

Potassium t-butoxide (448 g., 4.0 moles) is added in one batch to this suspension with vigorous stirring. The mixture warms up a little, and later the solid becomes fine-grained and more mobile as a result of separation of potassium iodide. After being stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature, the mixture is treated with 1.8 l. of anhydrous ether and boiled under reflux on a water bath for 5 hours.\nThe flask is cooled in an ice bath, and the precipitate is filtered onto a large Buchner funnel and washed well with ether (Note 6). Ether is distilled from the yellow-brown filtrate at atmospheric pressure, and t-butyl alcohol is distilled under reduced pressure at 40\u00b0. Distillation of the residue through a 10-cm.

        "Procedure": [
            "A. 1-Methyl-3-p-tolyltriazene. p-Toluidine (50.2 g., 0.47 mole) is added to a 2-l. flask equipped with a 200-ml. dropping funnel and an efficient stirrer, and the flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath at ca. \u221210\u00b0. A solution of 46.8 g. (0.55 mole) of potassium nitrite in 150 ml. of water is placed in the dropping funnel, and a mixture of 250 g. of crushed ice and 140 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the p-toluidine with stirring. The potassium nitrite solution is slowly added with continued stirring during 1\u20132 hours until a positive starch-potassium iodide test is obtained (Note 1), and the mixture is stirred for an additional hour to ensure the reaction of all the toluidine.\nThe solution of p-toluenediazonium chloride is then brought to pH 6.8\u20137.2 at 0\u00b0 with cold, concentrated, aqueous sodium carbonate, whereupon the solution becomes red to orange in color and a small amount of red material settles out. The cold, neutral solution is transferred to a dropping funnel and added slowly to a vigorously stirred mixture of 150 g. of sodium carbonate, 300 ml. of 30\u201335% aqueous methylamine (Note 2), and 100 g. of crushed ice in a 3-l. flask. The reaction mixture is kept at ca. \u221210\u00b0 during the addition, which requires about 45 minutes (Note 3). The solution is extracted with three 1-l. portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated on a rotary evaporator at room temperature to give 65 g. of crude 1-methy1-3-p-tolyltriazene (Note 4). This is placed in a water-cooled sublimer, and the triazene is sublimed at 50\u00b0 (1 mm.) (Caution! See (Note 5)); 43.3 g. (0.29 mole, 62%) of a yellow, crystalline sublimate, m.p. 77\u201380\u00b0, is obtained (Note 6). The sublimate can be recrystallized from hexane to give the triazene as white needles, m.p. 80.5\u201381.5\u00b0. More conveniently, it is dissolved in the minimum amount of ether, and the solution is diluted with 2 volumes of hexane and cooled to 0\u00b0 to give flat plates with a slightly yellow cast; m.p. 79\u201381\u00b0. The yield of pure triazene is 33\u201337 g. (47\u201353%) (Note 7).",
            "B. Esterification of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid with 1-methyl-3-p-tolyltriazene (Note 8). A solution of 1-methyl-3-p-tolyltriazene (1.05 g., 7.0 mmoles) in 10 ml. of ether is placed in a 100-ml. flask equipped with a 100-ml. dropping funnel (Note 9). A solution of 1.50 g. (7.1 mmoles) of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid in 25 ml. of ether is placed in the dropping funnel and is slowly added to the triazene solution; the contents of the flask are gently swirled from time to time. During the addition, nitrogen is evolved, and the solution becomes red in color. After the nitrogen evolution has ceased (ca. 1 hour), the ethereal solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with 5N hydrochloric acid to remove toluidine (Note 10). It is then washed with 5% aqueous sodium carbonate and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the ether yields methyl 3,5-dinitrobenzoate (1.11\u20131.42 g., 70\u201390%) as light tan crystals, m.p. 106\u2013107.5\u00b0 (Note 11). Recrystallization from ether yields small, flat plates, m.p. 107\u2013107.5\u00b0."

            "A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a reflux condenser connected to a dry ice-trichloroethylene trap (Note 1) that is followed by a water trap to measure carbon dioxide evolution (Note 2). The flask is charged with 65.6 g. (0.250 mole) of triphenylphosphine (Note 3) and 43.5 g. (0.250 mole) of \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifluoroacetophenone (Note 4) in 200 ml. of dry diglyme (Note 5). The solution is heated to a bath temperature of 140\u00b0 under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the nitrogen-inlet tube is replaced by a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (Note 6) containing a solution of 76.2 g. (0.500 mole) of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate (Note 7) in 150 ml. of dry diglyme. The solution of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is added dropwise over a period of 1 hour (Note 8), and the reaction mixture is heated for an additional hour at 130\u2013140\u00b0 to ensure complete decarboxylation of the salt (Note 9). The colors of the reaction mixture are characteristic of ylid reactions, changing from a creamy white to a creamy orange and finally to a deep brown.\nThe reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature under nitrogen. The cool mixture is steam distilled until 2 l. of distillate has been collected. The lower, organic layer is separated from the distillate, washed with cold water (Note 10) to remove diglyme, and dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate. Fractional distillation gives 26\u201331 g. (50\u201360%) of 2-phenylperfluoropropene, b.p. 58\u201359\u00b0 (54 mm.), n20D 1.4225 (Note 11) and (Note 12)."

A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer that can be immersed in the contents of the flask. There is added to the flask 500 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol (Note 1) followed by 17.5 g. (0.76 g. atom) of sodium, which is added carefully in small portions. When a clear solution has been obtained, 55.0 g. (0.75 mole) of acetone oxime is added (Note 2). The flask is cooled in a water bath held at 5\u201310\u00b0, the stirrer is started, and 136 g. (0.75 mole) of ethyl \u03b1-bromopropionate (Note 3) is added during 20\u201330 minutes at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above 20\u00b0. The cooling bath is removed, and the stirring is continued until the contents of the flask reach room temperature.\nAfter standing for 12 hours, the reaction mixture is filtered by gravity into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the solid sodium bromide is washed with 50 ml. of ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to a volume of about 400 ml., and 250 ml. of water is added to the cooled concentrate. The mixture is extracted with 50 ml. of a 1:1 mixture of ether and benzene, and the aqueous layer is reextracted with 100 ml. of the same solvent mixture. The organic extracts are combined, washed with 100 ml. of water and 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and filtered through a few grams of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled to yield 71\u201377 g. (55\u201359%) of ethyl \u03b1-(isopropylideneaminooxy)propionate, b.p. 62\u201364\u00b0 (4 mm.).",

In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer and a thermometer that can be immersed in the contents of the flask is placed 300 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.37 mole). The flask is heated on a water bath until the temperature of the solution reaches 70\u00b0, and 52 g. (0.30 mole) of ethyl \u03b1-(isopropylideneaminooxy)propionate is added. The mixture is stirred rapidly while the temperature is held at 70\u00b0; the stirring is continued for 20 minutes beyond the time necessary for the contents of the flask to become homogeneous (Note 4). The solution is cooled and acidified to Congo red paper with 5N hydrochloric acid, and 175 g. of ammonium sulfate is added. The mixture is extracted three times with a total of 300 ml. of a 1:1 mixture of ether and benzene. The combined extracts are dried rapidly over 5 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered (Note 5). The solvent is removed by distillation, and 160 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) is added to the cooled residue. The resulting solution is placed in a refrigerator for several hours.

The solid mass of crystals is filtered by suction, and the funnel is covered with a rubber dam to remove most of the solvent. The solid product is placed in a 500-ml. beaker, 250 ml. of ethyl acetate is added (Note 11), and the mixture is heated until all the solid has dissolved.

The flask is fitted with an air condenser (Note 15), and the contents are heated under reflux so that the condensing liquid nearly reaches the top of the condenser (Note 16). After 2 hours, 18 ml. of water is added to the hot solution, and crystallization is allowed to take place slowly, first at room temperature and finally for 12 hours in a refrigerator. The yellow crystalline acid is filtered and dissolved in 70 ml. of hot acetic acid.

(2.00 moles) of 3-hydroxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-3-pentenoic acid \u03b2-lactone2 is placed in a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer (Note 2), a coarse fritted-glass gas-dispersion thimble, a thermometer immersed in the liquid, and an air-cooled reflux condenser (Note 3). The outlet of the condenser is connected to a bubble counter filled with concentrated sulfuric acid; this in turn is vented to the atmosphere through a water scrubber. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and stirring is started. When the temperature of the mixture is about 10\u00b0, anhydrous hydrogen chloride is introduced through the gas-dispersion tube at such a rate that a slow stream of bubbles escapes through the bubble counter. Gas absorption is slow at first, but after a few minutes the zinc chloride dissolves and the rate of gas absorption increases sharply. The temperature rises rapidly to 50\u201370\u00b0 at the same time (Note 4). After about 10 minutes the temperature falls and the rate of gas absorption decreases. The ice bath is revmoed, and the addition of hydrogen chloride is continued for 30 minutes.\nThe reaction mixture is distilled rapidly under reduced pressure through a short Vigreux column (Note 5). The yield of crude product, b.p. 50\u201380\u00b0 (5\u201310 mm.), n20D 1.4410\u20131.4416, is 310\u2013330 g. (88\u201393%). This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 6). Fractionation through a 1 \u00d7 36-in. column packed with 8 \u00d7 8-mm. glass helices gives, after removal of a small amount of forerun, pure 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-oxovaleryl chloride, b.p. 86\u00b0 (23 mm.), n20D 1.4418."

In a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a constant-pressure dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser is placed 174 g. (1.0 mole) of ethyl azodicarboxylate2 in 150 ml. of ether. Freshly prepared cyclopentadiene3 (70 g., 1.06 moles) is added dropwise over a 1-hour period to the stirred ethereal solution of diethyl azodicarboxylate. During the addition a gentle reflux is maintained by external cooling with an ice-water bath as needed. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for 4 hours, or less if the yellow color of the azodicarboxylic acid ester disappears. The dropping funnel and condenser are replaced by a glass stopper and a short distillation head, respectively. The ether and unreacted diene are distilled off on a steam bath and the residue is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed boiling flask equipped with a 30-cm. Vigreux column. After a small forerun the diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate distills to give 218\u2013228 g.

(0.47 mole) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate and 125 ml. of absolute ethanol is placed in a standard Paar bottle along with 0.2 g. of 5% palladium on carbon catalyst (Note 1). The bottle is attached to the Paar hydrogenation apparatus, and shaking is begun using an initial pressure of 60 p.s.i. After 2 hours, hydrogen uptake ceases. The mixture is gravity-filtered twice and the ethanol is removed using a rotary evaporator. The entire procedure is repeated on a second batch and the crude product from the combined runs is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed boiling flask fitted with a 15-cm. Vigreux column. Fractional distillation gives 218\u2013223 g. (95\u201397%) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate, b.p. 107\u2013108\u00b0 (0.05 mm.), n22D = 1.4730.",
            "C. 2,3-Diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. A slow stream of nitrogen is bubbled through 1.2 l. of ethylene glycol (Note 2) for 20 minutes in a mechanically stirred 2-l. three-necked flask with mild heating (Note 3). The gas inlet tube is replaced with a condenser and a thermometer which reaches below the level of the ethylene glycol, and 275 g. (4.2 moles) of reagent grade potassium hydroxide pellets (85% pure) is added in four portions. A constant-pressure dropping funnel containing 223 g. (0.92 moles) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate is connected and the reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen. The ethylene glycol solution is heated to 125\u00b0 and the diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate is added as rapidly as is permitted by its viscous nature. The heating source is removed whenever the reaction temperature approaches 130\u00b0. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 125\u00b0 for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and then poured slowly into a 4-l. beaker which contains 1 kg. each of ice and water and 450 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Caution. Vigorous foaming occurs) (Note 4). When the acidification is complete, the reaction mixture is warmed to about 40\u00b0 and neutralized with 5N ammonium hydroxide. Half of this neutral solution is transferred to a second 4-l. beaker and subsequent operations are carried out on both batches.\nThe solution is stirred slowly and ca. 25 ml. of 2N cupric chloride solution is added slowly. The blue-green color of the cupric chloride is rapidly discharged and a brick red coloration occurs, followed by the precipitation of voluminous bright red crystals of the cuprous chelate of 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. The pH is adjusted to 5\u20136 by the addition of 5N ammonium hydroxide. Addition of 25 ml. of the cupric chloride solution followed by neutralization of the generated hydrochloric acid with 5N ammonium hydroxide is repeated five times. The precipitate is collected by filtration and the filtrate is again treated with 25-ml. portions of cupric chloride solution and 5N ammonium hydroxide. The procedure is repeated until the filtrate is clear red at pH 3\u20134 and returns to a cloudy green at pH 6 with no further formation of precipitate (Note 5).\nThe combined precipitate from the two batches is carefully washed with 500 ml. of 20% ammonium chloride solution, two 400-ml. portions of 95% ethanol, and two 300-ml. portions of cold water. The product is sucked as dry as possible in the suction funnel.\nThe damp product is broken up and transferred to a 1-l. flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and 400 ml. of water. A cold solution of 60 g. of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water is added slowly with magnetic stirring. The stirred yellow-orange suspension is then continuously extracted with 700 ml. of pentane for 48 hours.\nThe pentane extract is dried over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. After removal of the drying agent by filtration, the pentane is slowly removed from the product by distillation through a 20-cm. Hempel column packed with glass helices (Note 6). When the pentane is removed, a white crystalline residue remains which weighs 78\u201383 g. (88\u201394% yield based on the hydrogenated Diels-Alder adduct). This 2,3-diazabicyclo [2.2.1]hept-2-ene melts at 98.0\u201399.5\u00b0 (Note 7).",
            "D. Bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane. Finely powdered 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (83 g., crude product from above) is placed in a 500-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask. The flask is heated at 130\u2013140\u00b0 in an oil bath to completely remove any traces of pentane. A 25-cm. unpacked Hempel column is installed and connected directly to a 100-ml. receiver flask having a side arm to which is attached a drying tube packed with silica gel. The receiver is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The azobicyclic is pyrolyzed by heating the oil bath to 180\u2013195\u00b0. At the preferred rate of pyrolysis, the starting material condenses about one fourth of the way up the column. Occasional flaming of the column may be necessary to prevent plugging of the column by the solidifying starting material. At the end of the pyrolysis (8 hours) only a small, black, nonvolatile residue remains: The condensed bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane is allowed to warm to room temperature, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the drying agent removed by filtration through glass wool into a 100-ml. distillation flask. (Caution! Bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane is a very volatile hydrocarbon and requires appropriate handling for high yields.) Distillation leaves a residue of about 1 g. of the starting azobicyclic and affords 53.5\u201355.5 g. (90.0\u201393.5%) of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, b.p. 45.5\u00b0, n20D 1.4220 (Note 8)."

The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath and 88 g. of bromine is added dropwise over a period of 20\u201330 minutes (Note 4). After the addition of the bromine (Note 5) is complete, the ice bath is removed and 72 g. (0.50 mole) of \u03b2-naphthol (Note 6) in 100 ml. of acetonitrile (Note 7) is added in one portion and the reaction mixture is heated to 60\u201370\u00b0 for at least 30 minutes (Note 8). The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, stirring is discontinued, and the acetonitrile is distilled (Note 9) under aspirator pressure until the oil bath temperature reaches 110\u00b0 (Note 10). After all the acetonitrile has been removed, the condenser is replaced by a short, large glass tube (Note 11) connected to a 500-ml. flask half-filled with water, and the oil bath is replaced by a Wood's metal bath. The bath temperature is now raised to 200\u2013220\u00b0 and kept at this temperature until all the solid has melted (Note 12). The mixture is stirred and the bath temperature is raised to 340\u00b0 (Note 13) and held at this temperature until evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases (approximately 20\u201330 minutes). The Wood's metal bath is removed and the reaction mixture is cooled to approximately 100\u00b0 and then poured into a 1-l. beaker and cooled to room temperature. Pentane (300 ml.)

The petroleum ether is distilled from the solution, heated in a water bath, through a 60-cm. Vigreux column, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction, b.p. 64\u201365\u00b0 (1.0 mm.) or 132\u2013134\u00b0 (35 mm.), is collected as 39.5\u201352.0 g. (64\u201385%) of colorless liquid, n25D 1.4846\u20131.4850. This distillation fraction contains (Note 6) 80\u201390% of the cis-cyclododecene (51\u201376%) accompanied by 10\u201320% of a mixture of cyclododecane and cis,trans-1,5-cyclododecadiene (Note 7). If desired, the cis-cyclododecene may be further purified by preparative chromatography or separation of the silver nitrate-olefin addition complex (Note 8)."

            "A. 9,9-Dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane. A dry 3-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a glass stopper, stirrer, and condenser. The flask is kept under a positive nitrogen pressure by means of a gas-trap arrangement connected to the top of the condenser (Note 1). The flask is quickly charged with 2 l. of anhydrous t-butyl alcohol (Note 2) and 73 g. (1.87 g. atoms) of potassium metal. (Caution! See earlier volume2 for handling of this metal.) The flow of nitrogen is stopped and the mixture is stirred and boiled under reflux until the potassium has reacted, hydrogen being liberated through the trap. The condenser is arranged for distillation by means of an adapter. The glass stopper is replaced by a pressure-equalized dropping funnel with the nitrogen inlet connected to the top. About 1.5 l. of t-butyl alcohol (Note 3) is then distilled into a predried flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen. A water pump is then connected, the nitrogen inlet is closed, and the distillation is continued under reduced pressure while the three-necked flask is gradually heated to 150\u00b0 in an oil bath. Finally, the water pump is replaced by an oil pump and the white remaining solid is heated at 150\u00b0 under a pressure of 0.1\u20131 mm. for 2 hours. The connection to the vacuum system is closed, the oil bath removed, and nitrogen again introduced. The condenser with adapter is replaced by a glass stopper, and the flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath.\nFreshly distilled cis-cyclooctene, 178 g. (214 ml., 1.62 moles) (Note 4) and 200 ml. of sodium-dried pentane (Note 5) are introduced to the flask, and the dropping funnel is charged with 420 g. (148 ml., 1.66 moles) of bromoform (Note 6). The bromoform is added dropwise to the stirred slurry over a period of 6\u20137 hours, the color of the reaction mixture changing gradually from light yellow to brown. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and left stirring overnight. Water (400 ml.) is added to the reaction mixture followed by enough 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid to neutralize the slightly basic solution. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined pentane solutions are washed with three 50-ml. portions of water. The pentane solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and stripped of solvent on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue yields 237\u2013299 g. (52\u201365%) of 9,9-dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane, b.p. 62\u00b0 (0.04 mm.), n23D 1.5493\u20131.5507 (Note 7).",

A dry 2-l. three-necked flask is equipped with mechanical stirrer, pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet tube connected to a gas-trap arrangement (Note 1). To the flask are added 187 g. (116 ml., 0.66 mole) of 9,9-dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane and 100 ml. of anhydrous ether. The dropping funnel is charged with 450 ml. of 1.9M ether solution of methyllithium (0.85 mole) (Note 8). The flask is cooled by means of an acetone-dry ice bath maintained at \u221230\u00b0 to \u221240\u00b0, and the methyllithium is added dropwise with stirring during 1 hour (Note 9). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, and excess lithium reagent is decomposed by dropwise addition of 100 ml. of water. An additional 400 ml. of water is then added, and the ether layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 30-ml. portions of water until neutral and dried over magnesium sulfate. The latter is filtered and the ether is distilled through a 40-cm Vigreux column.

        "Procedure": [
            "Caution! Since hydrogen is liberated in the first step of this reaction, it should be conducted in a hood. A dry 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a Trubore mechanical stirrer, an Allihn condenser, and a 1-l. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, the top of which is fitted with a gas inlet tube. After 40.0 g. (1.64 g. atoms) of clean, dry magnesium ribbon (Note 1) has been placed in the flask, the system is flushed with nitrogen and 600 ml. of anhydrous methanol (Note 2) is added. As soon as the vigorous reaction begins, the nitrogen flow is stopped; if necessary, the reaction may be moderated by external cooling with wet towels. When the hydrogen evolution has ceased, a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the reaction system and the condenser is replaced by a total condensation-partial take-off distillation head. The nitrogen flow is stopped, and the bulk of the methanol is distilled from the solution under reduced pressure (Note 3) with stirring while the reaction flask is heated to 50\u201355\u00b0 with a water bath. This distillation is stopped when stirring of the pasty suspension of magnesium methoxide is no longer practical. Nitrogen is readmitted to the system, and the outlet from the distillation head is attached to a small trap containing mineral oil so that the volume of gas escaping from the reaction system can be estimated. Anhydrous dimethylformamide (700 ml.; (Note 4)) is added to the reaction flask, and the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously while a stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide (Note 5) is passed into the reaction vessel through the gas inlet tube attached to the dropping funnel. The dissolution of the carbon dioxide is accompanied by an exothermic reaction with the suspended magnesium methoxide to form a solution. When the absorption of carbon dioxide has stopped (Note 6), the colorless solution is heated with a mantle under a slow stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide gas until the temperature of the liquid distilling from the flask reaches 140\u00b0, indicating that the residual methanol has been removed from the reaction mixture. The flow of carbon dioxide is stopped, and a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the system while the resulting solution (Note 7) is cooled below 100\u00b0 with a water bath. Cyclohexanone (20.0 g., 0.204 mole) (Note 8) is added to the reaction mixture, and the solution is heated under reflux for 2 hours while a slow stream of nitrogen (2\u20133 bubbles per second) is passed over the reaction mixture. The resulting solution is cooled first to room temperature with a water bath and then to \u22125\u00b0 with a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 9).\nMeanwhile, 700 ml. of anhydrous methanol is placed in a 2-l. flask fitted with a gas inlet tube extending approximately 5 mm. below the surface of the methanol and a calcium chloride tube to protect the contents of the flask from atmospheric moisture. The methanol is cooled with an external cooling bath prepared from ice and calcium chloride (Note 10) and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride (Note 10) (290\u2013300 g. of hydrogen chloride is required). This solution is transferred to the dropping funnel by means of a gooseneck adapter and the methanolic hydrogen chloride solution is then added, dropwise and with stirring, to the reaction flask, the temperature of the reaction being maintained at 0\u00b0 \u00b1 5\u00b0 by means of a cooling bath. This addition is accompanied by the vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide and the separation of a white solid. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and then the bulk of the methanol is removed from the solution by distillation under reduced pressure with stirring. During the distillation the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 55\u00b0. The remaining suspension is poured into a 4-l. beaker containing 1 kg. of crushed ice. The crude product separates as shiny white flakes which are collected on a filter and washed with water. A small second crop of the crude material may be obtained by cooling the aqueous filtrates to 0\u00b0 overnight. The total crude product (25\u201326 g.) is dissolved in 250 ml. of boiling methanol, and this solution is concentrated to 125\u2013150 ml. and allowed to cool. The keto diester separates as flat white needles, m.p. 128\u2013132\u00b0 (Note 11), yield 19.3\u201319.7 g. (44\u201345%). Concentration of the mother liquors affords an additional 2.2\u2013 2.5 g. of crude product, m.p. 122\u2013128\u00b0 (Note 11)."

            "A dry 1-l. round-bottomed flask with five outlets is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a reflux condenser attached to a calcium chloride tube, an inlet for dry nitrogen (a weak stream of which is maintained through all the reaction until the hydrolysis step), and a thermometer reaching close to the bottom. In the flask are placed 9.0 g. (0.38 g. atom) of magnesium turnings, a crystal of iodine, and about 25 ml. of dry ether. With stirring, about 15 ml. of a solution of 88.5 g. (0.38 mole) of p-dibromobenzene (Note 1) in 500 ml. of dry ether (Note 2) is added at once. When the reaction has started, the remaining ether solution is added at a rate which maintains rapid refluxing. After the p-dibromobenzene has been added, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours.\nThe mixture is then cooled by means of an ice-sodium chloride bath. When the internal temperatures has reached \u22127\u00b0, a solution of 71.8 g. (0.33 mole) of chlorodiphenylphosphine (Note 3) in 100 ml. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed +10\u00b0. The addition requires about 1.25 hours. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring continued for 1.5 hours. The flask is then again immersed in an icesodium chloride bath, and 150 ml. of a cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added slowly. The ether is decanted and the remainder acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with 125 ml. of benzene each (Note 4). From the combined ether and benzene solutions, the solvents are evaporated and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. After the low-boiling material, some p-dibromobenzene distills and crystallizes in the distillation bridge. At 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 mm., heating is continued until the phosphine reaches the stillhead. At this stage the distillation is interrupted, the stillhead and condenser containing p-dibromobenzene replaced by a clean, short distillation bridge without condenser, and the phosphine distilled at 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 to 10\u22123 mm., no forerun being taken (Note 5). The main bulk distills at 180\u2013185\u00b0 (2 \u00d7 10\u22122 mm.). The colorless, oily distillate begins to crystallize in the receiving flask during or shortly after the distillation (Note 6) and weighs 81\u201383 g. (73\u201377% yield) (Note 7), m.p. 64\u201371\u00b0. This material is sufficiently pure for further reactions, e.g., Grignard reaction. A sample may be recrystallized from methanol to give colorless needles, m.p. 79\u201380\u00b0."

(0.5 mole) of freshly distilled aniline in 250 ml. of anhydrous benzene contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, with swirling and occasional cooling in an ice bath (if necessary). An immediate precipitation of aniline hydrochloride occurs. After the addition of the thionyl chloride solution is complete, the mixture is heated to reflux, protected from moisture, on a heating mantle until a clear solution is obtained (2\u20135 hours). The solvent and excess thionyl chloride are evaporated under reduced pressure (Note 3) at 50\u00b0 and the residual brownish yellow liquid is distilled under vacuum to yield 63\u201365 g. (91\u201394%) of yellow N-sulfinylaniline, b.p. 88\u201395\u00b0 (17\u201320 mm.), n21D 1.6253.",

When the temperature of the solution reaches \u22122\u00b0, stirring is started and a stream of chlorine gas (Note 9) is passed through at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 2\u00b0. After 1 hour the passage of chlorine is stopped and the greenish yellow solution is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is then connected to an aspirator to remove most of the dissolved chlorine. The light yellow solution thus obtained is stripped of the solvent at 40\u00b0 under reduced pressure (Note 3). The almost colorless residual liquid is dissolved in 150 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40\u201360\u00b0) and cooled, with scratching, in a dry ice-acetone bath, whereupon a colorless crystalline solid starts separating. The cooling is continued for 30 minutes and the solid is then filtered, washed with 50 ml. of cold petroleum ether (b.p. 40\u201360\u00b0), pressed to remove most of the adhering mother liquor, and dried over a filter paper. The yield of benzohydroxamoyl chloride, m.p. 48\u201352\u00b0, which is pure enough (Note 10) for the next step, is 33\u201338 g. (51\u201359%).",

The mixture is then heated to reflux, protected from moisture, in a temperature-controlled oil bath for 3\u20135 hours. Continuous evolution of sulfur dioxide takes place during this period at the end of which the mixture is cooled and evaporated under reduced pressure (Note 3) at 70\u201380\u00b0 to remove the solvent. The residual dark brown liquid is transferred to a 50-ml., pear-shaped distilling flask (Note 13) and heated, protected from moisture, at 110\u00b0 for 30 minutes to complete the decomposition.

The mixture is heated to reflux until the boiling becomes spontaneous. An additional 600 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added with more of the bromide to maintain a vigorous reflux, until 237.4 g. (1 mole) of 6-bromo-2-methoxy-naphthalene has been added. After the spontaneous reflux has subsided, the dark solution is heated to reflux for 20minutes.\nA 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a paddle stirrer, a Claisen adapter containing a thermometer well and nitrogen inlet, and a dropping funnel is flame-dried and placed under nitrogen. Into the flask are introduced 125 ml. (1.1 mole) of trimethyl borate (Note 3) and 600 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. This solution is cooled to \u221210\u00b0 with an all-encompassing ice-salt bath or a dry ice-carbon tetrachloride bath. The dropping funnel is charged with the Grignard solution which is added over 30 minutes to the borate solution while stirring rapidly and maintaining the temperature between \u221210\u00b0 and \u22125\u00b0. A white sludge separates from the solution during the addition. After stirring for an additional 15 minutes, 86 ml. (1.5 mole) of chilled acetic acid (Note 4) is added all at once. This is followed by the addition of a cold solution of 112 ml. (1.1 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 100 ml. of water, dropwise over 15 minutes, while maintaining the temperature below 0\u00b0 (Note 5) and stirring vigorously.\nThe mixture is allowed to warm up over 20 minutes and is poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel. The purplish solution is washed with a saturated ammonium sulfate solution (about 1.5 l) containing ferrous ammonium sulfate until the rust-brown ferric color is no longer produced. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated, leaving a dark solid. Purification of the solid by high-vacuum short path distillation gives 127\u2013142 g.

To the hot solution is added, cautiously to avoid foaming, 25.0 g. (26.2 ml., 0.206 mole) of racemic \u03b1-phenylethylamine (Note 1) and the resulting solution is allowed to cool. Since crystallization occurs slowly, the solution should be allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 24 hours. The (\u2212)-amine (+)-hydrogen tartrate salt separates as white prismatic crystals (Note 2). The product (18.1\u201319.3 g.) should be collected on a filter and washed with a small volume of methanol. The combined mother liquor and methanol washings should be concentrated to a volume of 175 ml. with a rotary evaporator. The resulting mixture is then heated to boiling, and the solution is allowed to cool and stand at room temperature for approximately 24 hours. In this way an additional crop (2.0\u20133.8 g.) of the (\u2212)-amine (+)-hydrogen tartrate salt may be separated as white prisms (Note 2). The combined methanolic mother liquors and washings from these crystallizations are concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The crude residual salt is used for the preparation of the (+)-amine.\nThe combined crops of crude (\u2212)-amine (+)-hydrogen tartrate are pulverized in a mortar and redissolved in 450\u2013500 ml. of boiling methanol. The resulting hot solution is concentrated to 350 ml. (Note 3) and then allowed to cool and stand for 24 hours. After the initial crop (14.3\u201316.2 g.) of pure (\u2212)-amine (+)-hydrogen tartrate has been collected as white prisms (Note 2) (m.p. 179\u2013182\u00b0 dec.), the mother liquors and washings are concentrated to 75 ml. and again allowed to stand for 24 hours. In this way a second crop (2.9\u20133.6 g.) of the pure (\u2212)-amine salt is obtained. The total yield of the pure (\u2212)-amine salt is 17.9\u201319.1 g.

After the combined ether extracts have been washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over magnesium sulfate, the bulk of the ether is distilled from the mixture through a 30-cm.

After the resulting mixture has been extracted with ether, the extract is dried, concentrated, and distilled as previously described. The recovered amine amounts to 12.5\u201314.1 g. of colorless liquid, b.p. 79\u201380\u00b0 (18 mm.), [\u03b1]28D +23.8 to +24.7\u00b0 (neat). From the weight and specific rotation data for this amine sample and the reported2 specific rotation, [\u03b1]25D +40.6\u00b0 (neat), for the pure (+)-amine, the amount of excess (+)-amine present in the recovered amine sample is calculated. Typical values range from 0.06 to 0.07 mole of excess (+)-amine. A solution of this partially resolved amine in 90 ml. of 95% ethanol is heated to boiling and then treated with 180 ml. of an ethanolic solution containing a sufficient amount (0.03\u20130.035 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid to convert the excess (+)-amine to its neutral sulfate salt (Note 6). The hot solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the crude (+)-amine sulfate which separates as white needles (7.8\u20139.3 g.) is collected on a filter and washed with 95% ethanol. The combined ethanolic mother liquors and washings are concentrated and allowed to cool to separate a second crop (1.2\u20131.4 g.) of the crude (+)-amine sulfate. The combined crops of (+)-amine sulfate are dissolved in a minimum volume (about 45 ml. of hot water), and the resulting hot solution is diluted with acetone until it is just saturated at the boiling point. After the solution has been allowed to cool to room temperature, the pure (+)-amine sulfate which separates as white needles, m.p. 240\u2013265\u00b0 dec. (5.0\u20136.1 g.) is collected on a filter and washed with cold 95% ethanol. The combined mother liquors and washings are concentrated to dryness, and the residual solid is recrystallized from aqueous acetone to separate additional crops (2.6\u20132.8 g.) of the pure (+)-amine sulfate. The total yield of the pure amine sulfate is 7.8\u20138.9 g.

The combined ether extracts are washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation of the ether through a 30-cm. Vigreux column. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to separate 5.1\u20135.5 g.

After the flask has been flushed with nitrogen for 30 minutes, the mixture is warmed in a water bath to about 80\u00b0 (Note 4) with stirring for 30 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere to initiate reaction. Then the mixture is stirred at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere for an additional 30 hours, at which time the originally green reaction mixture has been converted to a clear, deep blue solution. While a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained over the reaction solution, the mechanical stirrer is removed and replaced with a nitrogen outlet (Note 5). The third neck of the reaction flask is fitted with a short adapter closed with a rubber septum (Note 6).\nThe solution is standardized by withdrawing 5.0-ml. aliquots into a hypodermic syringe (Note 6) fitted with a relatively wide-bore needle and flushed with nitrogen before use. The aliquots are quenched by injecting them into 10 ml. of aqueous 1M ferric chloride solution in an Erlenmeyer flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 2 minutes the flow of nitrogen is stopped, and the resulting solution is diluted with 50 ml. of water and titrated with 0.1N ceric sulfate to the ferrous ion-phenanthroline end point (Note 7).

The resulting solution is diluted with 100 ml. of water and 30 g. of ammonium sulfate is added. The mixture is shaken with four 150-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed with three 50-ml. portions of water and then dried over magnesium sulfate.

The flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath and the stirrer is started. When the temperature is about \u22124\u00b0, 21 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added from a buret at the rate of 3\u20135 ml. of per minute. The rate is adjusted to keep the temperature at 10\u201312\u00b0 (Note 3). Near the end of the addition, the color of the reaction mixture changes from dark amber to pale yellow. When all the peroxide has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred with efficient cooling for 3\u20134 minutes. Without delay the solution is then poured slowly, with very rapid stirring, into a mixture of 500 ml. of water and approximately 250 g. of crushed ice contained in 2-l. beaker (Note 4). The solid is filtered rapidly by suction through a coarse, sintered-glass funnel and washed with 200 ml. of ice water. For best results the product is dried on the funnel with continuous suction for 3\u20134 hours and recrystallized from 1,2-dichloroethane (10 ml. per g.) (Note 5). The yield of nearly colorless needles melting at 177\u2013178\u00b0 (sealed capillary) is 17.1\u201319.6 g. (59\u201368%) (Note 6). The infrared spectrum of the oxide (Nujol mull) is simple and useful in product identification.

(3.7 mole) of sodium bicarbonate, and 250 ml. of water. The temperature of the solution is maintained at 18\u201322\u00b0 using an ice bath while 320 ml. (3.4 mole) of dimethyl sulfate (Note 2) is added with stirring over a 30- to 50-minute period. Carbon dioxide is evolved vigorously and a transient purple color is developed; it changes to a brown tinge later on.\nWhen the addition of dimethyl sulfate is complete, stirring is continued for 1 hour at 20\u201325\u00b0. Then the temperature is raised to 60\u201365\u00b0 during 10 minutes (Note 3) and is kept at this value until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases. After the addition of 250 ml. of cold water, the reaction flask is cooled rapidly in an ice bath and 100 ml. of ethanolamine (Note 4) is added. The resultant crystalline slurry is removed from the flask, and the apparatus is rearranged as indicated in (Note 5), using an upright condenser between the dropping funnel (Note 6) and the receiving flask.\nTo the reaction flask is added 200 ml. of ethanolamine, and it is heated to 140\u00b0 with stirring. The slurry above is added in moderate portions over a 40- to 50-minute period (Note 7). When the heating bath is maintained at 230\u2013240\u00b0, the addition of the slurry should provide an inner temperature at 120\u2013140\u00b0 as the water and oily product distill. After the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is rinsed with 100\u2013150 ml. of water. As soon as the inner temperature has reached 160\u00b0, 50 ml. of ethanolamine is added and the temperature is maintained at 160\u2013170\u00b0 for 20 minutes. Water (50 ml.) is added through the dropping funnel to initiate a rapid steam distillation. Steam distillation is continued by the addition of 50-ml. portions of water at an inner temperature of 120\u2013140\u00b0 and a bath temperature of 230\u2013240\u00b0 until no more oil appears in the distillate (Note 8).\nThe oily product solidifies on cooling to about 20\u00b0, forming white lumps. After filtration by suction, the lumps are crushed, filtered, and washed four times with 50-ml. portions of ice water. Drying over silica gel in a vacuum gives 62\u201372 g.

(2.05 moles) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (Note 1) in 100 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise, with stirring, over a period of 45 minutes. After a few minutes the solution becomes clear and, after about one-half of the isocyanate has been added, the carboxylic acid amide N-sulfonyl chloride begins to precipitate. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture is heated for an hour to complete the evolution of carbon dioxide (Note 2). N,N-Dimethylformamide (300 g., 4.11 moles) (Note 3) is added, with stirring, over a 15-minute period, while cooling with ice to an internal temperature of 15\u201320\u00b0. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 minutes and then poured onto ca. 800 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, the resulting layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted once with 100 ml. of dichloromethane.

One lead of the T-piece is connected to a nitrogen supply and the other to a gas bubbler. cis-3,4-Dichlorocyclobutene [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 422 (1988)], 20 g. (0.16 mole), and 125 ml. of anhydrous benzene are added to the flask, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. Diiron nonacarbonyl, 25 g. (Note 1) is then added, the flow of N2 is stopped, and the mixture is heated to 50\u201355\u00b0, with stirring. After about 15 minutes the initial rapid evolution of carbon monoxide becomes greatly diminished and an additional 8 g. of the nonacarbonyl is added; additional 8-g. quantities are added at intervals (approximately 15 minutes), governed by the rate of carbon monoxide evolution. The addition is continued until no more carbon monoxide is liberated (Note 2), and the reaction mixture is stirred at 50\u00b0 for an additional hour. Approximately 140 g. of diiron nonacarbonyl is required for the complete conversion of the dichlorocyclobutene, the total reaction time being about 6 hours.\nThe contents of the flask are then filtered with suction through Filtercel and the residue, while kept in the Buchner funnel, is thoroughly washed with pentane until the washings are colorless (Note 3). The pentane and much of the benzene are evaporated from the combined filtrates with a water aspirator.\nThe residual liquid is transferred to a flask equipped with an efficient fractionating column and distilled under reduced pressure. Benzene is removed first, followed by considerable quantities of iron pentacarbonyl (b.p. 20\u00b0, 30 mm.); when the diiron nonacarbonyl has been removed, the pressure is reduced further and cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl2 is collected as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 47\u00b0 (3 mm.), yielding 13.8\u201314.4 g.

            "Dry chlorine gas is admitted into a solution of 104 g. (1.00 mole) of cyclo\u00f6ctatetraene in 150 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride contained in a tared, 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a gas-inlet tube, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is maintained between \u221228\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 throughout the addition, which is terminated after 71 g. (1.0 mole) of chlorine has been added. After the addition, which takes approximately 1 hour, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0 and 50 g. of powdered sodium carbonate is added, and the contents are shaken gently for several minutes. This treatment removes any hydrochloric acid which may have been produced during the reaction. The mixture is then filtered directly into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask containing 135 g. (0.951 mole) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. A condenser is fitted to the flask and the solution is heated at gentle reflux for 3 hours (Note 1). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (Note 2). The crude Diels-Alder adduct, which will slowly solidify on standing, is used directly in the next step.\nThe crude Diels-Alder adduct is transferred to a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached to a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask; the latter is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 200\u00b0 and equipped with a distillation head, condenser, and receiving flask. The pressure inside the equipment is reduced to 20 mm. A magnetic stirrer in the pyrolysis flask is started, the Diels-Alder adduct (Note 3) is added slowly to the hot flask, and the pyrolysate collected in the receiving flask. The distillation temperature during the pyrolysis varies from 135\u00b0 to 152\u00b0, depending on the rate of addition of the Diels-Alder adduct. After the addition is complete (about 1 hour), the pyrolysis is continued for a further 30 minutes or until very little material remains in the pyrolysis flask (Note 4). The crude pyrolysate is then redistilled at 12\u201315 mm., with all material boiling below 140\u00b0 collected; this distillate consists mainly of a mixture of dichlorocyclobutene and 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, the residue being mainly dimethylphthalate.\nA Final distillation at 55 mm. through a 36-in., platinum spinning band column yields 49\u201352 g. (40\u201343%) of pure cis-3,4-dichlorocyclobutene (b.p. 70\u201371\u00b0, 55 mm.); the forerun (b.p. 58\u201362\u00b0, 55 mm.) consists mainly of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene (Note 5)."

(82.0 ml., 0.500 mole) of diethyl fumarate (Note 3), and 1.0 g. of hydroquinone (Note 4). Commercial absolute ethanol (90 ml.) is added, and the mixture stirred until most of the solid is dissolved. The vessel is sealed, heated slowly to 105\u2013110\u00b0 (Note 5), and maintained at that temperature 8\u201310 hours (Note 6). The vessel is then allowed to cool to room temperature, opened (Note 7), and the yellowish, fluid reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask.\nThe liquid is stirred vigorously (Note 8), and a solution of 60.0 g. (0.566 mole) of sodium carbonate in 350 ml. of water is added to the flask as rapidly as the concomitant evolution of carbon dioxide will permit. Stirring is continued for about 15 minutes after the addition is complete. The original reaction vessel is rinsed with 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201375\u00b0) (Note 9), the rinse is added to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the product, and the mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes at a rate sufficient to achieve homogenization. The resulting loose emulsion is quickly transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and allowed to separate; the lower (aqueous) phase is drawn off into the original Erlenmeyer flask and the upper (organic) layer containing the desired product is transferred to a 500-ml. flask. In exactly the same manner the aqueous phase is extracted by vigorous stirring with two 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether, the organic layers being added to the retention flask (Note 10). The combined organic layers are transferred from the flask to the same separatory funnel and shaken once with 100 ml. of cold, 5%, aqueous sodium carbonate and twice with 50-ml. portions of cold water. The organic layer is returned to the retention flask, dried over 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered by gravity, concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Note 11), and distilled under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column, yielding 75\u201382 g.

With each portion of added amalgam there is also added 10\u201320 ml. (500 ml. total) of 50% acetic acid. The total addition time required is 4\u20135 hours. The solution is decanted from the mercury onto a Buchner funnel and filtered with suction through a layer of Celite 545. The cold filtrate is treated with 1.7 l. of cold 20% sulfuric acid; the acid begins to crystallize immediately. After standing for 4 hours at 20\u201322\u00b0, the acid is collected by suction filtration, washed well with ice-cold water, removing excess sulfuric acid, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid, giving 124 g.

For minimum losses during recrystallization, the crude acid is divided into two portions, and each is added to 1.2\u20131.5 l. of rapidly stirred, boiling water to effect as rapid a solution as possible. When almost all of the solids have dissolved ca. 1 g. of activated charcoal (Norit) is added, the solution is filtered through a fluted filter, and the filtrate is cooled in ice to induce rapid crystallization (Note 4).

The amide N-sulfonyl chloride separates as a crystalline solid, and the mixture is stirred for an hour at room temperature. The resulting mixture is cooled to 10\u201312\u00b0 (Note 2) and 154 g. (2.1 moles) of N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 3) is added over a period of 5 minutes. The cooling bath is removed and the temperature gradually rises to about 30\u00b0, then falls. After 1 hour the crystals dissolve and the reaction mixture is poured onto 200 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, dichloromethane (150 ml.) is added, the mixture is shaken, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of dichloromethane, and the organic phases are combined and washed with 100 ml. of water. The dichloromethane is removed by distillation, giving a white solid that is triturated with 250 ml. of cold water, recovered by filtration, and dried, yielding 155\u2013157 g. (95\u201396%) of 2,4-dimethoxybenzonitrile, m.p. 91\u00b0. GC using a Chromosorb W column with 10% butadiene sulfone as the stationary phase indicates that the product has a purity of 98%.

(0.075 mole) of isobutyric acid (Note 4) is added to the stirred mixture over 5 minutes. The internal temperature rises to 50\u201360\u00b0 and hydrogen evolution is completed by heating the mixture to reflux for 15 minutes. After cooling to 0\u00b0 with an externally applied ice\u2013salt bath (Note 5), 52 ml. of a standard solution of n-butyllithium in heptane (1.45 mmole/ml.; 0.075 mole) (Note 6) is added through the stopper by injection (Note 7) at a temperature below 10\u00b0. The ice bath is retained for 15 minutes before the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 30 minutes to complete the metalation. The resulting turbid solution is cooled, and 13.9 g. (0.0751 mole) of (2-bromoethyl)benzene (Note 8) is added from the dropping funnel over 20 minutes at 0\u00b0. A colorless precipitate of sodium bromide begins to separate almost immediately. The ice bath is retained for 30 minutes, after which the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 1 hour.\nAt the conclusion of the reaction period, 100 ml. of water is added at a temperature below 15\u00b0 (Note 9). The aqueous layer is separated and the reaction flask and organic layer are washed with a mixture of 50 ml. of water and 75 ml. of diethyl ether. The aqueous layers are combined, back-extracted with 50 ml. of ether, and acidified to Congo red with 6 N hydrochloric acid. The product is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether, washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated. The remaining traces of solvent may be removed in a rotary evaporator, yielding 12\u201312.8 g.

The remaining joint of the T-tube is connected to a bubbling device so that the rate of nitrogen flow can be observed throughout the course of the reaction. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 30 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 1) and 2.4 g. of about 50% sodium hydride in oil (ca. 0.05 mole) (Note 2). Stirring is begun and the contents of the flask are heated to 75\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 3) under a slight pressure of nitrogen. The flask is cooled in a water bath to 30\u00b0, before a solution of 4.45 g. (0.0250 mole) of diphenylacetylene in 20 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide is added dropwise with stirring to the dark-gray solution. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture gradually rises until it approaches 40\u00b0. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is heated to 65\u00b0 and held at this temperature for 2.5 hours. The resulting red-brown reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured into 500 ml. of an ice and water mixture with stirring. After the ice has melted, the mixture is extracted with five 150 ml. portions of diethyl ether.

            "A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser equipped with a drying tube, and addition funnel provided with a pressure-equalizer arm is dried in a 100\u00b0 oven and assembled while warm. The warm apparatus is immediately purged with dry nitrogen, introducing the nitrogen at the top of the addition funnel. The flask is charged with 81 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium azide (Note 1) and 500 ml. of freshly distilled diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Note 2). A simple distillation apparatus is then dried in the oven and assembled while warm under a slow nitrogen purge. The distillation flask is charged with 112 g. of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 3), and after a forerun of approximately 2 g. the remaining material is distilled (b.p. 57\u201358\u00b0) directly into the addition funnel of the reaction flask. During this distillation it is convenient to disconnect the nitrogen stream from the top of the addition funnel and introduce it into the distillation flask. After the distillation is complete, the distillation apparatus is disconnected and the nitrogen stream is again introduced at the top of the addition funnel. The chlorotrimethylsilane (108.6 g., 1.000 mole) (Note 4) is then added rapidly to the sodium azide slurry, and this mixture is stirred at 70\u00b0 for 60 hours. During this period the nitrogen flow is terminated (Note 5).\nAfter the heating period is complete, the nitrogen stream is again initiated, and the mixture is cooled to 30\u00b0. The addition funnel and reflux condenser are replaced with two gas-inlet tubes with stopcocks. One inlet tube is connected to the nitrogen source and the other to a standard vacuum trap, of at least 150 ml. capacity. A vacuum (15\u201320 mm.) is applied to the trap after the latter is cooled to \u221278\u00b0, and the product is then distilled at 30\u00b0 (15 mm.) into the trap. Slight heating is necessary to maintain 30\u00b0, and rapid stirring should be continued throughout. Removal of volatile product is complete within 5 hours under these conditions. The entire system is then slowly pressurized to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen, and the product is redistilled through a 5-cm. Vigreux column. From 121 g. of crude flash distillate are obtained 4.0 g. of forerun and 98 g. (85%) of pure trimethylsilyl azide, b.p. 95\u201399\u00b0. During the distillation the pot temperature is maintained at 135\u2013140\u00b0 with a thermostated oil bath. The pot residue contains 19 g. of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether with traces of trimethylsilyl azide. The purity of the product cut as established by 1H NMR (CCl4) is 98%. A single peak at 13 cps. downfield from tetramethylsilane is observed, the only impurity being siloxane hydrolysis products. Chlorotrimethylsilane is conspicuous by its absence."
