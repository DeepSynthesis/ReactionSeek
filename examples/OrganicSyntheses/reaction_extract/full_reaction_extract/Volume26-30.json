            "Six hundred and seventy-five grams (6 moles) of 80% lactic acid (Note 1), 300 ml. of benzene, and 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid are placed in a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask having a capillary ebullition tube in one neck. The flask is attached to a Vigreux column 75 cm. in length, having at its top a trap of the Dean and Stark type, preferably the Barrett modification carrying a stopcock (Note 2), and a reflux condenser. The mixture is refluxed, and the aqueous layer is withdrawn from the trap until liberation of water becomes slow or until noticeable darkening of the material begins (Note 3). Then 1394 g. (1635 ml. or 24 moles) of allyl alcohol is added (Note 4), and refluxing and removal of water are continued until production of water ceases (Note 5). The acid catalyst is then neutralized with anhydrous sodium acetate (18 g.) (Note 6), and the fractionating column is replaced by a short distillation head leading to a 3-l. round-bottomed receiving flask cooled in salt and ice. The liquid is distilled rapidly under diminished pressure, first at the water pump and finally at a pressure of about 5 mm. A viscous residue (about 130 g.) containing inorganic salts is discarded. The distillate is fractionated through the column used in the first steps. The trap at the reflux condenser is replaced with a still head arranged for controlled partial take-off. The first fraction is the benzene-allyl alcohol binary azeotrope, which distils at 76.8\u00b0 and contains 17.4% of the alcohol. Frequently a small amount of allyl ether is obtained at 94\u201395\u00b0. Allyl alcohol is then distilled at 97\u00b0 until most of it is removed and the temperature of the residue in the pot reaches about 120\u00b0. The pressure is reduced to about 50 mm. while the remainder of the alcohol is removed. Finally the allyl lactate is distilled at 56\u201360\u00b0/8 mm. (Note 7). It amounts to 693\u2013710 g. (89\u201391%) (Note 8)."

(11.3 moles) of purified zinc dust (Note 1) are thoroughly ground together in a mortar, and then enough water (about 400 ml.) is added with stirring with the pestle to form a thick paste. The paste is transferred to a 3-l. enameled can or beaker surrounded by an ice bath. A solution of 128 g. (2.14 moles) of glacial acetic acid in 130 ml. of water is cooled to 5\u00b0 in another 3-l. beaker, which is fitted with a strong mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The paste of nitroguanidine and zinc dust, cooled to 5\u00b0, is added slowly with mechanical stirring, the temperature of the reaction mixture being kept between 5\u00b0 and 15\u00b0. A total of about 1 kg. of cracked ice is added to the mixture from time to time as the mixture becomes too warm or too thick to stir. The addition of the paste takes about 8 hours, and the final volume of the mixture is about 1.5 l. (Note 2). The mixture is then slowly warmed to 40\u00b0 on a water bath with continued stirring, and this temperature is maintained for 1\u20135 minutes, until reduction is complete (Note 3).\nThe solution is immediately separated from the insoluble material by filtration on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the cake is sucked as dry as possible. The residue is transferred to the 3-l. beaker, triturated well with 1 l. of water, and then separated from the liquid by filtration. In the same manner, the residue is washed twice more with two 600-ml. portions of water. The filtrates are combined and placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. Two hundred grams of ammonium chloride is added, and the solution is mechanically stirred until solution is complete (Note 4). The stirring is continued, and 220 g. (2.62 moles) of sodium bicarbonate is added during a period of about 10 minutes. The aminoguanidine bicarbonate begins to precipitate after a few minutes, and the solution is then placed in a refrigerator overnight. The precipitate is collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The cake is removed to a 1-l. beaker and mixed with a 400-ml. portion of a 5% solution of ammonium chloride and filtered. It is again washed with two 400-ml. portions of distilled water, the wash solution being removed each time by filtration. Finally the solid is pressed down on the B\u00fcchner funnel; the mat is broken up with a spatula and washed while on the funnel with two 400-ml. portions of 95% ethanol and then with one 400-ml. portion of ether. After air drying, the aminoguanidine bicarbonate amounts to 180\u2013182 g. (63\u201364%) of a white solid, melting at 172\u00b0 with decomposition (Note 5) and (Note 6)."

            "Warning: Diazomethane is poisonous and explosive.\nTwelve grams (0.18 mole) of ground potassium hydroxide is dissolved in 45 ml. of n-propyl alcohol in a three-necked 500-ml. flask set on a steam bath so that the mixture can be warmed. Two necks of the flask are fitted with dropping funnels. A Vigreux fractionating column (25 cm. in length and 12 mm. in diameter) is inserted in the third neck of the flask. The column is connected, through a condenser and adapter, to a filter flask set in ice as the receiver. The side arm of the receiver is fitted with a drying tube. About 1.5 hours is required to dissolve the hydroxide, whereupon an additional amount of alcohol is added to bring the total volume to 50 ml. The solution is then cooled, and 100 ml. of absolute ether is added. Through one dropping funnel is added dropwise 20 ml. of nitrosomethylurethan1 (equivalent to 0.10 mole of diazomethane; (Note 1)). The flask is warmed on a steam bath so that diazomethane distils over with ether while the nitrosomethylurethan is being added. The addition requires about 20 minutes. During this operation more dry ether is added as needed, through the second dropping funnel, until the total volume of ether distillate is 250 ml. When the ether distilling over is colorless, the distillate is transferred to another three-necked 500-ml. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser. To the stirred solution is added, over a period of 15 minutes, a solution of 6.6 ml. (7.7 g., 0.050 mole) of phenylacetyl chloride in 10 ml. of absolute ether. A copious evolution of nitrogen accompanies this operation.\nAfter standing for 2 hours, the solution of diazoketone is cooled in ice and treated with dry gaseous hydrogen chloride until the passage of the gas no longer causes evolution of nitrogen (Note 2). At the end of this time, the original yellow color of the solution has changed to an orange-red. About 100 ml. of water is slowly and cautiously added to the ether solution in order to cause a separation into two layers. An additional 50 ml. of water is then added to give a more complete separation. The ether layer is then washed with two 50-ml. portions of a 5% solution of sodium carbonate in water. The ether solution is dried with anhydrous calcium chloride or calcium sulfate, the solvent evaporated, and the product distilled. The yield of benzyl chloromethyl ketone, b.p. 133\u2013135\u00b0/19 mm. or 96\u201398\u00b0/1 mm., is 7.0\u20137.1 g. (83\u201385%) (Note 3) and (Note 4)."

            "A 3-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. The flask is contained in a pneumatic trough through which water at room temperature is circulated. A mixture of 30 ml. of ethyl cyanoacetate and 100 ml. of ethanol is placed in the flask. Meanwhile 54 g. (0.5 mole) of p-benzoquinone in a 1-l. flask is heated to 40\u00b0 with 500 ml. of 95% ethanol, and, when practically all the quinone is dissolved, 56 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate is added and the mixture is stirred until solution is complete (Note 1). Most of this solution is placed in the 500-ml. dropping funnel, the remainder being added when the funnel becomes sufficiently emptied after the reaction has started.\nTwenty-five milliliters of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (Note 2) is introduced into the 3-l. flask. A solution of 100 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is placed in the 250-ml. dropping funnel, which is loosely stoppered. Stirring is started, and the stopcocks of the two dropping funnels are adjusted so that the solutions will be delivered into the flask at a uniform rate in a period of about 45 minutes (Note 3). Stirring is continued for an additional 10 minutes. The mixture is then permitted to stand for 1 hour, after which the purplish red precipitate is filtered with suction. Any solid material adhering to the walls of the flask is washed onto the funnel with ethanol. The solid is then washed three times on the funnel with ethanol (Note 4). The filtrate and washings are discarded. The product is slightly impure diethyl \u03b1,\u03b1'-dicyano-2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzenediacetate and weighs 36\u201341 g. (43\u201349%) (Note 5).\nFor the hydrolysis, 36 g. (0.11 mole) of the residue is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, and 210 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 190 ml. of water is added. The mixture is refluxed gently at first, then vigorously (Note 6), until hydrolysis is essentially complete (about 20 hours). Then 180 ml. of water and 4 g. of Norit A are added and the mixture is stirred and boiled for 3 minutes, after which it is rapidly filtered with suction through two layers of hardened filter paper in a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 7). The filtrate, upon cooling to 20\u00b0 or below, deposits 18 g. (72%) of lightly colored 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzenediacetic acid (Note 8). A snow-white product is obtained by dissolving 18 g. of this material in 375 ml. of boiling water, treating with 2 g. of Norit A, and filtering. Upon cooling, there is deposited 15 g. (61%) of the acid which melts at 233\u00b0 (Note 9)."

A solution of 23.8 ml. (0.41 mole) of absolute ethanol (Note 2) in 50 ml. of absolute ether is added through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for 10\u201311 hours. The reflux condenser is replaced by a mercury-seal stirrer. A thermometer and a calcium chloride tube are fitted into the third neck of the flask. The suspension of sodium ethoxide in absolute ether is cooled to \u221210\u00b0 to \u221215\u00b0 in an ice-hydrochloric acid bath, and a solution of 47.85 g. (0.19 mole) of ethyl \u03b3-veratrylbutyrate (Note 3) and 29.6 g.

The mixture is kept at \u221210\u00b0 for 4 hours, and then the thermometer and calcium chloride tube are removed and the stirrer is replaced by a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride tube. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and stand for 72 hours. During this time a gas is evolved and a pale yellow solid separates.\nOn digestion of this solid mass with 1 l. of ice and water, the sodium salt of the enol dissolves in the water, and the unreacted ester is removed by extracting the aqueous layer with two 200-ml. portions of ether (Note 5). The formyl derivative settles out as an oil upon acidification of the aqueous layer with dilute sulfuric acid. The oil is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether, and the ethereal extract is washed several times with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is distilled, and, to remove traces of ethyl formate, the oil is heated on a steam bath under a pressure of 20\u201330 mm. for 1 hour.

Much frothing occurs during the addition of the acid, and care must be exercised to avoid loss of material due to foaming over the sides of the beaker. After the reaction has subsided, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand from 4 to 6 hours to ensure complete removal of calcium carbonate. The residue is then filtered, washed with water until neutral to litmus, and dried in an oven at 50\u201360\u00b0. The weight of dried chitin is usually about 70 g., but with some lots of crab shells it may be as low as 40 g.\nTo 40 g. of dry chitin in a 500-ml. beaker is added 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (C.P., sp. gr. 1.18), and the mixture is heated on a boiling water bath for 2.5 hours with continuous mechanical agitation. At the end of this time solution is complete, and 200 ml. of water and 4 g. of Norit are added. The beaker is transferred to a hot plate, and the solution is maintained at a temperature of about 60\u00b0 and is stirred continuously during the process of decolorization. After an hour the solution is filtered through a layer of a filter aid such as Filter-Cel. The filtrate is usually a pale straw color; however, if an excessive color persists, the decolorization may be repeated until the solution becomes almost colorless. The filtrate is concentrated under diminished pressure at 50\u00b0 until the volume of the solution is 10\u201315 ml. The white crystals of glucosamine hydrochloride are washed onto a sintered-glass filter with 95% ethanol. The white crystalline product, after being washed with 95% ethanol and dried, weighs 24\u201328 g. (60\u201370% of the weight of the chitin used). The optical rotation of a stable solution of the product containing the \u03b1- and \u03b2-isomers at equilibrium, [\u03b1]25.5D, varies from +68.8\u00b0 to +70.1\u00b0 (c = 4.75 in water).\nThe product is pure enough for most uses. If a purer product is desired, the crystals may be dissolved in the minimum amount of boiling water and treated with Norit. The resulting solution is filtered and added to a large excess of 95% ethanol and stirred vigorously for several hours. The product is collected after 4\u20136 hours. An appreciable amount of the \u03b2-form of the amino sugar remains dissolved in the alcohol and may be precipitated by adding ether."

            "Powdered potassium hydroxide (29.4 g., 0.43 mole) is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. Guaiacol (75 g., 0.60 mole) is added, and the mixture is allowed to react exothermically. After the reaction is complete, the mixture is stirred with a glass rod and then heated under reduced pressure for 3 hours at 150\u00b0 in an oil bath (Note 1).\nTo the dry salt is added 0.3 g. of copper powder (Note 2), 81 g. (0.51 mole) of bromobenzene, and a few drops of guaiacol (Note 3). The mixture is stirred thoroughly with a glass rod; the flask is fitted with an air condenser and heated in a metal bath (Note 4). A reaction becomes evident at a bath temperature of 160\u2013180\u00b0, liquefaction occurs, and the color of the mixture changes to red or purple. The temperature is gradually raised to 200\u00b0 and maintained at 200\u00b0 for 2 hours.\nAfter cooling, the products are extracted from the reaction mixture with successive portions of water and ether. Extraction is facilitated by breaking up the solid material with a glass rod. The total amounts. of solvents required are approximately 750 ml. of water and 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether and water solutions are transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and steam-distilled with superheated steam maintained at 180\u2013200\u00b0. After removal of the ether, 300 ml. of distillate is collected. This distillate contains the unreacted starting materials. Continued distillation gives 64\u201369 g. (62\u201367%) of crude solid 2-methoxydiphenyl ether in 14 l. of distillate. The product is filtered with suction and dried. Crystallization from a mixture of 600 ml. of low-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) and 435 ml. of higher-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) yields 54\u201361 g. of 2-methoxydiphenyl ether melting at 77\u201378\u00b0. Other 2-methoxydiphenyl ethers have been prepared by this procedure (Note 5)."

(0.5 mole) of potassium hydroxide (Note 1) in 1.5 l. of distilled water in a 5-l. flask or other appropriate container fitted with a mechanical stirrer is added 80 g. (0.5 mole) of methyl hydrogen adipate (Note 2). With continuous stirring a solution of 85 g. (0.5 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of distilled water is added rapidly (about 15 minutes). The precipitated methyl silver adipate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with methanol, and dried in an oven at 50\u201360\u00b0. For the next step the dried silver salt is finely powdered and sieved through a 40-mesh screen. The combined yield from two such runs is 213 g. (80%).\nThe 213 g. (0.8 mole) of finely powdered silver salt is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask (Note 3); two necks of the flask are stoppered, and the third is connected to a water pump through a U-tube or flask containing Drierite. The flask is then placed in an oil bath and evacuated to a pressure of about 15 mm. The temperature of the oil bath is maintained at 100\u2013110\u00b0 for 36 hours (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nThe pressure in the flask is restored to that of the atmosphere. The flask is removed from the oil bath and equipped with a dropping funnel, condenser, and mechanical stirrer (Note 6). To the salt is added 350 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride (Note 7); the stirrer is started, and 117 g. (40 ml., 0.73 mole) of dry bromine (p. 790, Note 2) is added through the dropping funnel over a 30- to 40-minute period. Occasional cooling may be necessary as the reaction is quite vigorous at first. When all the bromine has been added, the mixture is heated for 1 hour on a steam bath. It is then filtered and the silver bromide washed thoroughly on the filter with 100 ml. of warm carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate is washed once with 100 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution and dried over 30\u201340 g. of Drierite. The solvent is removed and the residue distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 75\u201380\u00b0/4 mm. is 101\u2013106 g. The yield is 65\u201368% based on the weight of the methyl silver adipate before drying under reduced pressure, or 52\u201354% based upon methyl hydrogen adipate."

(1.06 moles) of 95% sodium cyanide in 128 ml. of water. The solution is refluxed on a steam bath for 5 hours, during which time some ammonia is evolved and the solution becomes dark yellow. A suspension of 150 g. of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 286 ml. of hot water is added to the solution, and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (about 30 mm.) to a volume of about 400 ml. It is again refluxed on the steam bath for 4 hours or until the evolution of ammonia almost ceases (Note 2). The solution is then concentrated to a thick paste under reduced pressure.\nThe residue is cooled and dissolved in 171 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) (Note 3), and the solution is warmed for 30 minutes on the steam bath. It is immediately concentrated to complete dryness under reduced pressure (Note 4). The flask is cooled, 300 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is refluxed for a short time to render the cake friable. The benzene is removed by decantation, and the cake is pulverized and extracted six times by refluxing it briefly with 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined benzene and ether extracts are filtered and concentrated to a volume of about 225 ml. In the mean-time the residual salts are extracted twice by refluxing them vigorously for a short time with 300-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene solutions are separated by decantation and added to the ether concentrate. The distillation is then continued until about two-thirds of the benzene has been removed, when the benzene solution is poured into a beaker and allowed to cool. The methylsuccinic acid is collected on a filter and is washed by shaking a suspension of it in 150 ml. of chloroform (Note 5). The yield of air-dried product, melting at 110\u2013111\u00b0, amounts to 87\u201393 g. (66\u201370%) (Note 6)."

(6.85 moles) of adipic acid and 2 kg. (1220 ml., 16.8 moles) of thionyl chloride (Note 2) and (Note 3). The mixture is stirred and heated gently on the steam bath until solution is effected, and the evolution of hydrogen chloride (Note 4) ceases after about 3 hours. The excess thionyl chloride is distilled by heating on a steam bath, the last portion of the reagent being taken off under reduced pressure.\nTo the acid chloride, mechanically stirred and heated on the steam bath, is added 2.5 kg. (805 ml., 15.6 moles) of dry bromine (p. 124) as rapidly as it will react (Note 5). The addition requires about 12 hours. The contents of the flask are stirred and heated an additional 2 hours, transferred to a dropping funnel (Note 6), and added in a thin stream to 5 l. of absolute ethanol, which has previously been placed in a 12-l. flask provided with a stopper carrying an efficient reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer. The resulting vigorous reaction is controlled by external cooling. After the dibromoacid chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and is then poured into 5 l. of cold water. The top ethanolic aqueous layer is decanted and extracted once with 8 l. of ether. The oily bottom layer is dissolved in the ether extract and washed first with 1 l. of a 2% sodium bisulfite solution, then with two 1-l. portions of 3% sodium carbonate solution, and finally with several portions of water. The ether solution is dried over 175 g. of potassium carbonate; the solvent is distilled on the steam bath. The yield of residual ester (Note 7) amounts to 2260\u20132400 g. (91\u201397%).",
            "B. Muconic acid. To a solution of 3 kg. of potassium hydroxide and 5 l. of methanol (Note 8) in a 12-l. flask, equipped as described above, is added in a thin stream from a separatory funnel (Note 6), and with stirring, 1130 g. (3.14 moles) of diethyl \u03b1,\u03b4-dibromoadipate. The ester is heated on the steam bath to nearly 100\u00b0 before it is added. The addition is so regulated as to permit rather vigorous refluxing and requires 45 minutes. Heating on the steam bath and stirring are continued an additional 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and is cooled. The potassium muconate and potassium bromide are filtered (Note 9), washed on the funnel with two 350-ml. portions of methanol and 400 ml. of ether, transferred without further drying to an enameled 11- to 12-l. pail, and dissolved in 8 l. of hot water. The aqueous solution, to which is added 30 g. of Norit, is heated to boiling by introduction of steam, filtered through a Norit filter pad by suction, and cooled in an ice-salt bath. The muconic acid is precipitated by the addition of a large excess (1.5 l.) (sp. gr. 1.18) of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the cold solution. The acid is added in a thin stream to the well-stirred solution. After 2 hours the muconic acid is filtered, washed first with two 400-ml. portions of cold water and then with 200 ml. of methanol, and dried at 85\u00b0.

The foaming that accompanies the evolution of nitrogen is readily controlled by the occasional addition of small amounts of ether or benzene (Note 3). As the reaction proceeds, 100 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution (0.25 mole) is added in 20-ml. portions.

The residue on the funnel is washed with two 50-ml. portions of water. To the combined filtrate and washings is added concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) until the solution is acid to litmus paper. The mixture is filtered, activated charcoal is added to the filtrate, and the solution is concentrated to about 350 ml.

            "A diagrammatic sketch of the complete apparatus for the laboratory production and use of ozone in organic reactions is shown in Fig. 21.\nFig. 21.\nA. Purification train. Oxygen from a cylinder (A) fitted with a reducing valve (B) is led to a pressure release tube (C). This is a T-tube, the long arm of which dips into a test tube of mercury. The height of the mercury column should be about 2 to 3 cm. The release tube is connected through a stopcock (1) to a 40-cm. condenser jacket (D). This is filled with 4-mesh anhydrous calcium chloride held in place by plugs of glass wool at the ends. A second condenser jacket (E) is filled about halfway with 4-mesh soda lime, then a 4- to 6-in. layer of anhydrous calcium chloride, and the remainder of the tube is packed with glass wool. The ends of the condensers are closed with rubber stoppers. Part F is a flowmeter, the U-tube of which should be about 20 cm. long. The bore of the capillary should be about 0.5 mm. in diameter. The flowmeter tube is filled about half full with Hyvac pump oil. Part G is a condenser jacket (40 cm.) loosely packed with glass wool.\nAll parts up to the ozonizer may be connected with heavy rubber tubing or, preferably, Tygon tubing. If rubber tubing is used, it is desirable to place this purification train several feet from the ozonizer proper in order to prolong the life of the rubber connectors (Note 1). The sizes of parts C through G are not critical. After this part of the apparatus has been assembled, a very rapid stream of oxygen should be passed through it for 30 minutes in order to blow out all dust particles.",
            "B. Ozonizer. The conversion of oxygen to ozone is accomplished by means of three Berthelot tubes constructed of soft lime glass (Note 2) with the dimensions shown in Fig. 22. It is important that the glass be thoroughly cleaned and that the annular space through which the gases pass be as uniform as possible. Each tube has a cooling coil (Note 3) consisting of a long U-shaped piece of 6-mm. Pyrex glass tubing which fits into the innermost space of the Berthelot tube and reaches nearly to the bottom. The top of the Berthelot tube is closed by a cork with three holes, two for the cooling tubes and one for the inner electrode. The last is a stainless steel rod about 2\u20134 mm. in diameter. This electrode should extend to about 1 cm. of the bottom of the inner tube. The Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) are connected by means of mercury-cup seals as shown in Fig. 23 (Note 4). The third Berthelot tube is connected to the reaction vessels by means of either mercury-cup seals or ground-glass joints. No rubber connectors can be used for gases containing ozone.\nFig. 22.\nFig. 23.\nThe three Berthelot tubes are mounted vertically in a large battery jar about 13 in. by 9 in. by 18 in. (Note 5). They are held in place by a wooden top (see Fig. 23) which has holes and slots cut to fit the tubes. A second wooden block with holes and slots to fit the bottom of the Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) is placed in the bottom of the battery jar. It should be weighted with a few pieces of lead. Both the top and the bottom blocks should be soaked in hot molten paraffin wax. The holes in the top should be directly above those in the bottom so that the Berthelot tubes will be as nearly vertical as possible to facilitate making good connections (Note 6). However, a slight slant of the tubes does not affect the operation of the ozonizer.",
            "C. Electrical equipment. A transformer operating on 110 volts alternating current having a secondary capable of producing about 8000\u201315,000 volts and a capacity of about 400 watts or more is suitable. It is important that provision be made for varying the secondary voltage. This may be done by purchasing a transformer provided with taps on the primary windings or by inserting a variable transformer in series with the primary (Note 7). During the initial test runs for calibration it is desirable to connect an ammeter in the primary circuit in order to make certain the transformer is not overloaded.\nThe inner electrodes of the Berthelot tubes are connected to one of the secondary terminals of the transformer. This wire must be grounded (Note 8); otherwise the cooling tube inside the Berthelot tube will act as a conductor to the water line and the laboratory water line would be charged. The other wire from the secondary is connected to the electrode in the battery jar. This outer electrode consists of a grid of stainless-steel wire (No. 8 or 10 B. and S. gauge). Connecting the inner electrode to the ground results in a charge on the battery jar. Precautions must be taken so that the jar is not touched while the current is passing. Also the battery jar must be kept away from any of the plumbing so that it will not be grounded. It is best to arrange a wooden shield so that the operator cannot come in contact with any of the high-voltage connections of the secondary.",
            "D. Ozone absorption assembly. One useful combination of reaction flasks is shown in Fig. 24. It is best that the parts be connected by ground-glass joints. Tube H is the main reaction flask (Note 9), I is a condensing tube surrounded by acetone and Dry Ice to trap any volatile compounds, and J is an auxiliary analyzing tube for determining the amount of ozone not absorbed by the compound in tube H. The tubes should be assembled and clamped high enough above the desk for cooling baths to be placed around tubes H and I in order that ozonizations may be carried out at temperatures below that of the surroundings.\nFig. 24.",
            "E. Ozone destroyer. Ozone is a powerful irritant. The maximum possible working concentration has been reported to be 0.15 to 1.0 part per million of air.1 It is necessary to destroy any excess ozone and to see that the exit tube from the above absorption assembly is connected to a good hood. It is safer to incorporate an ozone destroyer in the set-up. One such destroyer consists of two tall towers (30 in.) filled with broken glass moistened with 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and connected in series (Note 10). The room in which an ozonizer is used should be well ventilated.",
            "F. Analysis for ozone. The analysis is made by passing a definite amount of oxygen through the ozonizer at a selected secondary voltage and then through a neutral 2% solution of potassium iodide. Iodine is liberated, and the resulting solution is acidified with 10% sulfuric acid (about 15 ml.) and titrated with a previously standardized 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution using soluble starch as the indicator.",
            "G. Procedure and calibration of apparatus. For satisfactory use of an ozonizer it is desirable to obtain data relating rate of flow and secondary voltage with the amount of ozone produced.\nA wet-type gas meter (Note 11) is connected to the tube J as indicated in Fig. 24. Enough 2% potassium iodide solution (about 70 ml.) is added to absorption tubes H and J to fill them to a depth of about one-third to one-half their height, and the tubes are marked at this level (Note 12). The reducing valve of the oxygen tank is opened far enough to show a pressure of 3\u20134 lb. per sq. in.; stopcocks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are turned so as to by-pass H, I, and J and direct the gases through the ozone destroyer. Stopcock 1 is opened far enough to give a flowmeter reading of about 2\u20133 mm.; the transformer is turned on and adjusted to a definite voltage (Note 13). After the apparatus has been swept out for 5 minutes, the stopcocks are turned so as to pass the ozonized oxygen successively through tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter. The ozonized oxygen is passed through the potassium iodide solution for 5 minutes (stopwatch), and notes are made of the exact flowmeter reading and the volume of gas passing through the wet meter. At the end of 5 minutes the stopcocks are turned so as to by-pass tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter; and the ozonized oxygen stream is directed through the ozone destroyer. (Caution: do not pass the ozone through the wet gas meter.) The solutions in H and J are then combined, acidified, and titrated as described in paragraph F above. Practically all the ozone is absorbed in tube H. The second tube J is to prevent any damage to the wet gas meter.\nThe procedure is then repeated, the secondary voltage being kept constant but the rate of flow of oxygen being increased so that the flowmeter readings are about 5 mm. and 10 mm. The voltage is then changed so that the general range of 7000\u201312,000 volts in steps of about 1000 volts is obtained (Note 13). Determinations of ozone produced are made for each voltage and each rate of flow. These data may be plotted on coordinate paper in order to determine the performance of the ozonizer. A portion of such data is summarized in Table I, which represents the results from two different ozonizers constructed by different workers in different laboratories.\nTABLE I VARIATION IN PERCENTAGE (BY VOLUME) OF OZONE (FROM OXYGEN) WITH RATE OF FLOW AND SECONDARY VOLTAGE\nFlowmeter Reading, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nOzonizer 1\n2.0\n5.6\n1.3%\n3.1%\n4.5%\n6.0%\n...\n...\n6.0\n10.6\n0.9\n2.1\n4.2\n5.6\n...\n...\n12.0\n15.4\n0.5\n1.7\n3.6\n4.9\n...\n...\nOzonizer 2\n2.0\n5.7\n6.7%\n7.0%\n7.1%\n7.3%\n7.2%\n7.1%\n5.0\n9.8\n6.0\n6.5\n6.7\n7.2\n6.9\n6.8\n10.0\n14.4\n5.5\n6.2\n6.5\n6.7\n6.8\n6.9\nFor practical use in ozonolysis of compounds it is convenient to recalculate these data to show the time required to produce 0.1 mole of ozone at a specified rate of flow and voltage. This is illustrated by Table II.\nTABLE II HOURS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 0.1 MOLE OZONE FROM OXYGEN\nFlowmeter, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\n2.0\n5.7\n5.97\n5.55\n5.55\n5.48\n5.48\n5.48\n5.0\n9.8\n3.60\n3.55\n3.42\n3.32\n3.33\n3.33\n10.0\n14.4\n2.90\n2.57\n2.43\n2.32\n2.29\n2.26\nAll ozonizers have individual characteristics since it is difficult if not impossible to build two absolutely identical ozonizers. Variations in the composition of the glass and the annular space in the Berthelot tubes cause considerable changes in the amount of ozone produced, as shown by Table I. Hence the performances indicated by the data in Table I would be duplicated only under very fortuitous circumstances. The production of ozone from the same ozonizer may vary from time to time; hence it is desirable to check the percentage of ozone occasionally. If the production of ozone drops markedly, the Berthelot tubes should be carefully cleaned with hot nitric acid, thoroughly rinsed, and dried. Higher percentages of ozone may be obtained by having more Berthelot tubes. With six tubes, concentrations of 9\u201311% may be obtained.",
            "H. Ozonization of organic compounds. The ozonization of each unsaturated organic compound is more or less an individual problem, but some general comments may be made. Organic ozonides are highly explosive, and hence it is safest to carry out the ozonization in a solvent which dissolves both the original compound and the ozonide. In all cases, a shatter proof screen of laminated safety glass should be placed between the operator and the tubes H, I, and J. A second screen should be placed back of the tubes to protect other pieces of the apparatus.\nThe general procedure consists in dissolving a weighed amount of the compound in a suitable solvent such as glacial acetic acid, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, or carbon tetrachloride. The solution is placed in tube H, and such an amount is used that the same hydrostatic head is obtained as when the 2% potassium iodide solution was used in both tubes H and J. Usually both tubes H and I are surrounded by cooling baths. The ozonizer is started and the gases by-passed through the destroyer for about 5 minutes while the apparatus is attaining equilibrium. The ozonized oxygen is then passed through the solution of the compound for the calculated time. Since all organic compounds do not absorb ozone rapidly enough for a quantitative absorption it is frequently necessary to run the ozonization longer. The presence of unsaturation may often be detected by testing a small portion of the reaction mixture with a dilute solution of bromine in carbon tetrachloride. The ozonization is continued until the test with the bromine solution is negative.\nIt is also possible to place a solution of the compound in tube H to the proper height and use a 2% potassium iodide solution in tube J. At the end of the calculated time the contents of tube J are titrated in order to determine the amount of ozone that failed to react with the compound. From these data the additional time necessary to complete the ozonization is calculated and the apparatus operated accordingly (Note 14) and (Note 15).\nThe procedures for the decomposition of the ozonide and separation of the reaction products will vary according to the nature of the compounds and must be designed and selected accordingly.\nSelective ozonization of compounds containing different types of unsaturated linkages is possible by choosing a proper concentration of ozone and by stopping the ozonization at the right time. It is for this reason that the calibration described above is carried out, since for certain ozonizations it is important to have the correct concentration for best results.\n1. Use of air in place of oxygen. When air is the source of oxygen the exit gases from the Berthelot tubes contain lower percentages of ozone than when pure oxygen is used. The gases also contain small amounts of nitric anhydride,2 the presence of which may cause some side reactions to occur. However, a considerable number of compounds may be satisfactorily ozonized with air as the source of oxygen. The above apparatus will operate satisfactorily with compressed air. It is essential to bubble the compressed air through three 5-l. flasks half filled with concentrated sulfuric acid before passing the air into the purification train B, C, D, E, F, G. Some data on the production of ozone from air at a secondary potential of 10,000 volts are given in Table III.\nTABLE III PRODUCTION OF OZONE FROM AIR AT SECONDARY VOLTAGE OF 10,000\nRate of Flow\n15.3 l./hr.\n21.8 l./hr.\nOzone, % by volume\n3.0\n2.9\nHours for production of 0.1 mole ozone\n4.8\n3.4\nN2O5, % by volume\n0.13\n0.08\nMoles HNO3 formed per 0.1 mole ozone\n0.009\n0.006\nAt higher secondary voltages the percentage of nitrogen pentoxide rises. A decrease in the rate of flow also increases the amount of nitrogen pentoxide. It is obvious from the data in Table III that the amounts of nitrogen pentoxide are very small and need to be considered only when examining a reaction mixture for small amounts of by-products or when the presence of this oxide of nitrogen would act as a catalyst for the oxidation of the organic compounds by oxygen or ozone."

            "Five hundred and ten grams (5 moles) of pure tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (Note 1) and 50 g. of copper chromite (Note 2) are placed in a hydrogenation bomb having a void of 1.4 l. (Note 3). The bomb, in a suitable rocker assembly, is filled with hydrogen to a pressure of 3300 to 3500 lb. per sq. in. (Note 4). The bomb is rocked and heated. The pressure must not at any time be allowed to go much above 6000 lb. per sq. in. If the pressure rises higher than 6200 lb., the heating of the bomb should be stopped (Note 5). In a typical run, the pressure reaches a maximum of about 6100 lb. at 255\u00b0 after 2 hours. The pressure then slowly falls to about 4400 lb. during another hour, as the temperature rises to a little over 300\u00b0. During the ensuing 6 hours, the pressure falls to about 3000 lb. while the temperature is held at 300\u2013310\u00b0.\nThe bomb is allowed to cool to room temperature, where the pressure should be 1000\u20131100 lb. The contents of the bomb are poured into a beaker, and the bomb is rinsed twice with 100-ml. portions of acetone. The catalyst is removed by centrifuging, and the reaction mixture is distilled through a fractionating column (Note 6). A fraction boiling in the range 60\u2013140\u00b0, containing \u03b1-methyltetrahydrofuran, water, and n-amyl alcohol, is distilled at atmospheric pressure (Note 7). Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (80\u2013110 g.) is recovered, boiling at 65\u201370\u00b0/10 mm.; the 1,5-pentanediol boiling at 118\u2013120\u00b0/6 mm. is obtained in amounts varying from 200 g. to 244 g. The yield is 40\u201347% of the theoretical, without allowance being made for the recovered tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. The residue of products boiling above the glycol amounts to 25\u201335 g."

The bottle and contents are placed in a shaking machine and shaken for 10\u201320 minutes (Note 2). The reddish brown solid is filtered through an 11-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filter cake is washed once with 400 ml. of benzene. To this filtrate there is added, immediately and with mechanical stirring, a solution of 6 g. (0.06 mole) of o-phenylenediamine (Note 3) in a mixture of 80 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 200 ml. of benzene. The solution, which becomes dark brown, is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1.5 hours; it is then divided into two portions and each portion is washed, in a 3-l. separatory funnel, three times with water, twice with 5% sodium hydroxide solution, and finally twice with water, 100-ml. portions being taken each time. Each of the benzene solutions is shaken with 50 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 5 g. of Norit and filtered through an 11-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. Each filtrate is stirred with 50\u201360 g. of activated alumina (Note 4) until a filtered sample shows a light-yellow color. The alumina is filtered on a folded filter and washed with benzene until the washings are almost colorless. The benzene is removed from the combined filtrates by distillation under reduced pressure on a water bath at 40\u201350\u00b0. The residual light-yellow solid (Note 5) is recrystallized by dissolving it in the least possible amount of hot pyridine, adding water to the point of incipient precipitation, and cooling. The light-yellow crystals are filtered on a 7-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with water, and air-dried. The yield is about 5 g. (33%) of a product that melts at 167\u2013169\u00b0 (Note 6).",

To the residue are added 200 ml. of hot water and 0.5 g. of decolorizing carbon (Note 4). The resulting solution is warmed on the steam bath for a few minutes and then filtered into a weighed 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is heated on a steam bath, and a jet of clean compressed air is directed at the surface of the solution. When the total weight of the solution is 130 g., it is cooled to 15\u201320\u00b0 and diluted slowly with 400 ml. of methanol. After the solution has stood for several hours in the refrigerator, the product is filtered with suction and washed with two 100-ml. portions of methanol. The yield of \u03b2-alanine melting at 197\u2013198\u00b0 (dec.) is 75\u201380 g. (85\u201390%)."

The acetone carboxymethoxime may be purified by distillation under reduced pressure, the fraction boiling at 95\u201397\u00b0/1 mm. (Note 4) being collected (Note 5). The yield is 300 g. (57%) of a colorless product melting at 76\u00b0.",
            "B. Carboxymethoxylamine hemihydrochloride. The crude acetone carboxymethoxime is dissolved in about twice its weight of benzene; the solution is filtered and freed of benzene by distillation under reduced pressure from a steam bath. To a solution of 200 g. (1.52 moles) of the residue in 1 l. of water, in a 5-l. flask, are added 2 mg. of hydroquinone and 1 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The flask is connected with a condenser, and steam is passed through the solution until acetone no longer comes over (30\u201340 minutes). The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 180\u2013220 ml., and 400 ml. of isopropyl alcohol is added. The solution is then stored for 12 hours in the icebox, and the crystals that separate are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold isopropyl alcohol. Further crops are obtained by concentrating the mother liquors and adding isopropyl alcohol. The crude product (120\u2013135 g.) may be recrystallized (Note 6) with very little loss by dissolving it in twice its weight of warm (50\u00b0) water (Note 7), adding 2 volumes of isopropyl alcohol, and again chilling in an icebox. Further small quantities can be recovered from the mother liquors by systematic repetition of the process described. The yield is 110\u2013120 g. (66\u201372%) of white crystals which melt with decomposition at 152\u2013153\u00b0 (Note 8) and (Note 9)."

The flasks are placed in an ice-salt bath and chilled to 0\u00b0; to each flask there is then added 45 ml. (35.2 g., 0.78 mole) of acetaldehyde. When the contents of the flasks have cooled to \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 there is added to each flask, with shaking, a solution of 2 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol. The flasks, the contents of which become cloudy in a short time because of the separation of water, are kept in the ice-salt bath for 6 hours. The reaction mixtures are then combined in a 1-l. flask and placed in an icebox. About 24 hours later, 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with shaking, and the flask is replaced in an icebox until the next day. The addition of 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is repeated once more, and the mixture is again returned to the icebox for 24 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature. At some point during this reaction period the mixture should crystallize as a mass of yellow-white needles (Note 3). This product is crude ethyl ethylidenebisacetoacetate.\nThe crude bis ester is melted on a steam cone and poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask containing 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and approximately 10 g. of small chips of porous plate (Note 4). The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. There is a copious evolution of carbon dioxide which should be directed to a gas-absorption trap since it is accompanied by acetic acid vapors. The mixture is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2 l. of ice water in a 4-l. beaker. Enough ether is added to allow separation of the layers (Note 5), and the organic layer is returned to the beaker with 1.2\u20131.3 l. of water. With the aid of good stirring the mixture is neutralized by slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until the effervescence ceases. The layers are separated, and the material so obtained may be used immediately for the preparation of 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. To obtain 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, the ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with 100 ml. of water containing 2 ml. of acetic acid, is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. After a very slight fore-run the main fraction is collected at 135\u2013155\u00b0/10 mm. This is redistilled through a moderately good column, preferably of the Widmer or Vigreux type.

(0.20 mole) of benzalphthalide2 in 400 ml. of dry benzene. After about half of this solution has been added, the magnesium complex begins to separate; it hinders the stirring somewhat. When all the phthalide solution has been admitted (about 1 hour), the reflux condenser is replaced by a still head carrying a thermometer and attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. The bulk of the solvent is then removed; this requires about 30 minutes, the temperature of the vapor remaining at 50\u00b0 for about half this time and rising to about 65\u00b0 toward the end. About 220\u2013230 ml. of distillate is obtained. The flask and contents are then immersed in an ice bath, and the magnesium complex is decomposed by the slow addition of a cold solution of 15 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 ml. of water (Note 1) with rapid stirring. The upper benzene layer is separated and transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the solvent is removed by distillation from a steam bath; this requires about 4 hours. The residual thick red syrup is transferred to a 125-ml. Claisen flask with a wide side arm set up for vacuum distillation.

(0.5 mole) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a gas inlet tube terminating about 1 cm. above the surface of the liquid, a gas outlet tube connected with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer (Note 2). The gas inlet tube is connected to a source of boron fluorides (Note 3), and an ice bath is applied to the reaction flask; when the temperature of the stirred mixture has fallen to approximately 0\u00b0 the stream of boron fluoride is started and adjusted so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 7\u00b0. The addition of boron fluoride is continued until the mixture is saturated and for 15 minutes thereafter (Note 4). The reaction mixture then is stirred at 28\u00b0 for 2.5 hours (Note 5), at the end of which period it is poured slowly into a stirred mixture of 130 g. of hydrated sodium acetate, 100 ml. of water, and 200 g. of crushed ice. The beaker containing the resulting mixture is allowed to stand in an ice bath for 2 hours with occasional stirring.\nThe mixture is poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The beaker is rinsed with 300 ml. of ether, and this portion of solvent is shaken with the mixture in the separatory funnel. The phases are separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution until carbon dioxide no longer forms. The solution is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and dried over about 25 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 12 hours, after which it is decanted into another Erlenmeyer flask and dried over about 10 g. of Drierite for 6 hours.\nA 125-ml. modified Claisen flask is arranged for distillation, but with a dropping funnel fitted in the neck intended for the ebullator tube. Portions of the dried ether solution are introduced into the flask through the funnel while the flask is heated on the steam bath for continuous removal of the solvent. After all the ether solution and the ether washings from the last drying agent have been concentrated, the dropping funnel is replaced by an ebullator tube and distillation under diminished pressure is begun cautiously. Fractions are collected at 60\u201396\u00b0/20 mm. and at 96\u201398\u00b0/20 mm. The first fraction is redistilled to give an additional quantity of material boiling at 96\u201398\u00b0/20 mm. (Note 6). The combined product weighs 52\u201358 g. (60\u201367%) (Note 7)."

(306 ml., 3.80 moles) of dry pyridine (Note 1). Three hundred grams (4.6 gram atoms) of zinc dust (Note 2), in amounts of 5\u201310 g., is added with stirring over a period of 3 hours. Heat is evolved almost immediately, and a cooling bath of water may be necessary. The reaction mixture becomes green after about 20 minutes. The temperature of the contents of the flask should be maintained between 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. After the addition of the first 300-g. portion of zinc, 300 ml. of acetic acid is added to the reaction mixture and a reflux condenser is attached to the flask. Then 120 g. (1.83 gram atoms) of zinc dust is added in small portions. Heat is evolved during the addition, and the reaction may become rather violent. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 30 minutes. A third portion of 180 g. (2.75 gram atoms) of zinc dust is added all at once, and refluxing is continued for an additional half hour. The solution is now orange-brown.\nThe flask is allowed to cool, and the contents are transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is cautiously neutralized with 2 l. of a 40% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is steam-distilled until 3 l. of distillate is collected, after which the residue is discarded. The distillate, which separates into two layers, is saturated with 1.5\u20131.8 kg. of solid potassium carbonate (Note 3). The organic layer is removed by decantation; the remaining water layer is divided into two portions, and each is extracted once with 150 ml. of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined with the organic layer.\nThe mixture is distilled using an efficient fractionating column (Note 4). There is a large fore-run of chloroform, pyridine, and water (Note 5), after which the temperature rises and 145\u2013167 g. of material, b.p. 145\u2013165\u00b0/760 mm., is collected.

(2.0 moles) of commercial 37% formaldehyde solution1 and 130 ml. of water is admitted slowly from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 10\u00b0 (about 40 minutes is required). After 10 minutes' standing, 230 ml. of dilute sulfuric acid (57 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, sp. gr. 1.84, in 173 ml. of water) is added with stirring, the same low temperature being maintained. A copious precipitate of potassium sulfate is formed. The pH of the solution is then about 1.9. A 5% potassium hydroxide solution is then added, dropwise, and with cooling, until the pH is about 3.0 (determined either by means of a pH meter or tropaeolin 00 paper); about 4 ml. of the solution is required. The flask is then removed from the cooling bath, 30 ml. of ether is added, and the mixture is well shaken. The salt is removed by filtration, using a 14-cm.

            "One hundred and thirty-seven grams (1 mole) of anthranilic acid is dissolved, with the aid of gentle warming, in a mixture of 1 l. of water and 126 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The solution is filtered into a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a gas-tight, mechanically driven Hershberg stirrer. Through one of the side necks extends an inlet tube which ends in a coarse sintered-glass gas-dispersing tip extending well into the liquid into the liquid in the flask. The inlet tube is connected with a cylinder of phosgene through an empty safety flask. In the third neck of the flask is mounted an addition tube, through the vertical arm of which a thermometer (Note 1) is mounted so that the bulb is immersed in the reaction liquid. The outlet is attached to the lateral arm of the addition tube and is connected to an empty safety flask which in turn is connected to a Drechsel bottle charged with ammonium hydroxide.\nWith the stirrer in rapid motion (Note 2) phosgene is passed into the solution of anthranilic acid at such a rate that bubbles of gas escape slowly into the ammonia scrubber (about two bubbles per second). Isatoic anhydride appears as a precipitate soon after the stream of phosgene is started. The temperature rises but is prevented from exceeding 50\u00b0 (Note 3) by regulation of the rate at which phosgene is introduced. The stream of phosgene is continued for 2\u20134 hours, or until the rate of absorption is clearly much decreased (Note 4). The flask is disconnected, and residual phosgene is blown out by passing a current of air through the mixture. The product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and is washed with three 500-ml. portions of cold water. The first crop amounts to 54\u201356 g.\nThe mother liquor is returned to the reaction flask, the apparatus reassembled, and the passage of phosgene resumed (Note 5). When the rate of absorption has noticeably decreased (1\u20131.5 hours) the precipitated isatoic anhydride is collected on a filter and washed. The second crop amounts to 34\u201354 g. A third passage of phosgene at a considerably reduced rate will often yield a small additional crop (10\u201324 g.) of isatoic anhydride (Note 6).\nThe product is dried in air and then at 100\u00b0. The total yield is 118\u2013123 g. (72\u201375%) of a white or nearly white product which decomposes at 237\u2013240\u00b0 cor.; this material is pure enough for most purposes. It may be recrystallized from 95% ethanol (about 30 ml. per gram) or from dioxane (about 10 ml. per gram). The former solvent permits the higher recovery (89\u201390%) and, except for the large volume required, is to be preferred. The mother liquor may be used for recrystallization of several successive lots of isatoic anhydride. The purified compound decomposes at 243\u00b0 cor. (Note 7)."

            "In a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, a homogeneous slurry of the following compounds is made by mixing in the order given (Note 1): 588 g. (2.45 moles) of powdered arsenic oxide (Note 2), 588 g. (3.5 moles) of 3-nitro-4-aminoanisole (Note 3), and 1.2 kg. (950 ml., 13 moles) of u.s.p. glycerol. The flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and a 500-ml. dropping funnel in which is placed 315 ml. (579 g., 5.9 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). With good mechanical stirring the sulfuric acid is dropped into the orange reaction mixture over a period of 30\u201345 minutes. During this addition, the temperature spontaneously rises to 65\u201370\u00b0.\nThe stirrer and dropping funnel are removed, and a thermometer is inserted in one neck of the flask by means of a stopper so that the bulb is well below the surface of the reaction mixture. A 10-mm. bent glass tube is attached to the second neck by a rubber stopper and attached through a trap to a water aspirator (Note 4). The third neck is closed with a stopper, and the flask and its contents are weighed. The flask, clamped in place in an oil bath which rests on a hot plate (Note 5), is evacuated, and heat is carefully applied at such a rate that the internal temperature slowly rises to 105\u00b0 (Note 6). The mixture is kept between 105\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 until the loss in weight amounts to 235\u2013285 g. (Note 7), which requires approximately 2\u20133 hours, depending on the efficiency of the aspirator. If the temperature shows any tendency to rise above 110\u00b0, the oil bath should be lowered and the mixture cooled.\nWhen the removal of the water is complete, the suction tube is removed and the stirrer and dropping funnel are replaced. The internal temperature is raised with extreme care to 118\u00b0 and is held rigidly between 117\u00b0 and 119\u00b0 during the subsequent addition of 438 g. (236 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) from the dropping funnel. The sulfuric acid must be added dropwise over a period of 2.5\u20133.5 hours, and the temperature must not vary from 117\u2013119\u00b0 (Note 8). After the addition is complete the temperature is maintained at 120\u00b0 for 4 hours (Note 9) and finally at 123\u00b0 for 3 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled below 100\u00b0, diluted with 1.5 l. of water, and allowed to cool overnight, preferably with stirring (Note 10). The diluted reaction mixture is poured with stirring into a mixture of 1.8 l. (1580 g.) of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.9) and 3.5 kg. of ice in a 12-l. enameled pail. The resultant thick slurry is filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel (24\u201330 cm.), and the filtrate is discarded. The earth-colored precipitate is washed with four 700-ml. portions of water and then transferred to a 3-l. beaker and stirred with 1 l. of methanol for 15 minutes. The slurry is filtered and this process repeated (Note 11). The crude product at this point is a light chocolate brown and weighs about 800 g. when dried. It is purified by boiling for 30 minutes with 4.5 l. of chloroform (Note 12) to which has been added 30 g. of decolorizing carbon. The carbon and other humus-like material are removed by filtration from the hot chloroform solution by means of a 24-cm. warm B\u00fcchner funnel.

The solution is then cooled to 5\u00b0, and the first crop of crystals is obtained by collection on a 24-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The crystals are transferred to a 1-l. beaker, stirred with 400 ml. of methanol for 15 minutes, and again collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 200 ml. of methanol.

The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the cold finger is filled with solid carbon dioxide in acetone. Approximately 1.7 l. of dry ether and 61 g. (2.5 gram atoms) of magnesium are placed in the flask and cooled to about 0\u00b0. Methyl chloride (130 ml., 130 g., 2.6 moles) is condensed (Note 3) in a 250- to 300-ml. test tube held in a bath of solid carbon dioxide in acetone (Note 4). About 50 ml. of methyl chloride is allowed to distil from the test tube containing the methyl chloride through the gas delivery tube into the rapidly stirred mixture of ether and magnesium. The reaction mixture is then warmed until the reaction of methyl chloride and magnesium is under way. A crystal of iodine may be added if the reaction does not start readily. The methyl chloride is then allowed to distil into the reaction mixture during a period of about 3 hours. The reaction mixture and the tube containing the methyl chloride are cooled if the refluxing of the reaction mixture becomes so vigorous that the reflux condenser does not condense the methyl chloride. After all the methyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is warmed for 1 hour so that there is a gentle reflux.\nAt the end of this time, when almost all the magnesium has reacted, the Dry Ice cold finger is replaced with a water condenser and the gas delivery tube with a dropping funnel. A solution of 142 g. (2.02 moles) of freshly distilled crotonaldehyde in 300 ml. of dry ether is added dropwise while the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and cooled. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\nThe Grignard addition compound is decomposed by adding 435 ml. of a saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 5) dropwise, with vigorous stirring, to the thoroughly cooled reaction mixture. A dense white precipitate, too heavy to be stirred mechanically, forms and settles to the bottom of the flask. After the reaction mixture has been allowed to stand for 1 hour, the ether solution is poured off and the precipitate washed by decantation with two 300-ml. portions of ether.\nThe ether is removed by distillation, and the residual 3-penten-2-ol is distilled through a short column (Note 6) at atmospheric pressure. The yield of material boiling at 119\u2013121\u00b0 is 140\u2013150 g. (81\u201386%). Pure 3-penten-2-ol boils at approximately 120\u00b0/740 mm."

            "A. Ammonium dithiocarbamate. Gaseous ammonia is passed into 250 ml. of 95% ethanol (Note 1) contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath until the gain in weight is 39 g. (2.3 moles). To this solution, still cooled by the ice bath, is added a well-cooled mixture of 76 g. (60 ml., 1 mole) of carbon disulfide and 200 ml. of ether. The flask is stoppered loosely (Note 2) and allowed to remain in the ice bath for 2\u20133 hours and then at room temperature overnight (Note 3). The mixture is again cooled in an ice bath or refrigerator, and the crystals are collected by filtration (hood), sucked dry, and washed on the filter with two 50-ml. portions of ether. Air is drawn through the crystals for 5 minutes (Note 4) to effect removal of most of the ether. The product is used promptly without further treatment; the weight of the lemon-yellow solid varies between 80 and 90 g., depending principally on the completeness of the removal of the solvent.",
            "B. Rhodanine. Just before the filtration of the ammonium dithiocarbamate, a solution of sodium chloroacetate is prepared by dissolving 71 g. (0.75 mole) of chloroacetic acid in 150 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. wide-mouthed round-bottomed flask and neutralizing the acid with 40 g. (0.38 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate (or an equivalent amount of the hydrate) while stirring the solution mechanically. This solution is cooled in an ice bath, and the ammonium dithiocarbamate from the preceding preparation is added during 5 minutes with continual stirring. As soon as the first portion of ammonium dithiocarbamate is added the solution becomes very dark in color. After all the dithiocarbamate has been added the ice bath is removed and stirring is discontinued. The solution is allowed to stand for 20\u201330 minutes longer, during which time the color changes to a clear yellow. In a 1-l. beaker 400 ml. of 6 N hydrochloric acid is heated to boiling, and the above solution (Note 5) is poured slowly with stirring into the hot acid. Heating is continued until the solution has attained a temperature of 90\u201395\u00b0, after which the solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The rhodanine separates as nearly colorless long blades which are collected by filtration, washed well with water, and dried. The product weighs 83\u201389 g. (83\u201389% based on the chloroacetic acid), and melts at 167\u2013168\u00b0. Recrystallization from boiling glacial acetic acid (2 ml. per gram) raises the melting point to 168\u2013168.5\u00b0 (Note 6); the recovery, without reworking of the mother liquor, is 87%."

            "Bromine is added dropwise with stirring to 35 g. (0.118 mole) of methyl oleate (Note 1) in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is kept below 50\u00b0 throughout the addition, which is continued until a slight excess of bromine is present; approximately the theoretical amount (18.9 g.) is decolorized. Methyl oleate (2\u20133 drops) is then added until the bromine color just disappears. n-Amyl alcohol (50 ml.) (Note 2) and potassium hydroxide pellets (40 g., 0.61 mole assuming 85% purity) are added to the flask, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours in an oil bath at 150\u00b0. Then approximately 50 ml. of the n-amyl alcohol is distilled at atmospheric pressure (Note 3). The residue on cooling solidifies into a tan-colored mass. Phenolphthalein is added as an indicator, the mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added in portions until the red color disappears but reappears on stirring of the viscous mass. This process is continued until the mixture remains colorless. Water (approximately 200 ml.) is added, and the mixture is allowed to come to room temperature. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the mixture is acid to methyl orange. The mixture is again cooled in an ice bath; the oily layer solidifies into a wax, and the acidic water solution is decanted. The wax is dissolved in 100 ml. of 95% ethanol at room temperature, and water is added until the solution becomes turbid. The mixture is heated on a steam bath until a clear solution is formed, and then it is cooled in an ice bath and stirred while the product crystallizes. The semisolid mass is filtered, and the product is recrystallized three times from an ethanol-water mixture. After drying in a vacuum desiccator the yield is 11\u201314 g.

The flask, fitted with an air condenser 90\u2013100 cm. in length (Note 1), is arranged for heating by a water bath. A tube leads from the condenser to a gas trap.\nThe temperature of the water bath is raised cautiously to 45\u201350\u00b0, at which point the reaction begins (Note 2). Heating is continued until visible reaction has almost completely stopped. During this time (Note 3), the temperature has been raised gradually to 65\u00b0. The flask is then cooled by flooding the bath with ice water, and a second portion, 162 g. (30% of the total), of iodine is added. The flask is heated again at 65\u00b0 until the reaction ceases. After cooling as before, the last portion, 54 g. (10% of the total), of iodine is added.\nWhen reaction at 65\u00b0 has ceased and the flask has been cooled, the condenser is removed, and the flask is arranged for heating on an oil bath in a well-ventilated area (Note 4). The temperature of the bath is raised to 175\u00b0 and maintained at 170\u2013180\u00b0 until the evolution of sulfur trioxide and iodine fumes has slowed considerably (about 2 hours at 170\u00b0). The flask is allowed to cool to about 60\u00b0 before the contents are poured into a beaker, which is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.\nThe solid is filtered by suction on a glass filter cloth and is washed with two 100-ml. portions of concentrated sulfuric acid and then with three 200-ml. portions of water (Note 5). The light-yellow crystalline material is then transferred to a 3-l. beaker where it is stirred for 30 minutes with a solution of 20 g. of sodium bisulfite in 1.5 l. of water to remove the last traces of iodine. The heavy solid is allowed to settle to the bottom of the beaker, and the bisulfite solution is poured off. The crystals are washed with three 1-l. portions of water, each portion being decanted as before (Note 6), and then are transferred to a funnel. The product is washed with an additional 1-l. portion of water and two 200-ml. portions of acetone and dried in an oven at 60\u00b0. The product amounts to 520\u2013535 g.

The stirrer is started, and 80 g. (0.75 mole) of m-toluidine (b.p. 92\u201393\u00b0/15 mm.) is slowly added. The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0, and a cold solution of 55 g. (0.8 mole) of sodium nitrite in 125 ml. of water is slowly added, the temperature being kept below 4\u00b0.\nIn a 2-l. flask equipped with a thermometer, dropping funnel, and stirrer is placed a solution of 140 g. of potassium ethyl xanthate (Note 1) in 180 ml. of water. This mixture is warmed to 40\u201345\u00b0 and kept in that range during the slow addition of the cold diazonium solution (Note 2); about 2 hours is required (Note 3). After an additional 30 minutes at this temperature to ensure complete decomposition of the intermediate compound, the red, oily m-tolyl ethyl xanthate is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice, using 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and extracts are washed once with 100 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution (Note 4) and then with several portions of water until the washings are neutral to litmus. The ether solution is dried over 25 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, and the ether is removed by distillation. The crude residual m-tolyl ethyl xanthate is dissolved in 500 ml. of 95% ethanol, the solution brought to boiling, and the source of heat removed. To this hot solution is added slowly 175 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets so that the solution keeps boiling, and the mixture is refluxed until a sample is completely soluble in water (about 8 hours). Approximately 400 ml. of ethanol is then removed by distillation on a steam bath, and the residue is taken up in the minimum of water (about 500 ml.). The aqueous solution is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, the extract being discarded. The aqueous solution is now made strongly acid to Congo red paper, using 6 N sulfuric acid (Note 5) (625\u2013650 ml.). The acidified solution is placed in a 3-l. flask, 2 g. of zinc dust is added, and the m-thiocresol is distilled with steam. The lower layer of the m-thiocresol is separated; the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, the extracts being added to the oil. After drying with 50 g. of Drierite, the ether is removed by distillation, and the oily residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of colorless m-thiocresol, b.p. 90\u201393\u00b0/25 mm., is 59\u201369 g. (63\u201375%) (Note 6) and (Note 7).

In the flask are placed 350 ml. of dry carbon disulfide and 80 g. (0.48 mole) of fluorene (Note 2). The stirrer is started, and, after the fluorene has dissolved, 128 g. (0.96 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is added in one portion. In the dropping funnel is placed 49.4 g. (0.48 mole) of redistilled acetic anhydride, and about 1 ml. of it is added dropwise to the vigorously stirred dark red reaction mixture. If the reaction does not start immediately it is initiated by warming the reaction flask in a water bath (Note 3). After the reaction has started, the balance of the acetic anhydride is added at such a rate that the carbon disulfide refluxes gently; about 45\u201355 minutes is required. When approximately one-half of the acetic anhydride has been added an addition complex separates as a heavy mass which makes stirring very difficult. However, stirring must be maintained to prevent excessive local reaction at the point of introduction of the acetic anhydride. The mixture is stirred and refluxed on the water bath for an hour after the addition of the acetic anhydride is complete.\nThe dark green mass is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel and transferred as quickly as possible (Note 4) to a 1-l. beaker in which it is stirred mechanically for 10 minutes with 300 ml. of carbon disulfide (Note 5). The solid is again collected and washed on the filter with two 50-ml. portions of carbon disulfide (Note 6) and with one 100-ml. portion of petroleum ether (b.p. 28\u201335\u00b0). The resulting granular aluminum chloride complex is decomposed by portionwise addition to a well-stirred mixture of 800 ml. of water and 30 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 2-l. beaker under a hood. Each portion is allowed to hydrolyze before the next is added. The hydrolysis mixture should not be cooled. The crude 2-acetylfluorene is collected on a filter and washed three times with 100-ml. portions of water. After drying in an oven at 100\u00b0 for 3 hours the light-orange ketone weighs 83\u201395 g. (83\u201395%) and melts over the range 113\u2013117\u00b0 (Note 7). This crude product is transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask containing 800 ml. of 95% ethanol and 5 g. of decolorizing carbon. The mixture is refluxed for 1 hour and filtered hot. On cooling the filtrate deposits 71\u201383 g. of light-tan solid melting at 120\u2013123\u00b0. A second recrystallization from 800 ml. of ethanol yields 55\u201363 g. (55\u201363%) of a light-cream-colored powder which melts at 124\u2013126\u00b0 and which is pure enough for most purposes (Note 8)."

Both the condenser and the funnel are provided with calcium chloride drying tubes. To the flask is added 146 g. (6 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings (Note 2), and nitrogen gas, first bubbled through concentrated sulfuric acid, is passed in to displace the air. During the reaction the nitrogen atmosphere is maintained. The magnesium is covered with 200 ml. of anhydrous ether, and a few milliliters of a solution of 852 g. (6 moles) of methyl iodide in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added from the separatory funnel. The reaction starts spontaneously, and then the remainder of the methyl iodide solution is added slowly.

            "Approximately 1.5 l. of anhydrous liquid ammonia is introduced into a dry 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser which is connected through a sodalime tube to a gas-absorption trap. Freshly cut sodium (47.2 g., 2.05 gram atoms) is converted to sodium amide by addition to the liquid ammonia in the presence of a small amount of ferric nitrate, according to p. 219. A 1-l. dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube connected to a source of dry nitrogen are attached to the third neck of the flask, and, after the blue color of the solution has disappeared and a gray suspension of sodium amide remains (Note 1), 1.2 l. of dry ether is added as rapidly as the rate of vaporization of ammonia will permit. The ammonia is removed by warming the flask on a steam bath until refluxing of the ether occurs. Cyclohexanone (Note 2) (220 g., 2.24 moles) is added through the dropping funnel (Note 3), and the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux on a steam bath for 3 hours. Nitrogen is then introduced through the gas inlet tube to maintain an inert atmosphere (Note 4), and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 246 g. (2.03 moles) of allyl bromide (Note 5) in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added rapidly through the dropping funnel with stirring. If the reaction does not start soon after the completion of this addition the mixture is warmed cautiously on the steam bath. When the exothermic reaction has started it is controlled by cooling in the ice bath while refluxing continues for 20\u201330 minutes. The mixture is finally heated under reflux on the steam bath for 3 hours.\nThe mixture is cooled in an ice bath, any sodium or sodium amide which may remain in the necks of the flask is scraped into the reaction mixture with a spatula, and enough water is added to dissolve the sodium bromide. The ether layer is separated and combined with five 100-ml. ether extracts of the aqueous phase, washed with 150 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is fractionated carefully under reduced pressure through a 4-ft. heated column packed with glass helices and fitted with a total-condensation variable take-off head. The yield of 2-allylcyclohexanone boiling at 90\u201392\u00b0/17 mm. is 153\u2013174 g. (54\u201362%). In addition, 28\u201338 g. of unchanged cyclohexanone boiling at 51\u201352\u00b0/17 mm., 15\u201335 g. of diallylcyclohexanone boiling at 123\u2013124\u00b0/17 mm., and small intermediate fractions are obtained."

            "A 1-l. three-necked flask is employed as a reaction vessel from which the product can be steam-distilled immediately after completion of the reaction (Note 1). It is convenient to arrange the apparatus for the reaction and that for the steam distillation on the same steam bath, with provision for the rapid connection of the flask to the distillation assembly at the desired time. For use as a reaction vessel the flask is mounted on a steam bath and fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser; the third neck is closed by a cork.\nIn the steam-distillation assembly (Note 1) one of the small necks of the flask is fitted with a steam-inlet tube, connected through a water trap to a steam line; the other small neck is closed by a cork. The central neck is fitted to a Kjeldahl trap leading to a 50-cm. Allihn condenser set downward and connected in series to a 50-cm. Liebig condenser. The second condenser leads to a 500-ml. three-necked flask used as the receiver. The receiving flask is immersed in an ice bath and fitted with an Allihn reflux condenser.\nWhen all the apparatus has been set up and tested the flask is connected to the reaction assembly, and 175 ml. of water, 105 g. (0.38 mole) of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.5 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 6 g. (0.04 mole) of o-nitrobenzaldehyde (see p. 641) are introduced in the order given. The stirrer is then started, and the flask is heated by means of the steam bath. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 90\u00b0, 25 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added in one portion, and at 2-minute intervals three 10-ml. portions of ammonium hydroxide are added. Stirring and heating are continued throughout. The total reaction time is 8\u201310 minutes.\nImmediately after the addition of the last portion of ammonium hydroxide, the reflux condenser and stirrer are removed and the flask is connected to the steam-distillation assembly. The mixture is steam-distilled as rapidly as possible, and two 250-ml. fractions of distillate are collected during a period of 10\u201313 minutes (Note 2). The first fraction is saturated with sodium chloride, and the solution is stirred at 5\u00b0 until precipitation appears to be complete. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in the air. The product weighs 2.72\u20133.11 g. (57\u201365%) and melts at 38\u201339\u00b0. The second fraction of the distillate is saturated with sodium chloride and combined with the filtrate remaining from the first fraction. The combined solution is extracted with two 45-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is filtered, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation, finally under reduced pressure. The residue solidifies on cooling and weighs 0.6\u20131.0 g.; it can be purified by steam distillation from 40\u201350 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution until 100 ml. of distillate is collected, saturation of the distillate with sodium chloride, cooling, and filtration. The pure product so obtained weighs 0.42\u20130.87 g. The total yield (Note 3) is 3.3\u20133.6 g. (69\u201375%)."

            "A. Purification of technical phenanthrene. One and one-half kilograms of technical 90% phenanthrene is dissolved in 9 l. of ethanol in a 12-l. flask on a steam bath, and the hot solution is decanted from any insoluble material. The product crystallizes upon cooling of the solution. One kilogram of the crystallized product is dissolved in 2.2 l. of hot glacial acetic acid in a 5-l. three-necked flask provided with an efficient reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. To the boiling solution is gradually added 72 ml. of an aqueous solution containing 60 g. of chromic anhydride, and then 30 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly from the dropping funnel. The solution is refluxed for 15 minutes. The hot solution is then poured with vigorous stirring into 4.5 l. of water in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask. After cooling, the mixture is filtered, and the product is washed with water and air-dried. The product is distilled (Note 1) at 148\u2013149\u00b0/1 mm. The distillate is recrystallized from ethanol to give 800\u2013900 g. of nearly white phenanthrene, m.p. 98.7\u201399\u00b0.",
            "B. 9-Bromophenanthrene. One kilogram (5.6 moles) of pure phenanthrene (Note 2) is dissolved in 1 l. of dry carbon tetrachloride in a 5-l. three-necked flask. A 500-ml. dropping funnel, a reflux condenser (with tube to conduct evolved hydrogen bromide to the hood), and an efficient motor-driven sealed stirrer (Note 3) are attached. The mixture is heated at gentle reflux with stirring, and 900 g. (5.64 moles) of bromine is added from the dropping funnel over a period of about 3 hours. After stirring at gentle reflux for 2 additional hours, during which most of the remaining hydrogen bromide is evolved, the reaction mixture is placed in a Claisen flask and the solvent is distilled at a pressure of 10\u201330 mm. The flask containing the residue is then provided with a fine capillary inlet tube, a thermometer, and a 2-l. distilling flask as receiver. The impure 9-bromophenanthrene is distilled (Note 4), and the material boiling at 177\u2013190\u00b0/2 mm. is collected. The yield is 1300\u20131360 g.

(0.87 mole) (Note 1) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is finely powdered in a mortar and introduced into a dry 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an air condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a gas-absorption trap. The flask is placed in an oil bath (Note 2) which is heated slowly from room temperature so that at the end of about 30 minutes the temperature of the oil reaches 110\u2013120\u00b0, at which point the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins. The temperature is then raised slowly to 160\u2013165\u00b0 and maintained at that point for about 3 hours (Note 3); at the end of about 2 hours the evolution of hydrogen chloride becomes very slow and the mass assumes a green color and becomes pasty in consistency (Note 4).\nThe flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The excess aluminum chloride is decomposed by treating the reaction mixture with 350 g. of crushed ice followed by 25 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solid obtained is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water. The crude product weighs about 35 g. (89\u201390%).

            "Approximately 300 ml. of commercial anhydrous liquid ammonia is added to a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser connected to a soda-lime drying tube (Note 1). The drying tube is attached to a gas-absorption trap, or the apparatus is assembled in a well-ventilated hood. The third neck of the flask is closed with a stopper. Freshly cut sodium (13.8 g., 0.6 gram atom) is weighed under xylene or kerosene, and a small amount is added to the liquid ammonia, with stirring, until a permanent blue color is produced. A few small crystals of ferric nitrate are added to catalyze the conversion of sodium to sodium amide (Note 2), and when the blue color has disappeared the remainder of the sodium is added in small pieces. When the sodium is converted completely to sodium amide, as indicated by change of the blue solution to a gray suspension, the ammonia is evaporated by warming the flask on a steam bath. During this operation sufficient dry ether is added through a dropping funnel (attached to the third neck of the flask) so that the volume of the liquid remains approximately 300 ml. After practically all the ammonia has been evaporated, as indicated by refluxing of the ether, the sodium amide suspension is stirred and heated under reflux for a few minutes and then cooled to room temperature. The procedure to this point requires approximately 1 hour.\nA solution of 30 g. (0.3 mole) of redistilled methyl isobutyl ketone in 50 ml. of absolute ether is added to the stirred suspension of sodium amide during 5\u201310 minutes. After an additional 5 minutes, a solution of 78 g. (0.6 mole) of redistilled ethyl isovalerate in 50 ml. of dry ether is added during about 15 minutes. Stirring is continued for 2 hours while the mixture is heated under reflux on the steam bath. The gelatinous suspension of the sodium salt of diisovalerylmethane is poured into 300 ml. of water, made neutral to litmus by dilute hydrochloric acid, and extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue is dissolved in an equal volume of methanol. A solution prepared from 44 g. of cupric acetate monohydrate and 350 ml. of water is heated nearly to the boiling point, filtered, and added to the methanol solution. The resulting mixture is allowed to stand until it has cooled to room temperature. The blue copper salt of diisovalerylmethane is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed as dry as possible, washed on the funnel with 100 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0), and again sucked dry. The yield of the copper salt after air drying is 44\u201351 g. (69\u201379%); it melts in the range 150\u2013155\u00b0 (Note 3).\nThe diisovalerylmethane is regenerated by shaking the copper salt vigorously with 500 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid and 200 ml. of ether until all the salt has dissolved. The aqueous acid layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of diisovalerylmethane is 32\u201342 g. (58\u201376%, based on methyl isobutyl ketone), b.p. 115\u2013116\u00b0/20 mm., nD25 1.4565 (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

(540 g., 9.0 moles) of 28% ammonia containing 12 g. of cuprous chloride. The steel reaction vessel is heated and rocked at 195\u00b0 (thermostatic control) (Note 2) for 14 hours (Note 3); the pressure rises to 700\u20131000 lb.

The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel (the delivery tube of which extends below the liquid surface), a mercury-sealed stirrer (Note 2), and an adapter carrying a thermometer which extends into the liquid and a condenser system such that most of the aniline will return and all the water produced (as well as excess acetone) will distil (Note 3). The flask is now heated in an oil bath (Note 4) and (Note 5), and the reaction mixture is maintained at 170\u2013175\u00b0 while acetone is passed in through the dropping funnel at such a rate that no more than 2 drops of liquid distils per second. During the addition the mixture is vigorously stirred. A total volume of 850 ml. (670 g., 11.6 moles) of acetone is added over a 4-hour period, and about 610 ml. of distillate is collected. At the end of this period the reaction mixture is cooled and distilled in vacuum, three fractions being collected (up to 136\u00b0/15 mm., 136\u2013141\u00b0/15 mm., and 141\u2013146\u00b0/15 mm.). The acetone-water distillate is now distilled through a simple column at atmospheric pressure until essentially all the acetone has come over. There remains a mixture of oil and water which is separated after being cooled. The oil is then used as the first fraction for a fractional distillation in vacuum of the reaction product, each of the previous fractions being added in succession. Three new fractions are collected: 78\u201382\u00b0/13 mm. (a little aniline); 82\u2013133\u00b0/13 mm. (a small intermediate fraction); and 133\u2013138\u00b0/13 mm. (acetone-anil).

Some crystals separate. The resulting thin slurry is dropped slowly into the cold solution of nitrosylsulfuric acid with mechanical stirring. Throughout the addition, and for 30 minutes thereafter, the temperature is kept below 20\u00b0. Seven hundred milliliters of dry ether is added slowly with stirring, and the temperature of the mixture is kept at 0\u00b0 for 1 hour. At the end of this period, the precipitation (aided by scratching) of the crystalline 4-nitronaphthalene-1-diazonium sulfate is complete (Note 1). This precipitate is collected, washed with ether and then with 95% ethanol until all the acid is removed, and finally dissolved in 100 ml. of iced water.\nA saturated aqueous solution containing 50 g. of crystalline copper sulfate is treated with a similar solution of 50 g. of crystallized sodium sulfite.

Considerable frothing occurs, and 4\u20135 ml. of ether is added from time to time to break the foam. After stirring for 1 hour (Note 3), the mixture is filtered and the crude dark brown precipitate of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene is washed several times with water, then with 2% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and again with water. The precipitate is dried and extracted three times with boiling 95% ethanol (450 ml. in all). The extract is concentrated to 75 ml.; most of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene separates and is collected. Additional amounts can be obtained by further concentration. The resulting product melts at 130\u2013132\u00b0 and weighs 6.0\u20137.0 g. (52\u201360%).

The flask is cooled, and the mixture is poured into a stirred mixture of 1 kg. of crushed ice and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 3-l. beaker.\nThe benzene layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 500 ml. of ether in two equal portions. The ether and benzene solutions are combined and washed successively with 500 ml. of water, 250 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 500 ml. of water. The organic layer is dried over 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is separated from the solution, and the solvents are removed by heating on a steam bath. The last traces of benzene are removed by vacuum distillation from a 250-ml. Claisen flask heated on a steam bath. The residue weighs about 190 g. A receiver is connected directly to the side arm (Note 8) of the Claisen flask, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure. It boils at 122\u2013125\u00b0/1\u20132 mm. and crystallizes to a yellow solid which melts at 68\u201370\u00b0. The solid is recrystallized from isopropyl alochol (1 ml. per g.); the flask containing the filtered hot solution is placed on an asbestos mat, and the solution is allowed to cool only to room temperature without shaking or stirring. The crystals are then collected and washed on the funnel with chilled isopropyl alcohol (one-fifth the volume used in the recrystallization). The product is dried in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphorus pentoxide. The yield of pure white product, melting at 74\u201375\u00b0, is 97\u2013116 g. (50\u201360% based on benzyl cyanide) (Note 9)."

(1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate in 500 ml. of 95% ethanol. The reaction flask is cooled by means of an ice bath. When the temperature of the solution has dropped to 10\u00b0, 217 g. (2 moles) of ethyl chloroformate is added dropwise with stirring at a rate sufficient to maintain the temperature between 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. After one-half of the ethyl chloroformate has been introduced, a solution of 106 g. (1 mole) of sodium carbonate in 500 ml. of water is added dropwise simultaneously with the remaining ethyl chloroformate. The addition of these two reactants is regulated so that the temperature does not rise above 20\u00b0 and so that the addition of the chloroformate is completed slightly in advance of the sodium carbonate in order to ensure a slight excess of ethyl chloroformate in the reaction mixture at all times.\nAfter all the reactants have been added, the precipitate on the upper walls of the flask is washed down with 200 ml. of water and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir for an additional 30-minute period. The precipitate is then collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed well with a total of 800 ml. of water, and dried in an oven at 80\u00b0. There is obtained 145\u2013150 g.

The temperature is maintained below 15\u00b0, and chlorine is introduced until the increase in weight amounts to 50\u201355 g. (Note 3). The flow of chlorine is stopped, and the reaction mixture is stirred until a clear, orange-colored benzene layer forms when the mixture is allowed to settle.\nThe layers are separated, and the water layer is extracted once with benzene. The benzene solutions are combined and washed twice with 100-ml. portions of water, then with 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution until neutral (usually four to six washes are required), and twice more with water, and then are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The benzene is removed under reduced pressure on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled in vacuum through a short indented column. After a small fore-run, the main fraction is collected at 107\u2013111\u00b0 /15 mm. There is obtained 80\u201382 g. (81\u201383%) of ethyl azodicarboxylate."

Pyrex tubing sealed at an upward angle to the side arm of the larger flask (A). Charred cork stoppers are used, and a hydrogen chloride trap2 is connected to the water-cooled reflux condenser. The bent side arm (C) is insulated by a wrapping of cloth. Reaction flask A is charged with 105 g. (0.89 mole) of hexamethyleneglycol,3 785 ml. (9.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 130 ml. of water (Note 1), and 55 ml. of toluene (Note 2) and (Note 3). In flask B are put 350 ml. toluene and a few boiling chips. The apparatus is assembled, and the flasks are heated in oil baths. The bath covering about two-thirds of flask A is kept at 95\u00b0; the one surrounding most of flask B is kept between 160\u00b0 and 165\u00b0 (Note 4). As the reaction proceeds and the products are removed by the continuous flow of toluene through the mixture, the organic-aqueous interface in A falls steadily. After 9 hours the heating baths and condensers are removed, and water is added to A to force the upper layer of toluene into B. The aqueous solution is siphoned out of A, and then the toluene extract in B is poured into a dropping funnel inserted through a stopper in the neck of a 500-ml. Claisen flask. Some of the extract is run into the flask, and most of the toluene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure while the remainder of the solution is slowly run into the flask. To remove the last of the solvent, the pressure is lowered to 65 mm. while the bath temperature is kept at 100\u00b0.\nFig. 14.\nThe material obtained from two such runs is combined and fractionated through a Fenske-Whitmore column4 packed with glass helices. Distillation is carried out at a pressure of 8\u201312 mm., with a reflux ratio of 5:1. After a fore-run of 5\u201315 g., about 45 g. (16%) of hexamethylene dichloride distils at 80\u201384\u00b0/9 mm., n20D 1.4585\u20131.4565. An intermediate fraction of 10\u201320 g. distils at 84\u2013100\u00b0 /9 mm., and then 108\u2013122 g.

If several runs are made the residues may be distilled from a Claisen flask and the distillate combined with the intermediate fractions for refractionation.

Stirring is continued for 30 minutes; the mixture is then filtered, and the petroleum ether and excess acetone are removed by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump). The residual liquid is distilled from a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 80\u201381\u00b0/11 mm. is collected. The yield of colorless isopropylideneglycerol (n25D 1.4339, d254 1.062) is 125\u2013129 g. (87\u201390%).\nFig. 15."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 2-l. three-necked flask (Note 1) is fitted with a reflux condenser having a take-off attachment,1 a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer (Note 2), and a 500-ml. dropping funnel (Note 1). A nitrogen inlet tube is connected to the top of the condenser, and a branch of the tube, connected by means of a T-tube, is connected to a mercury valve1 consisting of a U-tube, the bend of which is just filled with mercury. Unless the dropping funnel is equipped with a pressure-equalizing side tube,1 a second branch of the nitrogen line is arranged for connection to its mouth. In the flask is placed 24.3 g. (1.0 gram atom) of magnesium turnings, and the entire flask is warmed with a soft flame while a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through and permitted to escape by way of the dropping funnel. The flask is allowed to cool, the dropping funnel is closed, and the nitrogen flow is reduced until the gas bubbles very slowly through the mercury valve. The magnesium is covered with 150 ml. of dry ether, introduced from the dropping funnel, and a solution of 151 g. (1.0 mole) of pure isoamyl bromide (Note 3) in 350 ml. of dry ether is placed in the dropping funnel. A few milliliters of the bromide solution is added to the flask, and the stirrer is started. The flask is warmed gently if the reaction does not start spontaneously. The remainder of the bromide is added during 1\u20132 hours, and the mixture is refluxed for 15 minutes longer. The flask is then cooled in an ice bath, the dropping funnel is removed, and 98 g. (0.535 mole) of anhydrous C.P. cadmium chloride (Note 4) is added over a period of 5\u201310 minutes. After all the cadmium chloride has been added, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 5 minutes and then heated under reflux with stirring for an additional 45 minutes (Note 5).\nEther is now rapidly distilled from the reaction mixture (Note 6) by heating on a steam bath. Distillation is continued with stirring until it becomes very slow and a dark viscous residue remains. The distillate amounts to 250\u2013325 ml. At this point, 350 ml. of dry thiophene-free benzene is added to the flask and the distillation is continued until an additional 100 ml. of distillate has been collected. A second 350-ml. portion of dry benzene is added to the flask, and the mixture is refluxed with vigorous stirring for a few minutes in order to break up the cake in the flask and disperse it through the mixture. The heating bath is then removed, and 120 g. (0.8 mole) (Note 7) of \u03b2-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride (p. 169) in 150 ml. of dry benzene is added from the dropping funnel. This addition, which causes vigorous refluxing, requires 10\u201320 minutes. During this time the heavy precipitate changes in appearance and stirring becomes more difficult. After the addition of the acid chloride is complete and spontaneous refluxing has stopped, the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for an additional hour.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and decomposed in the usual way by the careful addition of about 600 g. of ice and water, followed by sufficient 20% sulfuric acid to give two clear phases (Note 2). The aqueous phase is separated in a 2-l. separatory funnel and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene. The two benzene extracts are placed in two 500-ml. separatory funnels. The original benzene layer and each extract are washed successively (Note 8) with 200 ml. of water, 200 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution, 200 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, and then each is filtered through a layer of anhydrous sodium sulfate. A little fresh solvent is used to rinse the separatory funnels and the filter.\nA fractionating column (Note 9) is connected to a 250-ml. flask carrying a dropping funnel and heated in an oil bath at 150\u2013160\u00b0. The combined benzene solutions are run into the flask from the dropping funnel so that the benzene is removed by flask distillation at atmospheric pressure. The pressure is then lowered, and after the distillation of the last of the solvent and a little 2,7-dimethyloctane (from coupling of the Grignard reagent) the vapor temperature rises to about 100\u00b0/20 mm. About 5 g. of methyl ethyl succinate (Note 10) and (Note 11) is collected at 100\u2013106\u00b0/20 mm., and after an intermediate fraction (about 3 g.) the keto ester is collected at 136\u2013137\u00b0/20 mm. (Note 11) and (Note 12). The yield of methyl 4-keto-7-methyloctanoate is 108.5\u2013111.5 g. (73\u201375%, based on \u03b2-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride) (Note 13) and (Note 14)."

            "A dry 5-l. three-necked flask is provided with a stirrer (Note 1), a nitrogen inlet tube, a 500-ml. Pyrex separatory funnel, and a large Allihn reflux condenser. To the upper end of the condenser are attached an outlet tube and a 1-l. separatory funnel. Both separatory funnels and the outlet tube are provided with calcium chloride drying tubes. To the flask is added 50.3 g. (2.07 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings (Note 2). Nitrogen gas, dried by bubbling through concentrated sulfuric acid, is passed in to displace the air in the flask. The nitrogen atmosphere is maintained until the hydrolysis of the Grignard addition product is completed. Five hundred and fourteen grams (2 moles) of crude 9-bromophenanthrene (p. 134) (Note 3) is melted and poured into the Pyrex separatory funnel (Note 4). One liter of anhydrous ether (dried over sodium wire) is placed in the upper separatory funnel. About 200 ml. of the ether and 10 ml. of the melted bromophenanthrene are allowed to run into the reaction flask. The reaction of the bromophenanthrene with magnesium is initiated by the addition of a few crystals of iodine and 1 ml. of ethyl bromide; the reaction begins after the mixture is stirred for a few minutes without external heating. As the reaction proceeds, the ether and the bromo compound are added at rates sufficient to maintain gentle refluxing. The relative rates of addition should be such that the two separatory funnels will be emptied at about the same time. After the additions are complete, but while the reaction is still in progress, the Grignard reagent begins to precipitate on the sides of the flask. One liter of dry, thiophene-free benzene is added from the Pyrex separatory funnel at such a rate as to keep the Grignard reagent in solution. When refluxing due to the exothermic reaction stops, the mixture is heated at gentle reflux with stirring for 4 hours.\nThe mixture is allowed to cool until refluxing ceases, and 296.4 g. (2 moles) of ethyl orthoformate (Note 5) is added from the lower separatory funnel over a period of about 30 minutes. The mixture is then refluxed gently for 6 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice bath, and 1 l. of cold 10% hydrochloric acid (Note 6) is added from the separatory funnel; the acid is added dropwise at first and more rapidly after the reaction subsides. The benzene-ether layer is separated from the aqueous layer and concentrated under reduced pressure in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask on a steam bath. One liter of 25% sulfuric acid is added to the residue, and the mixture. is refluxed gently for 12 hours.\nThe mixture is then cooled in an ice bath, the acid is decanted, and the residue is washed twice by decantation with water. The residue is dissolved in 1 l. of benzene in the same flask, and 1.5 l. of water and 1.2 kg. of sodium bisulfite are added. The flask is fitted with a stirrer, and the mixture is stirred vigorously overnight. The mixture is filtered through an 8-in. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the bisulfite addition product is washed on the funnel with 500 ml. of benzene.\nThe filter cake is broken up and returned to the same 5-l. flask. A saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate is added slowly (Note 7) with stirring until there is no further evidence of decomposition. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours longer. The solution is kept alkaline to litmus throughout by the addition of more sodium bicarbonate if necessary. The crude aldehyde is collected on an 8-in. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with water, and allowed to dry as completely as possible. The product is dissolved in 1 l. of chloroform, the small aqueous layer is separated (Note 8), and the solution is dried with Drierite or another suitable drying agent.\nA 250-ml. modified Claisen flask, equipped with a dropping funnel, a thermometer, a water-cooled condenser, and a receiver, is arranged for distillation. The chloroform solution is filtered into the dropping funnel, from which it is admitted to the flask slowly as the solvent is distilled (Note 9). When the solvent has been removed, the dropping funnel is replaced by a stopper and the condenser by a 250-ml. distilling flask as a receiver. The residue is distilled at 160\u2013170\u00b0/1 mm. The distillate weighs 206\u2013216 g. (50\u201352%). This material is recrystallized once from glacial acetic acid (approximately 1 g. to 0.9 ml.) and then from ethanol (about 1 g. to 3 ml.) to give 166\u2013174 g.

The bulb of the thermometer and the lower end of the gas inlet tube are sufficiently close to the bottom of the flask to be covered by the reactants (Note 1). The upper end of the condenser is attached to a small gas-washing bottle containing enough water so that the rate of passage of the exit gases may be noted. The flask is charged with 200 g. (2.12 moles) of monochloroacetic acid, 0.2 g. of hydroquinone, and 20 g. of yellow mercuric oxide (Note 2). A slow stream of acetylene is passed through a spiral trap cooled in Dry Ice-acetone mixture, a mercury safety valve, an empty wash bottle, a sulfuric acid wash bottle, a soda-lime tower, and then into the reaction flask through the gas inlet tube. The stirrer is started, and the contents of the flask are heated gently with steam until the chloroacetic acid just melts (Note 3). The temperature of the reaction mixture is lowered to 40\u201350\u00b0 after 30 minutes or as soon as the melting point of the mixture permits the lower temperature to be attained without solidification. An ice bath is used for cooling the mixture when necessary (Note 4). The stirrer is operated fast enough to throw the contents of the flask vigorously against the walls, in order to obtain the most rapid absorption. The absorption of acetylene, very rapid at first, becomes very slow after about 3 hours, and the introduction of the gas is discontinued (Note 5).\nThe contents of the flask are decanted and filtered or centrifuged to remove as much as possible of the finely divided mercury salt (Note 6). The filtrate is distilled from a Claisen flask, and 117\u2013135 g. of material boiling at 45\u201355\u00b0/20 mm. is collected (Note 7). The distillate is fractionated, and 107\u2013125 g.

        "Procedure": [
            "A 90-cm. length of 28-mm. (outside diameter) Pyrex tubing packed with pieces of Pyrex tubing (Note 1) is mounted vertically in an electric furnace (Note 2) capable of maintaining a temperature of 585\u2013595\u00b0. A 250-ml. long-stemmed separatory funnel is connected to the upper end of the tubing with a stopper (Note 3), and the lower end is connected to a 500-ml. three-necked flask immersed in ice water. The flask, which serves as a receiver, is attached to a 50-cm. water-cooled reflux condenser, which in turn is connected by short lengths of rubber tubing to two traps in series which are immersed in a Dry Icetrichloroethylene mixture. The exit tube of the second trap is vented to a hood. From 0.2 to 0.3 g. of hydroquinone is placed in the receiver, together with a few pieces of Dry Ice which serve to displace air from the entire apparatus. The third neck of the receiver is stoppered.\nThe furnace is heated to 590\u00b0 (Note 4), and after the air has been displaced 200 g. (216 ml., 2 moles) of ethyl acrylate (Note 5) is placed in the separatory funnel and admitted to the reaction tube at a rate of about 90 drops a minute (Note 3), so that the addition requires about 2 hours. At the end of the addition the contents of the receiver and the small amount of liquid in the traps are combined. The total weight of crude acrylic acid containing some ethyl acrylate is 126\u2013136 g.\nThe crude product is placed in a 250-ml. flask containing a capillary inlet tube through which carbon dioxide is admitted. Ten grams of hydroquinone and 15 g. of diphenyl ether are added, and the flask is attached to a suitable fractionating column (Note 6). The product is fractionated carefully (Note 7) at 135 mm. pressure. The pressure is lowered gradually when most of the ethyl acrylate has distilled, and at about 70\u00b0/90 mm. the receiver is changed. The first fraction (mostly ethyl acrylate) amounts to 9\u201310 g. The pressure is lowered further to 50 mm., and the acrylic acid is distilled fairly rapidly, without reflux, at 69\u201371\u00b0/50 mm. The acrylic acid fraction weighs 108\u2013116 g. and is 95\u201397% pure according to acidimetric titration. The yield is 68\u201375% based upon 100% acrylic acid content (Note 8) and (Note 9).\nIf the acrylic acid is not to be used at once, it is stabilized by the addition of hydroquinone and is stored in a refrigerator.",
            "One hundred and eighty-four grams (151 ml., 4 moles) of formic acid (Note 1), 1032 g. (1060 ml., 12 moles) of methyl acrylate (Note 2), 30 g. of hydroquinone, and 2 ml. of sulfuric acid are mixed in a 2-l. two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a capillary inlet tube. The flask is attached to a 100 by 1.7 cm. Vigreux column (Note 3) and is heated in an oil bath at 85\u201395\u00b0. The mixture is heated under total reflux until the temperature of the vapor at the still head falls to 32\u00b0 (after 1\u20133 hours). Methyl formate then is distilled slowly at 32\u201335\u00b0 as long as it is formed (8\u201310 hours). A reflux ratio of about 5 to 1 is maintained during the first part of the distillation, which is decreased to total take-off at the end. When no more methyl formate is produced, the excess methyl acrylate is distilled at 32\u201335\u00b0/140 mm. with the bath temperature at 60\u201365\u00b0. During the distillation, a slow stream of carbon dioxide is admitted through the capillary inlet. When all the methyl acrylate has been removed, the acrylic acid is distilled at 53\u201356\u00b0/25 mm. Upon redistillation through the same column (Note 4) acrylic acid of 97% purity (by acidimetric titration) is obtained in a yield of 220\u2013230 g. (74\u201378% based upon 100% acrylic acid content), b.p. 54\u201356\u00b0/25 mm."

Hydrogen is introduced until the pressure is about 1000 lb. (Note 1). The bomb is heated to about 40\u00b0, at which point the heating is discontinued and the shaker is started. The hydrogenation soon becomes rapid as the temperature rises to about 70\u00b0 (Note 2). The bomb is refilled with hydrogen as many times as necessary (Note 3). The theoretical amount of hydrogen (4.5 moles) is absorbed in about 1.5 hours.\nThe bomb is cooled, the remaining hydrogen is discharged, and the bomb is opened. The solution is transferred to a beaker, and the bomb is rinsed with a little methanol which is added to the solution. The catalyst is removed by filtration (Caution! The catalyst may be pyrophoric), and most of the filtrate is transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask set on a steam bath for distillation of the methanol; the remainder of the filtrate is introduced into the Claisen flask when the volume of the first portion has been reduced sufficiently by distillation.

(200 ml., 2.24 moles) of dry, thiophene-free benzene. Stirring is started, and, when the maleic anhydride has dissolved, 100 g. (0.75 mole) of anhydrous reagent grade aluminum chloride powder is added in 6\u20138 portions through the third neck of the flask at a rate so that the benzene refluxes moderately. The addition requires about 20 minutes. The mixture is then heated under reflux on a steam bath and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction flask is cooled thoroughly in an ice bath, a 250-ml. dropping funnel is attached to the third neck, and the mixture is hydrolyzed by adding 200 ml. of water with stirring and cooling (the first 50 ml. during 15\u201320 minutes and the balance in about 10 minutes), followed by 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 2). Stirring is continued for an additional 40 minutes, during which time it may be necessary to use a spatula to scrape adhering particles of the red-brown aluminum chloride addition compound from the walls of the flask.\nThe hydrolyzed mixture is transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, the transfer of material being completed by rinsing with about 50 ml. of warm water. The flask is heated in a water bath at 50\u201360\u00b0, and the benzene and some water are distilled at 20\u201330 mm. pressure (Note 3). While the residue is still molten, it is transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and the flask is rinsed with 50 ml. of warm water. After standing at 0\u20135\u00b0 for 1 hour, the yellow solid is collected on a suction filter and washed with a solution of 25 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 100 ml. of water and then with 100 ml. of water. The washing is done most efficiently by suspending the solid in the wash liquid, cooling to 0\u20135\u00b0 with stirring, and then filtering with suction. The preparation should not be interrupted before this point (Note 3), at which stage the crude acid may be air-dried overnight at room temperature if desired. The crude product is dissolved in a solution of 40 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 250 ml. of water by warming to 40\u201350\u00b0 (Note 4), 2 g. of Celite or other filter aid is added, and the solution is filtered with suction while warm. After the filter has been washed with two 30-ml. portions of warm water, 2 g. of Norit is added to the combined filtrates and the mixture is heated at 40\u201350\u00b0 for 10\u201315 minutes with frequent stirring, then filtered with suction. The clear, yellow filtrate is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and cooled to 5\u201310\u00b0, and 70 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added dropwise with stirring. Efficient cooling and stirring are necessary to avoid the precipitation of the acid as an oil.

Concentration of the filtrate to one-fourth to one-fifth of its original volume gives an additional 3\u20136 g., melting in the range 92\u201396\u00b0. The total yield is 49\u201352 g.

(107 ml., 1.12 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.\nWater is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3), whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175\u00b0 over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30\u201360 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter. The flask is cooled and broken to remove the product.\nThe brown solid from the above operations is ground in a mortar and placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask equipped with a downward condenser and a receiver. A cold solution of 100 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added to the solid in the flask, and heat is applied by means of an oil bath whose temperature is slowly raised to 125\u00b0 From 70 to 75 g. of distillate is collected; the head temperature ranges from about 70\u00b0 to 101\u00b0 (Note 2). The distillate is cooled in ice and saturated with technical potassium hydroxide; the organic layer that forms is separated and dried over potassium hydroxide pellets in a refrigerator for about 15 hours.\nThe organic layer is separated from the drying agent and distilled from a few fresh pellets of potassium hydroxide through a column of the Whitmore-Fenske type. After a 3- to 5-g. fore-run, the product distils at 71\u201372\u00b0; the yield is 36\u201341 g. (45\u201351%) (Note 4) and (Note 5).",

(alcohol-wet weight) of Raney nickel.2 The apparatus is filled with hydrogen, warmed to 60\u00b0, and shaken until hydrogenation is complete (Note 7). The contents of the bomb are removed and filtered to separate the catalyst, which is washed on the funnel with a little dioxane.\nThe filtrates from two such runs are combined and distilled through a Whitmore-Fenske column of 10\u201315 theoretical plates at a 5:1 reflux ratio. The yield of tert-butylamine is 55\u201360 g. (75\u201382%); the product boils at 44\u201344.5\u00b0, and its refractive index is nD20 1.3770 (Note 8).",
            "A. tert-Butylurea (Note 1). In a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a fast mechanical stirrer, a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 193 g. (105 ml., 1.98 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and 60 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered urea is added slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. Then 148 g. (188 ml., 2 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise from the funnel at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 (Note 2). After the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours) (Note 3), and then poured with stirring on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. Without removal of the precipitate, the mixture is made alkaline to Congo red indicator by adding slowly with stirring a solution of sodium hydroxide (160 g. in 750 ml. of water). The mixture is cooled with an ice bath to keep the temperature below 25\u00b0. The mixture is stirred in the ice bath until the temperature falls to about 15\u00b0 (Note 4), at which point the precipitate is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The cake is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling and quickly filtered while hot through an 8-cm. steam-heated B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 5) with the aid of suction. The filtrate is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 with occasional stirring, and the white precipitate of tert-butylurea is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and pressed as dry as possible. After the product has been spread out on absorbent paper and air-dried overnight (Note 6) there is obtained 36\u201339 g.

            "B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200\u00b0. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240\u00b0 (internal temperature 200\u00b0) and held there for 5 minutes (Note 8). The flask is removed and cooled to 60\u201370\u00b0, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0 and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40\u201343 g. and melts at 58\u201359\u00b0. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2\u20134 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43\u201346.5 g. (72\u201376%).",

(1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate. The solution is refluxed for 2 hours and cooled, and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml.) is added until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red paper, though a large excess of acid is avoided. The voluminous precipitate of phthalhydrazide is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and washed with four 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 200 ml. About 1 l. of water is added, any insoluble material is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 300\u2013350 ml. If any additional insoluble material separates it is removed by filtration, and the solvent is completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. This crude amine hydrochloride may be converted to the free amine as described below, or it may be purified by solution in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution being filtered and 500 ml. of dry ether being added to the filtrate. The crude amine hydrochloride is collected on a filter; the solvent is removed by suction, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute ethanol using 5 ml. per gram of material; absolute ether (50% of the volume of ethanol) is added, and the solution is cooled in a refrigerator for several hours. All the tert-butylamine hydrochloride is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator. It weighs 79\u201397 g.

            "W-6 Raney nickel catalyst. In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a thermometer and a stainless-steel stirrer are placed 600 ml. of distilled water and 160 g. of c.p. sodium hydroxide pellets. The solution is stirred rapidly and allowed to cool to 50\u00b0 in an ice bath equipped with an overflow siphon. Then 125 g. of Raney nickel-aluminum alloy powder is added in small portions during a period of 25\u201330 minutes. The temperature is maintained at 50 \u00b1 2\u00b0 by controlling the rate of addition of the alloy to the sodium hydroxide solution and the addition of ice to the cooling bath. When all the alloy has been added, the suspension is digested at 50 \u00b1 2\u00b0 for 50 minutes with gentle stirring. It is usually necessary to remove the ice bath and replace it with a hot-water bath to keep the temperature constant. After this period of digestion the catalyst is washed with three 1-l. portions of distilled water by decantation (Note 1).\nA glass test tube approximately 5.1 cm. in diameter and 38 cm. in length with a side arm sealed 6 cm. from the top is used as the container for washing the catalyst. The tube is closed with a rubber stopper clamped or wired in place tightly enough to withstand a gas pressure of 0.5 atm. The stopper contains three holes through which extend: (1) a tube 10 mm. in diameter reaching to the bottom of the test tube, for admitting distilled water; (2) a T-tube for equalizing gas pressures; (3) a gas-tight bushing through which the \u00bc-in. shaft of a stainless-steel stirrer projects to the bottom of the washing tube. A 5-l. aspirator bottle containing distilled water is so placed that water will flow from it through a stopcock to the. bottom of the washing tube. The side arm of the test tube is connected by pressure tubing to a 5-l. aspirator bottle that serves as an overflow from which the water may be allowed to flow through a stopcock to a drain. A source of distilled water is connected to the reservoir. Other connections and the general arrangement of the apparatus are shown in Fig. 8, and details of the construction of the gas-tight brass bushing are given in Fig. 9. Rubber pressure tubing and stoppers used in making the connections should be boiled with 5% sodium hydroxide and rinsed with water to remove sulfur. All connections should be wired in place to withstand a pressure of 0.5 atm. (7.5 lb.).\nFig. 8. Apparatus for washing catalyst. It is convenient to have the inlet tube for wash water sealed into the bottom of the chamber rather than introduced through the stopper as shown.\nFig. 9. Gas-tight brass bushing. The gas-tight bushing for the shaft of the stirrer consists of three parts: two cones (B) which fit the shaft snugly and are attached to it by set screws (E); and a bushing (C) so cut that the cones fit into it at top and bottom. The two cones are placed on shaft A of the stirrer, above and below the bushing and attached to the shaft so that they fit snugly against the bushing. A gas-tight seal is obtained by placing a drop or two of heavy lubricating oil between each cone and the bushing. The over-all dimensions of the bushing are approximately 13 by 65 mm., and it is held in a rubber stopper (D).\nThe catalyst sludge is transferred to the washing tube immediately after its third washing by decantation. The last portions are rinsed from the flask into the washing tube with distilled water, and the tube, reservoir, and overflow bottle are nearly filled with distilled water. The apparatus is assembled rapidly, and hydrogen is introduced through the inlet while most of the water in the overflow bottle is displaced through the outlet. The outlet then is closed, and hydrogen is admitted until the water in the reservoir, washing tube, and overflow bottle is under a pressure about 0.5 atm. above that of the outside atmosphere. The stirrer is operated at such a speed that the catalyst is suspended to a height of 18\u201320 cm. Distilled water from the reservoir is allowed to flow through the suspended catalyst at a rate of about 250 ml. per minute. When the reservoir is nearly empty and the overflow bottle full, the drain cock and distilled-water inlet are opened simultaneously to an equal rate of flow such that, as the overflow bottle empties, the reservoir is filled, while the pressure in the system remains constant.\nAfter about 15 l. of water has passed through the catalyst, the stirrer and the flow of water are stopped, the pressure is released, and the apparatus disassembled. The water is decanted from the settled sludge, which is then transferred to a 250-ml. centrifuge bottle with 95% ethanol. The catalyst is washed three times by stirring, not shaking, with 150-ml. portions of 95% ethanol, each addition being followed by centrifuging. In the same manner the catalyst is washed three times with absolute ethanol. One to two minutes' centrifugation at 1500\u20132000 r.p.m. is sufficient to separate the catalyst. All operations should be carried out as rapidly as possible if a catalyst of the maximum activity is desired. The catalyst should be kept in a closed bottle filled with absolute ethanol and should be stored at once in a refrigerator. The total elapsed time from the beginning of the addition of the alloy to the completion of the preparation should be not more than about 3 hours (Note 2), (Note 3), and (Note 4)."

A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer (Note 1), a dropping funnel, and a water-cooled reflux condenser provided with a short inverted U-tube on the open end; the equipment is assembled in the hood. In the flask are placed 200 ml. of dry, thiophene-free benzene (Note 2) and 37 g. (36.89 ml., 0.276 mole) of phenylacetone (Note 3). The stirrer is started, and 45 g. (14.42 ml., 0.28 mole) of reagent bromine is added dropwise during a period of 1 hour. The reaction mixture first becomes cloudy but changes to a clear orange-red solution by the time all the bromine is added. After the addition of bromine is complete, a rapid stream of dry nitrogen or carbon dioxide is passed through the solution by means of an inlet tube which now replaces the dropping funnel. The hydrogen bromide issuing from the inverted U-tube at the top of the condenser may be trapped in water in an Erlenmeyer flask or other container adjusted so that the water surface is about 1 cm. below the outlet of the tube. The reaction is complete when no more hydrogen bromide fumes can be detected in the gas issuing from the condenser. This operation requires 3\u20136 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes yellow to green. The benzene solution of \u03b1-bromo-\u03b1-phenylacetone is then transferred to a dry 500-ml. separatory funnel (Note 4).",

(0.56 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 6) and 150 ml. of dry benzene (Note 2). The stirrer is started, and the flask is heated by means of a steam bath so that the benzene boils gently. The benzene solution of \u03b1-bromo-\u03b1-phenylacetone (Part A) is added dropwise from the separatory funnel to the boiling mixture over a period of 1 hour. After the addition is complete, the almost black reaction mixture is heated to boiling for an additional hour, then cooled and poured with stirring onto 500 g. of crushed ice and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid contained in a 2-l. beaker. The deeply colored benzene solution gradually becomes orange-yellow. When the ice has melted, the benzene layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether and benzene solution is washed with 100 ml. of water and then with 100 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. After the solution has been dried for at least 1 hour over 60 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvents are evaporated on a steam bath until the solution no longer boils. The dark residue is transferred to a 250-ml. Claisen flask equipped for reduced-pressure distillation and having a receiver fused to the side arm (Note 7). The residual benzene is first distilled at 19\u201320 mm. while the flask is being heated on a steam bath. The steam bath is replaced by an oil or metal bath which is gradually heated to 190\u00b0. A small fore-run of yellow oil which darkens rapidly is collected. It is removed from the receiver by siponing and rinsing with acetone. The bath is allowed to cool to 100\u2013120\u00b0, the system is evacuated with an oil pump (Note 8), and the diphenylacetone is distilled. The bulk of the material boils at 142\u2013148\u00b0/2\u20133 mm. The distillate may solidify in the receiver (Note 9). The crude product is triturated with just sufficient petroleum ether (b.p. 35\u201360\u00b0) to moisten it, cooled in an ice-water bath, collected on a filter, and washed on the filter with small amounts of petroleum ether at 0\u20135\u00b0 until nearly colorless. The amount of petroleum ether used up to this point should not exceed 50 ml. The product is then crystallized from petroleum ether using 8 ml. of solvent per gram of crude, dry solid. The hot solution is allowed to stand at room temperature until crystallization begins, and then at 0\u20135\u00b0 for 16 hours (Note 10). The crystals are collected by filtration and dried in air at room temperature. The yield of nearly colorless product melting at 60\u201361\u00b0 (Note 11) is 31\u201333 g. (53\u201357%)."

About 5\u201315 ml. of the bromobenzene is added to initiate the reaction; when the ether begins to reflux, the balance is added at such a rate that the solvent refluxes continuously (1 hour) (Note 2). The mixture is then stirred and refluxed until most of the lithium disappears (45\u201390 min.). While stirring is continued, 97 ml.

The mixture is stirred well until the dark color of the picolyllithium is discharged, and the excess of Dry Ice is allowed to evaporate. The ether is removed by distillation under reduced pressure at room temperature. The lumpy residue of lithium salts is broken up, and to it is added 750 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol. The solution is saturated with dry hydrogen chloride while cooling in an ice bath. The esterification mixture is allowed to stand overnight, after which the solvent is removed as completely as possible by distillation under reduced pressure on a steam bath. The syrupy residue is dissolved in 750 ml. of chloroform, and a paste prepared from 225 g. of potassium carbonate and 135 ml. of water is slowly added to the solution with mechanical stirring. After the paste has been added, the solution is stirred vigorously and is kept just below the boiling point for 1 hour. The chloroform solution is decanted from the inorganic salts, and the chloroform is removed by distillation. The residue is fractionated under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm.

When this addition, which requires about an hour, is completed, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for about 20 hours to permit the evaporation of nearly all the ammonia (Note 4).\nThe solid residue is decomposed by adding approximately 400 ml. of ice and water, and the resulting mixture is carefully acidified with 50% sulfuric acid (Note 5). The organic layer is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether and washed with 50 ml. of brine. The original aqueous phase and the brine wash are then extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the ether is distilled. The product is then distilled under reduced pressure through a good column (Note 6). The yield of 1-ethynylcyclohexanol is 81\u201393 g. (65\u201375%), b.p. 74\u00b0/14 mm.; n20D 1.4822 (Note 7)."

The mixture is warmed to 65\u00b0, and 72 g. (72 ml., 0.56 mole) of technical 90% indene (Note 1) is added dropwise from the dropping funnel. The temperature must be kept at 65 \u00b1 2\u00b0, and cooling by a water bath is necessary during the addition. After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred for 2 hours at 65 \u00b1 2\u00b0 (Note 2). At the end of this period the mixture is cooled with stirring to 20\u201325\u00b0 and then further cooled in an ice-salt bath for 5 hours at 0\u00b0. The homophthalic acid which separates is collected on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction, then washed with two 75-ml. portions of ice-cold 1% sulfuric acid and once with 75 ml. of ice water (Note 3). The precipitate is then dissolved in 215 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting solution is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of benzene (Note 4), which are discarded. The aqueous solution is added to 160 ml. of 33% sulfuric acid with vigorous stirring, and the mixture is chilled in an ice-salt bath for 2\u20133 hours. The homophthalic acid is collected on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction, washed with three 25-ml. portions of ice water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The acid is transferred to a 500-ml. distilling flask, 300 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is distilled from a steam bath until about 250 ml. of distillate (benzene and water) has been collected (Note 5). The slurry of acid and benzene is filtered with the aid of suction through a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the product is spread out on a porous plate to allow the last traces of benzene to evaporate. The yield of white crystals of homophthalic acid, melting at 180\u2013181\u00b0 (Note 6), amounts to 67\u201377 g.

The stirrer is started, and 340 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added in one portion; the anthranilic acid dissolves, and its hydrochloride begins to separate almost immediately. After the mixture has been cooled to 0\u00b0, a solution of 21.6 g. (0.31 mole) of technical sodium nitrite in 210 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel, the tip of which extends below the surface of the suspension, at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 3\u00b0. The addition requires about 30 minutes; stirring is continued for 15 minutes longer, and at the end of this period a positive test with starch-iodide paper should be obtained (Note 1). The clear brown solution is then diluted with 150 ml. of ice water.\nIn a 12-l. flask, equipped with a low-temperature thermometer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, a solution of sulfurous acid is prepared by saturating 2.4 l. of water at 0\u20135\u00b0 with sulfur dioxide from a cylinder. A brisk stream of the gas is continued (Note 2) while the cold diazonium salt solution is added in about 150-ml. portions over a 30-minute period and the temperature is maintained at 5\u201310\u00b0; the reaction mixture assumes a dark orange color (Note 3). The cooling bath is removed, but sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture for an additional 30 minutes. After the mixture has been allowed to stand for 12 hours at room temperature, 3 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added; the o-hydrazinobenzoic acid hydrochloride separates at once. The mixture is chilled to 0\u20135\u00b0 and filtered through a precooled B\u00fcchner funnel; the product is washed with two 50-ml. portions of ice-cold dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid. The yield is 50\u201351 g. (86\u201388%); the salt melts at 194\u2013195\u00b0 with decomposition (Note 4) and is suitable for the next step without further purification (Note 5).",

The mixture is heated with occasional shaking in an oil bath, which is maintained at 128\u2013130\u00b0 for 1 hour and at 130\u2013140\u00b0 for 4 hours. The clear brown solution is then cooled to 70\u00b0 and poured, with hand stirring, upon 500 g. of cracked ice. This mixture is allowed to stand for 24 hours. The pale buff solid is removed, washed on the filter, first with 100 ml. of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid and then with 40 ml. of cold water, and air-dried (Note 9).

The cold diazonium solution is divided into two approximately equal portions which are placed in 500-ml. separatory funnels suspended above the beakers containing the boiling acid. The two portions of the diazonium solution are run dropwise into the strongly heated acid at such a rate that boiling continues. The solutions are boiled for 5 minutes after the additions are complete. They are then allowed to cool to room temperature and are finally stored overnight in a refrigerator. The crude product separates as a dark oil which crystallizes (Note 1) and becomes lighter in color upon standing.

(2856 g., 28 moles) of acetic anhydride and 57 g. of crushed anhydrous zinc chloride. This mixture is stirred and brought to gentle boiling. After 5\u201310 minutes at reflux, 680 ml. (714 g., 7 moles) of redistilled tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (Note 1) is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the mixture refluxes vigorously. This addition requires about 30 minutes. The mixture is then stirred and refluxed gently for 24 hours. After being cooled, about one-half of the liquid is decanted from the zinc chloride residue through a glass wool plug in a funnel into a 2-l. Claisen flask and then distilled under reduced pressure. The second portion is likewise distilled. The total weight of fore-run is 1740\u20131780 g. (Note 2). The 1,2,5-triacetoxypentane is collected at 155\u2013165\u00b0/14 mm. The yield is 1500\u20131550 g. (87\u201390%).\nFifteen hundred grams (6.1 moles) of the ester and 1.2 l. of 1% sulfuric acid (6.9 ml. of concentrated acid in 1.2 l. of solution) are added to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated strongly and agitated by tilting the ring stand back and forth until the two layers become homogeneous. This initial hydrolysis step requires 15\u201330 minutes. When homegenity is attained, the flask and condenser are set for steam distillation. The flask is heated by a Meker burner to maintain approximately constant volume, and the mixture is vigorously steam-distilled until 20 l. of distillate has been collected (Note 3). The residue is allowed to cool and then made basic to litmus paper by the addition of 10\u201320 g. of lime in small portions with vigorous agitation. The calcium sulfate is removed by suction filtration, the filtrate tested again with litmus paper to make certain that it is basic (Note 4), and the filtrate distilled under reduced pressure. This is most conveniently done by placing about one-half of the solution in a 2-l. Claisen flask, heating the flask in an oil bath at 100\u2013110\u00b0, and distilling the water under the pressure of the water pump. The remainder of the filtrate is added, the water is removed, and the distillation is continued with an oil or mercury-vapor pump. The yield of 1,2,5-trihydroxypentane collected at 167\u2013170\u00b0/0.5\u20131.0 mm. is 460\u2013520 g. (63\u201371%); n25D 1.4730 (Note 5)."

In the flask are placed 1344 g. (24 moles) of potassium hydroxide and 120 ml. of water. The contents are heated to about 140\u00b0 with stirring (Note 3).

            "A. 2-Chloroethyl benzoate. In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask attached to a 100-cm. air condenser by a ground-glass joint are placed 80.5g. (66ml., 1 mole) of redistilled ethylene chlorohydrin (b.p. 128\u2013129\u00b0) and 140.5 g. (115.5 ml., 1 mole) of benzoyl chloride. The apparatus is set up in a good hood, and the mixture is warmed gently with a low flame until the reaction starts (Note 1). The source of heat is withdrawn until the reaction moderates and is then again applied for an additional 30 minutes, during which time the temperature rises to about 200\u2013215\u00b0. The flask is fitted with a short column (about 20 cm.) and arranged for distillation. After volatile material has been removed by evacuation with a water pump at a bath temperature of 100\u2013110\u00b0 the residual liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure. The yield of 2-chloroethyl benzoate boiling at 101\u2013104\u00b0/2 mm. is 165\u2013168 g. (89\u201391%), nD19 1.5298.",
            "B. 2-Iodoethyl benzoate. A mixture of 170 g. of anhydrous sodium iodide and 1.2 l. of methyl ethyl ketone (Note 2) is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour with occasional shaking in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser. 2-Chloroethyl benzoate (162 g., 0.88 mole) is added to the mixture, and heating is maintained for an additional 22\u201324 hours with occasional shaking. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction. The inorganic salts on the filter are washed with 200 ml. of methyl ethyl ketone, and the filtrate is concentrated by distillation of about 1 l. of the solvent. The residue is poured into 1 l. of water contained in a separatory funnel, which is shaken, and the lower layer is withdrawn. The latter is washed successively with 200 ml. of 10% sodium bisulfite solution, 200 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 ml. of water. It is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (5\u20137 g.) and fractionated under reduced pressure. The yield of material boiling at 133\u2013136\u00b0/2.5 mm., nD15 1.5820, is 190\u2013196 g. (78\u201381%).",
            "C. Benzoylcholine iodide. A solution of 194 g. (0.70 mole) of 2-iodoethyl benzoate in 200 ml. of dry acetone is treated with 270 ml. of a 19.5% solution of trimethylamine in acetone (Note 3) in a 1-l. Pyrex reagent bottle which is closed with a tightly fitting rubber stopper wired in place. The solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours (Note 4), and at the end of this time the quaternary salt is separated by filtration with suction, washed with 200 ml. of dry acetone, and air-dried (Note 5). The weight of the quaternary iodide melting with decomposition at 247\u00b0 is 200\u2013210 g. (85\u201390%) (Note 6).",
            "D. Benzoylcholine chloride. Silver chloride is prepared by dissolving 160 g. (0.94 mole) of silver nitrate in 500 ml. of boiling distilled water and adding 120 ml. of analytical reagent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) from a dropping funnel in a period of 15 minutes, with continuous stirring. The silver chloride is washed by decantation with three 300-ml. portions of boiling distilled water. The moist silver chloride is suspended in 750 ml. of water warmed to 50\u201360\u00b0 in a 2-l. beaker, and 210 g. (0.63 mole) of benzoylcholine iodide is added in a period of 1 hour, with good mechanical stirring. After the addition is completed, stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes without the application of heat. The mixture is cooled and filtered with suction. The silver salts on the filter are washed with 200 ml. of hot water (Note 7), and the combined filtrates are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (water pump). The residue is dried by twice distilling to dryness with 250 ml. of absolute ethanol and then once with 250 ml. of dry acetone, the last of the acetone being removed under reduced pressure. The product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 240 ml. of isopropyl alcohol (Note 8) and allowing the solution to cool in a refrigerator. It is filtered and dried, first at 100\u00b0 and then in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel. The yield of pure product, m.p. 207\u00b0 (dec.), is 125\u2013132 g. (82\u201387%) (Note 9)."

            "A 5-l. three-necked flask is fitted with an efficient stirrer, mounted through a short glass bushing, and a long gas inlet tube which dips below the surface of the liquid ammonia. The third neck carries a device for holding sodium; this consists of a short piece of 10\u201312 mm. glass tubing, bent at a 45\u00b0 angle, through which is passed a 12-in. piece of stout, flexible iron wire (picture wire is satisfactory). The lower end of the wire is attached to a stout iron fish-hook. (Sneck Hook No. 5/0 is satisfactory.)\nThe flask is charged with about 3 l. of liquid ammonia (Note 1), the stirrer is started, and a rapid stream of acetylene gas (about 5 bubbles per second) is passed in for about 5 minutes to saturate the ammonia. The acetylene from a tank is sufficiently purified by passage through a sulfuric acid wash bottle; a safety trap also should be inserted in the line. Sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) is cut in strips (about \u00bd by \u00bd by 3 in.) so that they can be inserted through the side neck of the flask. One of these pieces of sodium is attached to the fish-hook and is gradually lowered into the liquid ammonia while a rapid stream of acetylene is passed in. The sodium should be added at such a rate that the entire solution does not turn blue. If it does, the sodium should be raised above the level of the ammonia until the color is discharged (Note 2). The rest of the sodium is added in a similar manner; the addition requires about 45 minutes, depending on the rate of passage of the acetylene.\nThe acetylene is shut off, and the gas inlet tube and iron wire are removed, but not the bent glass tubing. A potassium hydroxide tower (Note 3) is attached to the end of this tubing, and a dropping funnel (Note 4) is mounted in the other neck of the flask. n-Butyl bromide (548 g., 428 ml., 4.0 moles) is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 45\u201360 minutes (Note 5). The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours. Ammonium hydroxide (500 ml.) is then added dropwise, followed by about 1\u20131.5 l. of distilled water. When the frost on the outside of the flask is loose and can be pulled off easily, the contents of the flask are transferred to a large separatory funnel, and the lower aqueous layer is removed. The organic layer is washed with 100 ml. of distilled water, then with about 100 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid (the aqueous layer should be tested to make sure that it remains acid; if not, another washing with acid should be carried out), and finally with about 100 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution. The material is dried over potassium carbonate, a small amount of solid sodium carbonate is added, and the liquid is fractionated through a helix-packed column of about 10\u201314 plates. The yield of pure n-butylacetylene is 230\u2013252 g. (70\u201377%); b.p. 71\u201372\u00b0, n20D 1.3984\u20131.3990 (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

The flow of nitrogen is stopped, the screw clamp is closed, and the mixture is boiled under reflux until the potassium is dissolved (Note 4), hydrogen being liberated through the mercury trap. The solution is then cooled to room temperature while nitrogen is admitted to equalize the pressure. The flask is quickly disconnected just long enough for the addition of 9.11 g. (0.05 mole) of benzophenone (Note 5) and 13.05 g. (0.075 mole) of diethyl succinate (Note 5). The system is then evacuated (until the alcohol begins to boil) and filled with nitrogen. With the stopcock as shown in Fig. 5 and the screw clamp closed, the mixture is refluxed gently for 30 minutes (Note 6). It is then chilled, acidified with about 10 ml. of cold 1:1 hydrochloric acid, and distilled under reduced pressure (water aspirator) until most of the alcohol is removed. Water is added to the residue, which is extracted thoroughly with ether, and the combined extracts are washed with successive portions of 1N ammonium hydroxide until a test portion gives no precipitate on acidification. The combined alkaline solutions are washed once with a fresh portion of ether and then added slowly with stirring to an excess of cold dilute hydrochloric acid. When the addition is complete the mixture should still be acidic to Congo red. The pale tan crystalline half-ester is separated on a suction funnel, washed well with water, and dried. The yield is 14.0\u201314.5 g. (92\u201394%), m.p. 120\u2013124\u00b0. If a purer material is desired the product may be recrystallized by dissolving it in about 50 ml. of warm benzene, filtering, and adding an equal volume of petroleum ether (b.p. 40\u201360\u00b0). Upon cooling, 13.0\u201313.4 g. of almost colorless half-ester crystallizes, m.p. 123\u2013124.5\u00b0."

(1.25 moles) of reprecipitated calcium carbonate, and 150 ml. of water in a 2-l. three-necked flask is tared and cooled in an ice-salt bath. The flask is equipped with a thermometer which extends into the reaction mixture, a gas inlet tube, an outlet tube leading to a gas-absorption trap,2 and a slip- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer which will disperse chlorine gas below the surface of the liquid (Note 1).\nA rapid stream of chlorine gas is bubbled into the mixture at 0\u201315\u00b0 with vigorous stirring until an increase in weight of about 95 g. has occurred (30\u201340 minutes) (Note 2). A 250-ml. portion of water at room temperature is added to the suspension, which is then filtered by suction through rather porous filter paper on a 16-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is removed and cooled in an ice bath, and the filter cake is washed on the funnel with a 250-ml. portion of water at room temperature. The filtrate is poured back in the funnel and sucked through the filter cake repeatedly until no more solid appears to dissolve, and then is combined with the original filtrate (Note 3).\nThe cold filtrates (solutions of monochlorourea) are transferred to a 3-l. two-necked flask immersed in an ice-salt bath. The flask is equipped with a slip- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser. To the flask are added 500 g. of ice, 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and 136 g. (2.0 moles) of cyclopentene (or 1.43 times the weight increase in grams during introduction of the chlorine) (Note 4). Mechanical stirring is begun and is continued while the flask is kept packed in ice until the cyclopentene (the top layer) disappears and a heavy oil settles to the bottom (Note 5).\nThe solution is saturated with sodium chloride and distilled with steam until all the 2-chlorocyclopentanol is collected, which requires distillation of a volume of about 2 l. The distillate is saturated with sodium chloride, the oily layer separated, and the aqueous layer extracted four times with 300-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are added to the oil, and the solution is washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure through a total condensation, variable take-off, 15 by 1.5 cm. column packed with glass helices. A trap cooled with Dry Ice is placed in the vacuum line between the column and the pump. Low-boiling fractions, b.p. 43\u201381\u00b0/15 mm., amount to 19\u201340 g. (Note 6).

The bottle is connected to a calibrated low-pressure hydrogen tank and alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is then admitted to the system until the pressure is 1\u20132 atmospheres (15\u201330 lb.), and the bottle is shaken for 20\u201330 minutes to reduce the platinum oxide. The shaker is stopped, the bottle is evacuated, and air is admitted. Two hundred and twenty-six grams (1 mole) of diethyl cis-\u03944-tetrahydrophthalate is placed in the bottle.

The exothermic reaction is allowed to continue to completion without further application of heat. The isothiuronium salt is collected by filtration and dried. The salt melts with decomposition at 225\u2013227\u00b0 (Note 2) and weighs 1104 g.

            "Caution! This preparation should be carried out in a good hood, and it is advisable to use rubber gloves.\nIn a 5-l. flask surmounted by a water-cooled still head connected to a 30-in. spiral condenser set for downward distillation and connected to a well-cooled receiver (Note 1), 564 g. (4 moles) of \u03b2-aminoethylsulfuric acid (Note 2) is mixed with 1760 g. (1230 ml.) of 40% sodium hydroxide solution (704 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1056 ml. of water). The mixture is heated with a free flame until it just begins to boil. At this point external heating is discontinued (Note 3). The reaction that begins at the boiling point keeps the mixture boiling for several minutes. When this initial reaction has subsided, heating is resumed and about 500 ml. of distillate is collected as quickly as possible in the well-cooled receiver. To the chilled distillate 450\u2013500 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets is added gradually, whereupon the imine separates as an upper layer. The organic layers from four such 4-mole runs are combined and left overnight in a refrigerator over about 400 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets. The aqueous layers are combined and distilled through a wrapped 10-in. Vigreux column attached to a 30-in. spiral condenser. The distillate boiling at 50\u2013100\u00b0 is chilled thoroughly, and 200\u2013250 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets is added gradually. The upper layer of crude ethylenimine is separated and combined with the larger portion of base (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nIf an aqueous layer appears during drying of the combined organic layers, the upper layer (about 575\u2013600 g.) is again separated, 200 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets is added, and the whole is distilled through the same apparatus as that used for distilling the aqueous portion. If no layer appears, the base is decanted from the hydroxide and distilled from a fresh 200-g. portion of potassium hydroxide. The fraction boiling at 50\u2013100\u00b0 (about 350 g.) is collected and dried over 100 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets.\nThe crude ethylenimine is separated and dried over fresh 100-g. portions of potassium hydroxide until an aqueous layer no longer appears (Note 6). It is then decanted from the drying agent and redistilled from 100 g. of potassium hydroxide.\nThe yield of ethylenimine (b.p. 56\u201358\u00b0) is 235\u2013250 g. (34\u201337%). A stick of sodium hydroxide is added to act as a preservative, and the material is best stored in sealed bottles in a refrigerator (Note 7), (Note 8), and (Note 9)."

The flask is connected to a 1-l. suction flask receiver by means of a short 17-mm. i.d. 60\u00b0 elbow extending about 15 cm. into the receiver. The receiver is cooled by immersion in an ice bath or by cold running water. The system is evacuated to 15\u201330 mm. by means of a water aspirator. The flask is then heated with one or two burners, using large soft flames. Heating should be started at the side and moved toward the bottom as the reaction progresses (Note 6). The reaction mass froths and blackens, and the product distils and sublimes into the receiver. The elbow leading to the receiver must be heated occasionally to melt condensed fumaronitrile. Heating is continued until no more fumaronitrile distils from the reaction flask (1.5 to 2 hours) (Note 7). The product, usually white and sufficiently pure (m.p. 93\u201395\u00b0) for most purposes, is obtained in a yield of 125\u2013132 g. (80\u201385%).

(1.06 moles) of \u03b1-bromo-n-butyryl chloride diluted with approximately 40 ml. of dry benzene. The addition requires approximately 1 hour, and the reaction mixture becomes thick owing to the separation of methylaniline hydrochloride. The mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes and is then set aside protected by a calcium chloride tube for approximately 12 hours. The colorless methylaniline hydrochloride is removed by filtration with suction and washed with two 25-ml. portions of benzene. The combined filtrate and washings are washed with three 100-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid to remove excess methylaniline, and then with two 100-ml. portions of water (Note 7). The benzene layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the solvent is removed by distillation (the last traces of solvent are removed with an aspirator) to give N-methyl-\u03b1-bromo-n-butyranilide (Note 8).\nThe crude N-methyl-\u03b1-bromo-n-butyranilide is placed in a 500 ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg wire stirrer and a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. To the stirred liquid, cooled in an ice-water bath, is added 281 g. (2.1 moles) of aluminum chloride (reagent grade, powdered) in portions over a period of about 30 minutes (Note 9). A thermometer is then introduced, and the cooling bath is replaced by a source of heat (Note 10). The reaction commences at about 80\u00b0 with the evolution of hydrogen bromide (Note 11) and becomes very vigorous at 95\u2013105\u00b0. At this point, no external heat need be applied, because the heat of reaction carries the temperature to 110\u2013115\u00b0. When the reaction slows down, the temperature is raised to 160\u2013170\u00b0, and the dark mixture is then allowed to cool to about 80\u201390\u00b0. The reaction mixture is poured cautiously into a 3-l. beaker about one-fourth full of cracked ice. Additional ice is added as required. The last traces of product are removed from the flask with the aid of hydrochloric acid and ice. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (75 ml.) is added to aid the decomposition of the aluminum chloride complex. The brown oil is separated after adding 75 ml. of ether, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with two 75-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, two 100-ml, portions of water, two 75-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and two 100-ml. portions of water. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate the ether is distilled, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The main fraction is collected at 103\u2013107\u00b0/0.5 mm. The yield is 126\u2013131 g. (68\u201371% based on the acid chloride) of pale yellow 1-methyl-3-ethloxindole, nD25 1.5569\u20131.5580."

A 10\u201312 in. length of stout, flexible iron wire is passed through one of these pieces of tubing. Two liters of liquid ammonia (Note 2) and 2 g. of ferric nitrate hydrate are placed in the flask. One hundred grams of sodium (4.35 g. atoms) is cut into rectangular pieces about 3 by \u00be by \u00be in. in size. One of the pieces of sodium is hooked onto the lower end of the iron wire and lowered into the liquid ammonia. Stirring is not necessary during this part of the reaction, but it is advisable. When the lump of sodium has reacted, the solution turns from blue to gray, and the remaining pieces of sodium are added in the same manner. The addition requires about 45 minutes (Note 3).\nThe stopper carrying the iron wire is removed, 2 g. of anil is added, and then 528 g.

(0.81 mole) of diethyl benzalmalonate2 in 2 l. of absolute ethanol. The stirrer is started, and a solution of 56 g. (0.86 mole) of potassium cyanide in 100 ml. of water is added rapidly from the separatory funnel; a small amount of the potassium cyanide precipitates. The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 70\u00b0 and maintained at 65\u201375\u00b0 for 18 hours.\nThe mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0, and the precipitated potassium bicarbonate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid (weight 70\u201372 g.) is washed on the funnel with 100 ml. of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and wash liquor is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask and made slightly acid (Caution! (Note 1)) with dilute hydrochloric acid (about 15\u201320 ml. of the 10% acid is required). The solution is then concentrated under reduced pressure to a semi-solid residue (Note 1). The cooled residue is shaken with a mixture of 300 ml. of water and 500 ml. of ether. The material dissolves completely; the water layer is separated and washed with 200 ml. of ether. The ether solutions are combined, dried over 20 g. of calcium chloride, filtered into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a glass joint, and concentrated by distillation (heating on a steam bath). The crude ethyl \u03b2-phenyl-\u03b2-cyanopropionate remains as a clear red oil weighing 130\u2013140 g. It is sufficiently pure for use in the next step (Note 2).",

The mixture is allowed to stand for 15 minutes and then is cooled to about room temperature and 500 g. of sodium carbonate monohydrate (Note 2) is added. The quinoxaline separates as an oil or as a crystalline solid if the mixture is sufficiently cool. The mixture is extracted with three 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the steam bath.

            "B. 2,3-Pyrazinedicarboxylic acid. A 12-l. three-necked flask is provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 1-l. dropping funnel. In the flask are placed 4 l. of hot (about 90\u00b0) water and 145 g. (1.12 moles) of quinoxaline. With rapid stirring a saturated aqueous solution of 1050 g. (6.6 moles) of potassium permanganate (Note 4) is added through the dropping funnel in a thin stream. The rate of addition of the permanganate solution is adjusted so that the reaction mixture boils gently. The addition requires about 1.5 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled somewhat (Note 5) and filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The manganese dioxide cake is removed from the funnel and stirred to a smooth paste with 1 l. of fresh water. The slurry is filtered, and the washing is repeated. The total filtrate, about 10 l., is evaporated under reduced pressure on the steam bath to a volume of approximately 3 l. (Note 6). The solution is swirled or stirred gently while 550 ml. (6.6 moles) of 36% hydrochloric acid is cautiously added (Note 7). Evaporation under reduced pressure is then continued until a moist cake of solid potassium chloride and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid remains in the flask (Note 8).\nThe moist cake is scraped from the flask and allowed to dry in a 16-in. porcelain evaporating dish until the odor of hydrochloric acid is faint (about 24 hours, but this time can be reduced to about 8 hours if a gentle stream of air is directed onto the solid). The solid material is returned to the dried flask and mixed thoroughly with about 200 ml. of water. Two liters of acetone is added, and the mixture is boiled under reflux for 15 minutes, then cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 6-in. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid on the filter is returned to the flask, treated with 100 ml. of water, and extracted with 1 l. of boiling acetone as before (Note 9). The acetone filtrates are combined and distilled from a steam bath, finally under diminished pressure.\nThe solid in the flask is dissolved by refluxing with 2.5 l. of acetone. The mixture is cooled slightly, treated with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, refluxed for an additional 5-minute period, and filtered hot. Evaporation of the pale yellow acetone filtrate leaves the acid as a light-tan crystalline solid. If the product still possesses an odor of hydrochloric acid it is dried in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide pellets for a few hours. Finally the product is dried in an oven at 100\u00b0 for several hours (Note 10) and (Note 11). The yield of material melting at 165\u2013167\u00b0 (dec.) is 140\u2013145 g. (75\u201377%) (Note 12).\nIf a purer product is desired the material may be recrystallized (with about 17% loss) from 150 ml. of water; the hot solution is decolorized with carbon. The melting point after drying at 110\u00b0 for several hours is then 183\u2013185\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 11) and (Note 13)."

            "Eleven and one-half grams (0.5 g. atom) of sodium is dissolved in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. Forty-six grams (0.52 mole) of 2-nitropropane is added, then 92.5 g. (0.50 mole) of o-xylyl bromide (Note 1). The flask is attached to a reflux condenser connected to a drying tube and shaken at intervals for 4 hours. The reaction mixture, originally at room temperature, becomes warm spontaneously, and a white precipitate of sodium bromide forms (Note 2).\nAfter a reaction period of 4 hours the sodium bromide is separated by filtration and the ethanol is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue of product and sodium bromide is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether and 150 ml. of water. The ether layer is washed with two 50-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution to remove any acetoxime and excess 2-nitropropane and is then washed with 50 ml. of water. The ether layer is separated and is dried with 15 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath.\nThe crude product is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The yield of o-tolualdehyde boiling at 68\u201372\u00b0/6 mm., n25D 1.5430, is 41\u201344 g. (68\u201373%) (Note 3)."

            "A solution of 170 g. (1.0 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of water in a 2-l. beaker is treated, with stirring, with a solution of 44 g. (1.07 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water (Note 1). The mixture is stirred for 5 minutes, and the silver oxide is collected on an 11-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and washed free of nitrates with water (Note 2). The wet, freshly precipitated silver oxide is transferred to a 4-l. beaker (Note 1), covered with 2 l. of water, and treated with 200 g. (4.85 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets with vigorous stirring. If the temperature of the mixture at this point is below 55\u00b0, the mixture is warmed to 55\u201360\u00b0. With continued stirring at 55\u201360\u00b0 (Note 3), 152 g. (1.0 mole) of vanillin (Note 4) is added; the reaction begins after a few minutes. The silver oxide is transformed to fluffy metallic silver, and considerable heat is evolved. Stirring is continued for 10 minutes, the mixture is filtered, and the precipitated silver is washed with 100 ml. of hot water. A rapid stream of sulfur dioxide gas (Note 5) is passed into the combined filtrate and washings for 2 minutes, and the resulting solution is poured into 1.1 l. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid with vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture, which should be acid to Congo red, is cooled to 15\u201320\u00b0. The vanillic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed to remove the mother liquor, washed with 150 ml. of ice water (Note 6), sucked as dry as possible, and air-dried. The yield is 140\u2013160 g. (83\u201395%) of white needles melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0. This product is pure enough for most purposes, but it may be purified by recrystallization from water containing a little sulfur dioxide, 1.2 l. of water being used per 100 g. of product. Pure white needles melting at 210\u2013211\u00b0 are obtained with a recovery of 90\u201397%.",
            "In a stainless-steel beaker of approximately 2-l. capacity (120 mm. by 165 mm.) equipped with an efficient mechanical Nichrome or Monel stirrer (Note 1) and heated by an electric hot plate are placed 178 g. (4.3 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets, 178 g. (2.7 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets (Note 2), and 50 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and heated to 160\u00b0, at which temperature the hot plate is turned off. Twenty-five grams of vanillin is added. The temperature drops somewhat, and after a very short time a vigorous reaction begins which raises the temperature to 180\u2013195\u00b0. An additional 127 g. (total of 1.0 mole) of vanillin is gradually added to the reaction mixture during a period of 10\u201312 minutes at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature (Note 3). After all the vanillin has been added, stirring is continued for 5 minutes. The hot plate is removed, and the mixture is allowed to cool with stirring. When the mixture cools to about 150\u2013160\u00b0, 1 l. of water is added and the mixture is stirred until all the fusion mixture is dissolved. The solution is transferred to a 4-l. beaker, 500 ml. of water being used to rinse the stirrer and metal beaker. Sulfur dioxide gas is introduced for 1 minute (Note 4), and the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. The mixture is acidified with about 1.2 l. of 6N hydrochloric acid using Congo red as the indicator and keeping the mixture cool during addition of the acid by stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The mixture is cooled, and the light-tan precipitate is filtered, washed with 150 ml. of ice water, and dried. The yield of vanillic acid melting at 206\u2013208\u00b0 is 150\u2013160 g. (89\u201395%) (Note 5). The product can be recrystallized from water, using 1.2 l. per 100 g. of vanillic acid. A 90\u201397% recovery of nearly white vanillic acid melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0 is obtained."

            "In a 500-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask provided with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a gas inlet tube through which a stream of nitrogen is passed (Note 1) are placed 206 g. (2.4 moles) of freshly distilled vinyl acetate (Note 2) and 80 g. (0.4 mole) of lauric acid (Note 3). The lauric acid is dissolved by warming, and 1.6 g. of mercuric acetate is added. The mixture is shaken by hand for about 30 minutes, and 0.15 ml. of 100% sulfuric acid is added dropwise (Note 4). The solution is heated under reflux for 3 hours, then 0.83 g. of sodium acetate trihydrate is added to neutralize the sulfuric acid. The excess vinyl acetate is recovered by distillation at atmospheric pressure (vapor temperature about 70\u201380\u00b0) until the pot temperature reaches 125\u00b0 (Note 5). The distillation is completed at 10 mm. or lower (Note 5), and, after the collection of a small quantity of low-boiling material, fairly pure vinyl laurate (Note 6) is obtained as a colorless liquid, b.p. 142\u2013143\u00b0/10 mm. (138\u2013139\u00b0/8 mm.; 124\u2013126\u00b0/3 mm.). The yield is 50\u201357 g. (55\u201363%). Redistillation (Note 7) yields 48\u201353 g.
