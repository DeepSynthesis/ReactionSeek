            "The discovery of BINAP by Noyori and co-workers in 1980 ushered in an era of fertile research and practical applications of asymmetric catalysis using axially-chiral phosphine ligands.2 The first practical syntheses of (R)- and (S)-BINAP (4) were reported by Takaya et al in 1986 (Scheme 1), involving synthesis of the racemic bis-phosphine oxide, resolution with (R,R)-dibenzoyl tartaric acid, followed by reduction to the bis-phosphine.3 While this route supported production of kilogram quantities of BINAP, some drawbacks were the harsh conditions (320 \u00b0C) and low yield (45%) for conversion of 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) to the dibromide and a resolution in which the (S)-isomer could be isolated in high ee with (R,R)-dibenzoyl tartaric acid while the opposite enantiomer required an upgrade with (S,S)-dibenzoyl tartaric acid after recovery from the supernatant.\nBINOL Resolution\nA more concise approach to BINAP would be to start with resolved BINOL and develop mild conditions for conversion to BINAP such that the chiral integrity is not compromised. A number of viable methods for resolving BINOL have been developed over the past 40 years, including enzymatic hydrolysis of its diester, resolution of its phosphoric acid, and formation of a variety of diastereomeric salts and co-crystals with chiral bases.4 Given the wide availability of the Cinchona alkaloids, we decided to further investigate the resolution of BINOL discovered by Toda5using N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride 5 (Figure 1). This alkaloid forms a salt co-crystal with (R)-BINOL with the chloride serving as a bridge between the alkaloid and BINOL with three hydrogen bonds: one to an OH of BINOL, one to the OH of 5, and a third to an OH of a second molecule of BINOL.6\nFor most applications that employ Cinchona alkaloids, the two \"pseudo-enantiomeric\" pairs, cinchonine/cinchonidine and quinine/quinidine, lead to opposite product enantiomers since the pairs have opposite stereochemistry at the \"working\" part of the molecule, C8 and C9. For example, in the first practical resolution of BINOL, the phosphoric acid of BINOL is resolved using cinchonine and cinchonidine to access the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers, respectively.7 Surprisingly, however, N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride 5 and N-benzylcinchoninium chloride 6 both form salt co-crystals only with (R)-BINOL.8 Thus, to efficiently isolate both pure enantiomers of BINOL using either 5 or 6, a near perfect resolution is required, with one diastereomeric complex crystallizing in very high yield, leaving the other enantiomer with high enantiomeric purity in the supernatant.\nIn the published procedure of Toda,6 MeOH was used as the crystallization solvent, affording (R)-BINOL in high yield and ee (after breaking the complex) but leaving the (S)-enantiomer in the supernatant in only 42% ee. Thus, the pure (S)-enantiomer could not be isolated via this method. We initiated our studies of this resolution by undertaking a survey of solvents and identified MeCN as the most promising: 5 had reasonable solubility, the crystalline diastereomeric complex (R)-BINOL\u20225 had very low solubility at 0 \u00b0C, and no evidence was found for crystallization of BINOL\u20225 in this solvent. A straightforward resolution for isolating both enantiomers of BINOL in high yield was thus developed.9\nThe resolution was carried out with 0.55 equiv of 5 at a concentration of 80 g of BINOL per L of solvent. The mixture was refluxed for 4 h to ensure BINOL and 5 were fully dissolved, during which time crystallization of the (R)-BINOL\u20225 complex occurred. After cooling to 0 \u00b0C, the solids were filtered and washed with MeCN to afford (R)-BINOL\u20225 co-crystals with 96% de. The complex was upgraded to >99% de by slurrying in MeOH, then (R)-BINOL was recovered by salt break in EtOAc/aq. HCl. Concentration of the EtOAc layer to dryness afforded (R)-BINOL (85-88% recovery, >99% ee).\nThe supernatant from the original crystallization, which contained BINOL, was concentrated to dryness, then dissolved in EtOAc and washed with dilute HCl to remove any remaining 5. Concentration of the EtOAc layer to dryness afforded BINOL (89-93%, recovery, 99% ee). This straightforward resolution thus provides access to each enantiomer of BINOL in =99% ee with recoveries in the 85-93% range for each enantiomer.\nNearly concurrent with our 1995 publication, Pu reported a resolution with 5, isolating each enantiomer of BINOL in 70-75% yield.10 This group carried out the initial resolution in MeOH to crystallize (R)-BINOL\u20225. The supernatant was evaporated and the resulting solids slurried in EtOAc, affording additional crystalline (R)-BINOL\u20225 adduct, with the supernatant containing BINOL with 84% ee. The material from the supernatant was concentrated then further upgraded via crystallization from benzene.\nThree analogs of BINOL have been similarly resolved, 6,6'-dimethyl and 7,7'-dimethoxy using 511 and 7,7'-bis(benzyloxy) using quinine.12\nA 2005 review indicates the resolution with N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride described in our 1999 Organic Syntheses procedure remains among the most effective and straightforward methods of accessing both enantiomers of BINOL.4\nBINAP Synthesis\nIn parallel to the development of the BINOL resolution, a more efficient route to BINAP was explored. Five papers in the early 1990's provided the starting point for our efforts. Activation of BINOL as its bis-triflate 3 was reported by Mattay in 1990,13 then Morgans14a and Hayashi14b discovered that mono-phosphorylation of bis-triflate 3 could be accomplished using Ph2P(O)H and Pd catalysis, noting the reaction occurred stereospecifically with no loss of ee. In addition, cyanation could also be achieved using nickel catalysis, affording primarily mono-substituted product with up to 10% of the bis-nitrile.14a Snieckus reported conversion of bis-triflate 3 to the bis-methyl derivative using MeMgBr with Ni catalysis.15 While no aryl triflate to aryl phosphine couplings were known at the time we began our work, cross-couplings of aryl iodides with phosphine-boranes, prepared from the corresponding phosphine oxide and LiAlH4-NaBH4, were reported by Imamoto using Pd catalysis.16\nIn considering the direct cross-coupling of diphenylphosphine with bis-triflate 3, a transition-metal catalyst must be chosen that will not be poisoned by ligation to the phosphine ligands present in the starting material and product. The 2nd and 3rd row transition metals such as Pd, Rh, Ru, and Pt were thus ruled out, with Ni identified as having the best probability of success given its \"hardness\" and likely only weak ligation to phosphines. Screening identified a number of Ni catalysts that gave some conversion to product, with NiCl2(dppe) selected for further development. The optimized procedure used 10 mol % catalyst, 4 equiv DABCO, 2.4 equiv Ph2PH and DMF as solvent. The reaction required 2-3 days at 100 \u00b0C to reach completion. BINAP crystallized directly from the reaction mixture, providing product in 77% yield (97 % purity (HPLC area), >99% ee).17\nSince our original report in 1994, applications of this methodology to several BINAP analogs for various applications have been reported (Table 1). The 6-Me, 6-MeO2C, and 7-MeO analogs (Table 1, entries 1-3) were prepared according to the same procedure except the cross-coupling reactions were completed overnight rather than 2-3 days.11 Several fluorous analogs have been prepared in 48-87% yields (Table 1, entries 4-7).18, 19, 20 The bis-steroid ligand (Table 1, entry 8) was readily prepared from the natural product equilenine. The resulting diastereomers could be separated by column chromatography, eliminating the need for a resolution.21 The electron-rich BINAP analog (Table 1, entry 11) was prepared in a modest 26% yield, but was found to afford superior ee's in the Rh-catalyzed asymmetric 1,4-addition of arylboron reagents to 5,6-dihydro-2(1H)-pyridones to prepare 4-aryl-2-piperidones.23 While most of the coupling partners in Table 1 are arylphosphines, Wills reported preparation of the bis(dicyclohexylphosphine) analog in 45% yield from Cy2PH by a modified procedure utilizing Zn dust as an additional reagent (Table 1, entry 13).25 Attempts to prepare the bis(di-t-butylphosphine) analog were unsuccessful, with only the mono-substitution product formed.25 Gilheany also reported formation of the mono-substituted product using t-BuPhPH in 40% yield.26 Ni- and Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings of Ar2PH with triflates to prepare mono-phosphine BINAP analogs, as well as non-BINAP structures, have also been reported but are outside the scope of this addendum.27\nAlternate Methods to Prepare BINAP and Analogs27\nA number of alternate methods of preparing BINAP and analogs have been reported in the past two decades.\nCross Coupling of bis-Triflate 3 with Other Phosphorus Partners (Scheme 2). Takasago scientists reported a synthesis of BINAP via cross-coupling of bis-triflate 3 with Ph2P(O)H, citing the ease of handling the phosphine oxide vs the phosphine (pyrophoric, stench) as the principle driver.28 Employing the same NiCl2(dppe) catalyst that was used in the Merck procedure, the cross-coupling affords a mixture of BINAP analog 9 (35%), the mono-oxide 8 (60%), and the bis-oxide (4%). The mixture is then treated with HSiCl3/PhNMe2 to reduce all species to the BINAP analog. This method has been applied to a number of analogs, including 2-napthyl, 4-tolyl, 3,5-dimethylphenyl, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl, and 4-t-butoxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl. Yields from BINOL range from 57-84%.28\nCross-coupling of bis-triflate 3 with Ar2P(O)H and R2P(O)H using Pd-catalysis stop at the mono-phosphine oxide 7, leaving an unreacted triflate that can be further functionalized using Pd- or Ni-catalysis to prepare unsymmetrical BINAP analogs.27\nAlso using NiCl2(dppe) catalyst, Laneman at Monsanto reported coupling of the bis-triflate 3 with Ph2PCl, mediated by 1.2-1.5 equiv Zn, affording a yield of BINAP of 52%.29 The authors proposed that Zn plays two roles, reducing Ni(II) to Ni(0) as well as generating Ph2PZnCl as the active species. This process has been reportedly licensed to Rhodia for commercial production.27b In a slight variation of this process, Waechtler used the -SO2C4F9 analog for the cross-coupling with Ph2PCl.30\nYu found that BINAP analogs with electron-rich aromatic groups could be prepared by the Merck process with bis-triflate 3 in moderate yields (Table 1, entries 9, 10), but that electron-withdrawing analogs were unreactive. However, using Ar2PBr 11 instead of the chloride 10, the method could be extended to 4-CF3 (33% yield) and 3,5-(CF3)2 (28% yield) analogs and yields of the electron-donating analogs could be increased 10-15%.22\nA wide-variety of electron-rich phosphines have been prepared by cross-coupling phosphine borane species 12 with bis-triflate 3 in yields ranging from 24-79%.31, 32 The use of conditions and reaction times very similar to the Merck process suggest the reaction may be proceeding via a common intermediate.\nCross Coupling of bis-Bromide with Ar2PBr. Yu reported the racemic bis-bromide of BINOL could be converted to the corresponding Grignard species and cross-coupled with Ar2PBr, requiring no catalyst. Five examples were reported, affording yields of 68-78% for both electron-withdrawing and donating groups. Under these conditions, Ar2PCl was unreactive.22\nOxidative Homo-Coupling. Takasago scientists designed and prepared a family of ligands termed SEGPHOS, which have a smaller dihedral angle than BINAP and show superior performance in a number of applications. The preparation of this ligand is shown in Scheme 3, featuring an iron-mediated homo-coupling to generate the bis-phosphine oxide (R,S)-15, followed by resolution to (R)-15, and reduction to (R)-SEGPHOS (16).33\nIn summary, axially-chiral ligands, introduced by Noyori and co-workers in 1980, have played an important role in the development of asymmetric catalysis for organic synthesis. A number of practical routes to BINAP and analogs have made a wide variety of these ligands available for application in academic settings as well as industrial processes."

            "Allenamides, especially chiral allenamides, are important synthetic intermediates and exist as key structural motifs in many natural products. We recently reported an efficient route to the formation of chiral allenamides that relied upon the isomerization of chiral propargylic oxazolidinones for the introduction of the chiral allenamide functionality.2 More recently, the stereospecific amidation of optically enriched allenyl iodides using catalytic copper(I) salt and N,N-dimethylethylene-diamine as ligands has emerged as a facile strategy to access chiral allenamides3 (Scheme 1). In recent years, major advances in allenamide chemistry have been concerned with the applications of chiral allenamides to stereoselective synthesis. These advances will be summarized in this article.\n\n(I) CYCLIZATION REACTIONS\nThe ability of \u03b3-substituted allenamides to undergo cyclization reactions4 using either stoichiometric TBAF or catalytic PPTS affords stereodivergent syntheses of 2,5-disubstituted dihydrofurans (Scheme 2). The resulting products were then subjected to stereoselective dihydroxylations demonstrating the synthetic utility of chiral allenamides in the stereoselective synthesis of complex molecules.\nCyclization of allenamides can also proceed via a radical mechanism5 using a combination of AlBN and n-Bu3SnH (Scheme 3). The radical addition reactions are highly selective for the central carbon of the allene, leading to an efficient preparation of nitrogen heterocycles such as isoquinolines, and carbocycles such as indane and naphthalene derivatives. The exo-cyclization mode could also be achieved in some cases, leading to the synthesis of isoindoles.\n(II) CYCLOADDITION REACTIONS\nA) [2\u03c0 + 1\u03c0] CYCLOADDITIONS\nThe Simmons-Smith cyclopropanations6 of chiral allenamides provides a viable strategy to obtain optically enriched amido-spiro [2.2] pentanes (Scheme 4). This reaction was efficient with good substrate generality, and represents the most direct synthesis of both chemically and biologically interesting amido-spiro [2.2] pentane systems. However, it suffers from poor diastereoselectivities for unsubstituted chiral allenamides. For a-substituted allenamides, the diastereoselectivity was improved, but both mono- and bis-cyclopropanation products were observed.\n\nB) [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] CYCLOADDITIONS\nAn inverse electron-demand aza [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition7 was observed in the reaction of chiral allenamides with 1-azadienes (Scheme 5). In addition, it was also possible to promote a stereoselective intramolecular normal demand [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition8 under thermal conditions without the need for metal catalysts (Scheme 6). Both of these works are applicable for the construction of highly functionalized aza-sugars and related nitrogen heterocycles synthesis.\nC) [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] CYCLOADDITIONS\nThe first intramolecular [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition9 using nitrogen-stabilized chiral oxyallyl cations10 was observed in the epoxidation of N-tethered allenamides (Scheme 7). The origin of the high selectivities for the oxyallyl cycloadditions was postulated to originate from structure of the nitrogen-stabilized chiral oxyallyl cation intermediate. This strategy was expanded to include the chemoselective epoxidation of allenamides tethered to either \u03b1 or \u03b3 carbon atom of dienes11 followed by the tandem [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition step (Scheme 8).\nA highly enantioselective version of this [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition was promoted by catalytic amounts of a chiral Lewis acid complex generated from Cu(OTf)2 and C2-symmetric bisoxazolines as ligands.12 High enantioselectivities were obtained when either unsubstituted or substituted furans were employed as the dienes (Scheme 9).\nMechanistically, it had been rationalized that the observed stereoselectivity for the intermolecular [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition between nitrogen-stabilized oxyallyl cation and furan is a result of the furan approaching in a favorable endo manner from the less hindered bottom or endo-I face of the oxyallyl cation. This preference can be further enhanced with a bidentate metal cation such as Zn that can chelate to both the oxyallyl oxygen atom and the oxazolidinone carbonyl oxygen (Scheme 10).\nHowever, an unexpected reversal of diastereoselectivity was observed when methyl 2-furoate was employed as the diene with nitrogen-stabilized oxyallyl cation.13 This intriguing reversal in favor of the endo-II cycloaddition pathway is likely a result of the transition state minimizing the dipole interaction between the oxyallyl cation and ester carbonyl of methyl 2-furoate (Scheme 11).\nBased on density functional theory calculations, it was further established that the stereo-induction for the [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition between oxyallyl cation and unsubstituted furan is due to the stabilizing CH-p interactions between the incoming furan and the Ph group on the oxyallyl isomer (Scheme 12). These CH-p interactions cause the cycloaddition to take place preferentially via the morecrowded face of the oxazolidinone to afford the product with the stereochemistry resulting from the addition via endo I-face.14 In the case of methyl-2-furoate, the reversal of stereoselectivity can be ascribed to the repulsive interactions between the Ph group and the 2-COOMe group which outweighs the stabilizing effect of the CH-p interactions. As such, cycloaddition takes place preferentially through the less crowded transition state affording a product with stereochemistry that can be explained by endo II-facial attack.\nThis [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition reaction was further expanded to include the reactions between oxazolidinone-substituted oxyallyl groups and unsymmetrically substituted furans.15 Syn regioselectivity was observed when the furan has a 2-Me or 2-COOR substituent, while anti regioselectivity is obtained with a 3-Me or 3-COOR group (Scheme 13).\nFinally, a practical and diastereoselective intramolecular [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition of N-sulfonyl substituted oxyallyl cations with furans was also reported (Scheme 14). Selectivity is found to depend on the tethering length as well as the stability of the oxyallyl cation intermediate, whether generated from N-carbamoyl- or N-sulfonyl-substituted allenamides.16 The use of chiral N-sulfonyl-substituted allenamide provided minimal diastereoselectivity in the cycloaddition, while high diastereoselectivity can be achieved with a stereocenter present on the tether.\nIII. ISOMERIZATION REACTIONS\nThe ability of allenamides to undergo regio- and stereoselective 1,3-hydrogen shift under both acidic and thermal conditions, leads to the de novo preparations of 2-amido-dienes.17 This process could be rendered in tandem with a 6\u03c0 -electron pericyclic ring closure to access cyclic 2-amido-dienes in good overall yields directly from the respective allenamides (Scheme 15). Further broadening of the scope of this isomerization reaction leads to the development of a new torquoselective ring-closure of chiral amide-substituted 1,3,5-hexatrienes and its application in tandem with [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition<18 (Scheme 16). The trienes were derived via either a 1,3-hydrogen or 1,3-H-1,7-hydrogen shift of a-substituted allenamides, and the entire sequence through the [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition could be promoted in tandem.\nThe efforts reported thus far unveiled an invaluable opportunity not only to develop a new and attractive template for conducting stereoselective 6p-electrocyclic ring-closures, but also to achieve a highly challenging 1,6-asymmetric induction. Indeed, a diastereoselective 6\u03c0-electrocyclic ring-closure employing halogen-substituted 3-amidotrienes via a 1,6-remote asymmetric induction was subsequently reported19 (Scheme 17). This new asymmetric manifold for pericyclic ring-closure further underscores the significance of the allenamide chemistry.\nIn addition, 1,3-hydrogen shifts using allenamide20 is also applicable to the preparation of acyclic 2-amido-dienes and 3-amido-trienes. Additionally, 6\u03c0-electron electrocyclic ring-closure could be carried out using 3-amido-trienes to afford cyclic 2-amido-dienes, and such electrocyclic ring-closure could be rendered in tandem with the 1,3-hydrogen shift, thereby constituting a facile construction of synthetically rare cyclic 2-amido-dienes (Scheme 18).\nFinally, a new approach to Oppolzer's intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition [IMDA] through \u03b3-isomerization21 of readily available N-tethered allenamides is described. These IMDA reactions are carried out in tandem with the allenamide isomerization or 1,3-hydrogen shift, leading to complex nitrogen heterocycles in a highly stereoselective manner (Scheme 19).\n(IV) NATURAL PRODUCT SYNTHESIS\nThe synthetic usefulness of the stereoselective inverse electron-demand [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition using chiral allenamide was demonstrated in the formal synthesis of (+)-zincophorin. This effort describes the preparation of the Miyashita's intermediate which features the first synthetic application of a stereoselective inverse electron demand hetero [4\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition of a chiral allenamide and an interesting urea directed Stork-Crabtree hydrogenation (Scheme 20).22 This approach was subsequently applied for the construction of the Cossy's C1-C9 subunit of (+)-zincophorin23, which also led to the observation of an unusual urea directed Stork-Crabtree hydrogenation (Scheme 21). It is noteworthy that these works represent the first application of chiral allenamides in natural product synthesis.\nFinally, a highly stereoselective [4\u03c0 + 3\u03c0] cycloaddition of N-substituted pyrroles with allenamide-derived nitrogen-stabilized chiral oxyallyl cations was reported which could serve as a useful approach towards the construction of the aza-tricyclic core of parvineostemonine24 (Scheme 22)."

The black reaction mixture is placed in a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C, bath temp.) and allowed to stir for 24 h. After confirming the completion of the reaction by TLC monitoring (hexanes:EtOAc, 20:1, Rf = 0.30 distinct blue spot under a UV lamp (254 nm)), the reaction mixture is diluted with 100 mL of chloroform and transferred to a 1 L round-bottomed flask. Saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (150 mL) is added slowly via a glass funnel and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until no gas evolution is visible. The mixture is then transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel and washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (2 x 100 mL) (Note 10) and brine (1 x 100 mL). The aqueous layer is back-extracted with chloroform (1 x 150 mL). The combined organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 (20 g, approx. 15 min). The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated by rotary evaporation (15\u201320 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) to give a brown oil, which is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 11) to afford ethyl 3-butyl-4-oxo-2-p-tolyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline-1(2H)-carboxylate 3 (trans:cis = 20:1, based on integral ratio of 1H NMR) as a slightly yellow oil (11.39 g, 78%) (Note 12)."

The flask is cooled to -20 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in a cooling bath (i-PrOH/dry-ice). Potassium tert-butoxide (3.53 g, 31.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) is added slowly to the solution of \u03b2-tetralone over 10 min (Note 3). After completing the addition, the mixture is warmed to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath and stirred for 1 h. Afterward, the dark-blue solution is cooled to -20 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in a cooling bath (i-PrOH/dry-ice). After the septum is removed, N-phenylbis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (10.7 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 1) is added over 1 min to the solution under a positive pressure of argon. Argon is immediately flushed into the flask and a new rubber septum is inserted. The mixture is warmed to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath and stirred for 4 h. At this point, full conversion to the product is confirmed by TLC analysis (Note 4), and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, ca. 100 mmHg) to approximately one-fourth of the original volume in a rotary evaporator. The resulting mixture is diluted with EtOAc (80 mL) and H2O (80 mL), and the layers are then partitioned in a 500-mL separatory funnel (Note 5). The aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (80 mL \u00d7 2). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (80 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (50 g) (Note 1), filtered through a 75 mL medium-porosity fritted funnel, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, ca. 60 mmHg) to afford a black solid. The obtained residue is purified by column chromatography (SiO2, hexane/EtOAc 100/1) (Note 6) to afford 7.75-8.09 g (93-97%, 27.8-29.0 mmol) of product 2 (Notes 7 and 8).",

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (40 x 20 mm), rubber septa (both side necks) and a reflux-condenser (center neck). The reflux-condenser is fitted with a rubber septum and an argon inlet needle. The flask is charged with formic acid (18.9 mL, 500 mmol, 5.00 equiv) and acetic anhydride (37.8 mL, 400 mmol, 4.00 equiv) (Note 1). The mixture in the flask is heated to 60 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an oil bath and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, the mixture is cooled to 0 \u00baC in an ice-water bath. Toluene (300 mL) (Note 2), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (5) (19.7 g, 100 mmol, 1.00 equiv), and sodium acetate (8.20 g, 100 mmol, 1.00 equiv) are added to the solution (Notes 1 and 9). After 10 min, the ice-water bath is removed and the reaction is warmed to room temperature. During this time, a white precipitate gradually appears. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at room temperature. At this point, full conversion to the product is confirmed by TLC analysis (Note 4), and H2O (100 mL) is added to the solution, resulting in the dissolution of the white precipitate.

The flask is evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. An oven-dried, 50-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 3,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2) (5.57 g, 20.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and equipped with a rubber septa and an argon inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. Then, toluene (20 mL) (Note 2) is added to the flask via a syringe. The triflate solution is added to the 300-mL flask via a gastight syringe. Toluene (10 mL x 2) (Note 2) is added to the 50-mL flask to wash its interior, and the washing is transferred to the 300-mL flask via the same syringe. After the mixture is stirred for 5 min at ambient temperature, triethylamine (3.33 mL, 24.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) (Note 1) is added over 15 min via a syringe (Note 13). During the addition of triethylamine, a slightly exothermic reaction ensues with gas evolution, and the brown color changes to black. After completing the addition, the mixture is stirred for another 2 h. At this point, full conversion to the product is confirmed by TLC analysis (Note 4), and the mixture is diluted with Et2O (100 mL) and H2O (100 mL).

One neck of the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser (Note 1) and another neck is closed with a rubber septum. The flask is evacuated and then back-filled with dry N2, a process that is performed three times.

The suspension is then stirred (Note 5) until dissolution is observed, at which point the solution is then cooled to between -30 \u00b0C and -35 \u00b0C using an acetone/dry ice bath (Note 6). Trifluoroacetic acid (3.06 mL, 40 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added drop-wise over a period of 10 min via syringe pump and plastic syringe (Note 7) and stainless steel needle (20 gauge). The solution is then stirred for a further 0.5 h keeping the temperature between -30 \u00b0C and -35 \u00b0C before the reaction flask is removed from the acetone/dry ice bath and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. At this point the solution is clear and colorless in appearance. Phenylacetylene (2.20 mL, 20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is then added to the solution by syringe, as above, over a period of 10 min, and the reaction vessel is wrapped in aluminium foil and stirred in darkness (Note 8) for 3.5 h (Notes 9 and 10) at room temperature. The resulting clear pale yellow solution is then transferred to a 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated to a volume of 30\u201340 mL (Note 11) in vacuo on a rotary evaporator, keeping the water bath at 25 \u00b0C. Diethyl ether (40 mL) followed by petroleum ether 40\u201360 (80 mL) are then added to the solution, mixing by 'swirling' manually, to initiate crystallization of the product, visible by the appearance of a white precipitate. The suspension is then stoppered before being wrapped in foil, placed in the freezer and kept in darkness at -25 \u00b0C for 48 h (Note 12). The flask is then removed from the freezer and left for 30 min to warm to room temperature before filtration of the white crystalline solid by suction using a medium-porosity sintered glass funnel and washed with diethyl ether (2 x 15 mL), agitating the crystals quickly with a spatula before the removal of each portion of diethyl ether (Note 13). The solid is then transferred to a pre-weighed vial and dried in vacuo for 12\u201324 h in a vacuum desiccator to give the product as a white crystalline solid 3.98 \u2013 4.59 g, (48 \u2013 55%) (Notes 14 and 15). Purity of the product can be determined by 1H NMR initially, though, due to decomposition in solution (Notes 9 and 10), elemental analysis provides a more accurate indication of purity (Note 16). The described procedure has also been shown to be suitable for larger scale syntheses (Note 17)."

The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 10 min, resulting in a homogeneous brown solution (Note 3). Deionized water (50 mL) is added (Note 4); then phenylacetylene (3.07 g, 30 mmol, 0.6 equiv) (Note 5) and ethyl vinyl ketone (6.31 g, 75 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 6) are added successively via syringe (Note 7). The solution is stirred vigorously (Note 8). With the flask equipped with a stopper, additional phenylacetylene (2.04 g, 20 mmol, 0.4 equiv) is added slowly at a rate of 0.4 mL/min. At the same time, the flask is heated in an oil bath and kept at 60 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature) for 48 h with the color of the solution gradually becoming darker during the course of the reaction (Note 9). Upon completion of the reaction the color of the solution turns dark brown.

This liquid appears to be pure by 1H and 13CNMR spectra (Note 15). Further purification is achieved by distillation at reduced pressure (120 \u00b0C/ 1 mmHg) (Note 16), which provided the product as a colorless liquid (6.20 g, 66%) (Note 17)."

The center neck is fitted with a Claisen adapter to which is attached a 50 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped with a rubber septum on one joint and reflux condenser with a N2 inlet on the other. The right neck is capped with a rubber septum (Note 2). The glass stopper is removed and the flask is charged with sodium hydride (6.00 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv, 60% dispersion in mineral oil) (Note 3). The glass stopper is replaced and the flask is purged for 10 min with N2 with a vent needle on the right rubber septum. After the addition of THF (200 mL) (Note 4) by syringe through the right rubber septum, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 10 min to give a grey suspension. The right rubber septum is then replaced with a glass stopper. 2-Tetralone (13.4 mL, 14.8 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is then transferred to the addition funnel via syringe and subsequently added dropwise from the addition funnel to the NaH suspension over a period of 8 min. During the addition of 2-tetralone, H2 gas evolves while the reaction mixture becomes warm to the touch and turns into an opaque yellow suspension (Note 6). The addition funnel is then rinsed with an additional portion of THF (10 mL) (Note 7). After stirring the reaction mixture for 30 min, pivaloyl chloride (18.6 mL, 18.3 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 8) is added dropwise to the yellow suspension from the same addition funnel over a period of 10 min.

After stirring the reaction for an additional 30 min, TLC analysis indicated the consumption of starting material (Product Rf=0.35, 5% EtOAc in hexanes, visualized under 254 nm UV light (Note 10)). One of the glass stoppers is then removed and water (2.0 mL) is added dropwise using a pipette (Note 9). After H2 release subsides, water (98 mL) is added followed by ethyl acetate (50 ml). The mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min and then transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel giving a yellow organic layer and a clear, colorless aqueous layer. The layers are separated.

The combined organic phases are washed with 5% aqueous NaOH solution (2 x 100 mL of a solution prepared with 10.5 g NaOH in 200 mL water) and with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (2 x 100 mL). The yellow organic phase is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and gravity filtered through a cotton plug and the filtrate collected in a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The Na2SO4 is rinsed with EtOAc (2 x 25 mL). The combined organics are concentrated under reduced pressure (190 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C) to provide a dark brown-yellow oil. The crude oil is loaded onto a fritted chromatography column (8.0 cm outer diameter) that had been dry-packed with silica gel (300 g) (Note 10) and wetted with hexanes under air pressure. The crude product is eluted with 900 mL of hexanes followed by 2000 mL of CH2Cl2:hexanes (30:70) and the eluent is collected in 700 mL fractions in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks (Note 11).

The flask is charged with 3,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl pivalate (11.3 mL, 11.5 g, 50 mmol, 1.0 equiv), which is added by 12 mL syringe, and THF (70.0 mL) (Note 4), which is also added by syringe. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (20.1 \u00b0C) for 20 min after which the dark brown suspension is moved to an ice-salt bath and cooled to \u20134.1 \u00b0C (Note 15). n-HexylMgCl (50.0 mL of a 2.0 M solution in THF, 100 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 16) is added dropwise by 60 mL plastic syringe over a period of 43 min using a syringe-pump set to a rate of 1.16 mL/min so as to maintain an internal temperature between \u20135 \u00b0C and 0 \u00b0C. Upon addition of the Grignard reagent, the reaction mixture turned brown-yellow in color and over the course of the addition became a darker brown-yellow solution.\nAfter the addition of Grignard reagent, the solution is allowed to stir for 1.5 h in the ice-water bath before quenching the reaction with 1.0 M aqueous HCl (3.0 mL) (Product Rf=0.46, hexanes, visualized under 254 nm UV light) (Note 10). After 1 min, an additional 70 mL of aqueous 1.0 M HCl solution is added during which time a slight exotherm is observed. The mixture is warmed to 25 \u00b0C and 20 mL EtOAc is then added (Note 17). The mixture is vigorously stirred for 15 min and then transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel. The layers are allowed to separate over a period of 30 min into a red/brown organic layer and a faintly red aqueous layer. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer extracted with EtOAc (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (2 x 50 mL) and subsequently dried over MgSO4. The solution is gravity filtered through a plug of cotton into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The MgSO4 is then washed with EtOAc (2 x 25 mL), and the combined filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (190 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C, 150 rpm).\nThe crude product is purified by column chromatography. A fritted chromatography column (8.0 cm outer diameter) is dry-packed with 180.0 g of silica gel (Note 10) and wetted with hexanes under air pressure. The crude oil is loaded directly onto the column and the solvent front lowered to the top of the silica gel. The flask is then washed twice with 5 mL portions of hexanes and then loaded onto the column with the solvent front lowered to the top of the silica gel. A 1.0 cm layer of sand is placed on top of the column. Hexanes (950 mL) is used as an eluent, which is collected as 2 x 100 mL fractions, then a 50 mL fraction, and then 7 x 100 mL fractions. Fractions 4-10 are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (190 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C, 150 rpm) to afford 3-hexyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene as a clear colorless oil (10.3 g, 96%) (Note 18)."

            "A. 3-Buten-1-yn-1-yl-benzene (1). An oven-dried 1-L, three-necked (2 x 29/32 and 1 x 14.5/23 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (55 x 8 mm), equipped with three rubber septa and a contact thermometer inserted through the rubber septa in the center neck, is charged with bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (2.81 g, 4.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 1) and copper(I) iodide (0.38 g, 2.00 mmol, 0.01 equiv.). The flask is then purged with argon, followed by the addition of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) (Note 2) and vinyl bromide (1 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 200 mL, 200 mmol). The solution is then cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice bath. Triethylamine (70.0 mL, 500 mmol, 2.5 equiv) is added over the course of 90 sec, which is followed by the addition of phenylacetylene (23.0 mL, 210 mmol, 1.05 equiv) over the course of 30 sec, at which time the solution turns black (Note 3). The solution stirs for 1 h at 0 \u00b0C, after which the ice bath is removed and the solution is stirred at room temperature for an additional 12 h (Note 4).\nThe reaction is diluted with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (300 mL), and the resulting solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed sequentially with 10% aqueous HCl solution (200 mL) and saturated NaCl solution (200 mL). The organic layer is then dried over MgSO4 (20 g), filtered through a 250-mL coarse porosity sintered glass funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The resulting oil is transferred to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (25 x 6 mm). The product is distilled under vacuum through a 12 cm Vigreux column equipped with a short path distilling head with Vigreux indentations connected to a spider (3 x 14.5/23 joint). The sample is placed under vacuum (3.7 mmHg) and the temperature is slowly increased until distillation commences. A forerun (ca. 1 mL) is collected and discarded, and the desired product is then obtained, distilling at 63\u201365 \u00b0C (3.7 mmHg) to yield pure 1 as a colorless oil (19.4-22.2 g, 151-173 mmol, 75-86%) (Notes 5 and 6 ).",
            "B. (\u00b1)-(E)-2-Hydroxy-1,3-diphenylhexa-3,5-dien-1-one (2).2 An oven-dried, 100-mL one-necked (29/32 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (14 x 6 mm) is purged with argon, and bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.80 g, 1.70 mmol, 0.020 equiv), (\u00b1)-BINAP (1.17 g, 1.88 mmol, 0.022 equiv), and anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (50 mL) (Note 7) are added. The solution is purged with argon for 15 min. A separate oven-dried 500-mL, one-necked (29/32 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (38 x 7 mm) is purged with argon, and phenylglyoxal monohydrate (13.0 g, 85.4 mmol) (Note 7), 1 (16.3 g, 127.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv), and anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (200 mL) (Note 8) are added. This suspension is purged with argon for 15 min, and the solution containing the rhodium catalyst is transferred to this flask via cannula over the course of 20 min (Note 9). The resulting mixture is then purged with hydrogen gas for 30 min, during which time the cloudy suspension dissolves (Notes 10 and 11). The reaction is then stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere for 40 h (Note 12), until TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of phenylglyoxal.\nThe solution is then purged with nitrogen for 20 min and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg). The residue is purified by column chromatography (20% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to yield (\u00b1)-(E)-2-hydroxy-1,3-diphenylhexa-3,5-dien-1-one (2) (19.6 g, 74.3 mmol, 87%) as a thick orange oil (Notes 13, 14 and 15).",
            "C. (\u00b1)-Dimethyl-2-((5-hydroxy-4-oxo-3,5-diphenylcyclopent-2-en-1-yl)methyl) malonate (4). To an oven-dried, 100-mL one-necked (29/32 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (27 x 5 mm) is added 2 (9.0 g, 34.1 mmol) as a solution in DMSO (27 mL), followed by 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (14.3 g, 51.1 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in one portion (Notes 16 and 17). The cloudy suspension is allowed to stir while open to air. The suspension is stirred until TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of alcohol 2 (usually 15 min) (Note 18). The solution is then diluted with water (200 mL), transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, and extracted with diethyl ether (5 x 150 mL) (Note 19). The combined ether extracts are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (150 mL), dried over MgSO4 (30 g), filtered through a 250 mL coarse porosity sintered glass funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg). (E)-1,3-Diphenylhexa-3,5-diene-1,2-dione (3) is obtained as a yellow oil, which is used in the next step without further purification (Note 20).\nAn oven-dried 250-mL, one-necked (29/32 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (27 x 5 mm) is charged with yttrium (III) triflate (0.18 g, 0.34 mmol, 0.01 equiv) and lithium chloride (2.89 g, 68.2 mmol, 2 equiv), after which tetrahydrofuran (68 mL), triethylamine (4.75 mL, 34.1 mmol, 1 equiv), and dimethyl malonate (4.87 mL, 42.6 mmol, 1.25 equiv) are added. The suspension is stirred at room temperature and left open to air. Diketone 3, as a solution in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran, is added rapidly over 10 sec (Note 21). The reaction turns from yellow to dark red and is stirred until TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of diketone (3), which typically requires 5 min (Note 22).\nThe reaction is then quenched by the addition of 1M aqueous HCl solution (50 mL) over 5 min and the resulting solution is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 40 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with 50 mL of saturated NaCl solution, dried over 20 g of MgSO4, filtered through a 250-mL coarse porosity sintered glass funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Purification by column chromatography (33.3% ethyl acetate/hexanes) yields 4 (9.93 g, 25.2 mmol, 74%) as a pale yellow solid (Notes 23 and 24)."

The mixture is dissolved in MeCN (60 mL), and the resulting solution is stirred (700 rpm) at 22 \u00b0C with the temperature maintained by a water bath. tert-Butyl nitrite (tBuONO, 6.17 g, 53.8 mmol, 1.36 equiv) diluted by MeCN (40 mL) is then added via an addition funnel over a 1 h time period (Notes 3 and 4). The solution is allowed to stir at 23 \u00b0C for an additional 4 h, with the temperature maintained by a water bath (Note 5). Upon complete consumption of 1 as indicated by TLC analysis, the resulting solution is concentrated with a rotary evaporator to remove MeCN (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) (Note 6). The crude residue is filtered over a flash silica gel plug (60 g) eluting with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate (20:1, 750 mL) until TLC analysis shows that no product 2 is still eluting from the silica gel (Note 7). The filtrate is then concentrated with a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg), and the residue is further purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with approximately 500 mL petroleum ether until product emerges as indicated by TLC, and then eluting with approximately 1000 mL of petroleum ether-ethyl acetate (100:1)(Note 8). The combined eluents are concentrated with a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and further evaporated with an oil vacuum pump for 30 min at room temperature to afford the product 2 (7.10\u20137.32 g, 72\u201374%) as a pale yellow solid (Note 9), which was >97% pure as determined by GC analysis (Note 10)."

A 1-L three-necked round-bottomed flask is sequentially charged with N-chlorosuccinimide (133.5 g, 1000 mmol, 4 equiv) (Note 5) and MeCN (400 mL) (Note 6). The flask is immersed into a 10 \u00b0C water bath (\u03a6 = 24.5 cm, h = 16 cm) and equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (paddle size: w = 8 cm, h = 1.5 cm), a thermometer fitted with a thermometer adapter and an addition funnel. After addition of 2 M HCl (70 mL), the addition funnel was exchanged with a solid-addition funnel. After the mixture is cooled to about 10 \u00b0C, the ground S-benzyl isothiouronium chloride solid (50.7 g, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) is slowly added through the solid addition funnel over the course of 30 min. In the initial 7-10 min of the addition, the reaction mixture turns into a clear yellow solution. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 30 \u00b0C. When the temperature reaches 25 \u00b0C, the addition is paused to allow the temperature to decrease to around 15 \u00b0C. Residual solid on the spatula, the solid-addition funnel and the addition neck of the flask is washed into the reaction mixture with a portion of the reaction mixture (15 mL) and then MeCN (10 mL). The 500-mL pear-shaped flask used in Step A is also rinsed with a portion of the reaction mixture (20 mL) and then with MeCN (20 mL). The resultant yellow solutions are transferred into the reaction system. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min to completely consume the starting material (Note 7). Tap water (300 mL) is added to the flask using an addition funnel and a white precipitate forms. Half of the heterogeneous solution is transferred into a 1-L flask and MeCN is removed on a rotary evaporator (1 mmHg, 15 \u00b0C). The remaining half is transferred to the same 1-L flask and again the MeCN is removed on a rotary evaporator (1 mmHg, 15 \u00b0C). A large amount of white solid appears in the flask. The solid is collected by filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel (\u03a6 = 10 cm) and washed with tap water (100 mL) (Note 8). The white solid is transferred into a 1-L one-necked flask and dissolved in MeCN (300 mL), followed by an addition of tap water (150 mL). The resultant mixture is evaporated on a rotary evaporator (1 mmHg, 15 \u00b0C) to remove the MeCN and again a large amount of white solid appears. The solid is collected by filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel (\u03a6 = 10 cm) and washed with tap water (100 mL). The white solid is transferred into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, dissolved into CH2Cl2 (300 mL) (Note 3) and dried over Na2SO4 (40 g) (Note 3). The dried solution is filtered into a 1-L one-necked pear-shaped flask through a sintered funnel and washed with CH2Cl2 (150 mL). The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 55 \u00b0C) and the resulting white solid is dried for 2 h at 0.5 mmHg in a vacuum drying oven (40 \u00b0C) (Note 9 ). The desired product 2 is obtained as a white solid (39.4\u201340.9 g, 83\u201386%) (Note 10)."

A 500-mL, oven-dried three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4.5-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, is charged with L-proline (6.34 g, 55 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 14). One neck of the flask is fitted with an argon balloon, and a second neck is equipped with a thermometer for measuring the internal temperature. The flask is charged with dichloromethane (120 mL) and the third neck capped with a rubber septum (Note 14). Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (12.5 mL, 54.4 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added by means of a syringe in one portion (Note 15). The resulting suspension is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C using an ice-water bath. Triethylamine (27.0 mL, 194 mmol, 3.9 equiv) (Note 16) is added via a syringe over approximately 5 min. After completion of the addition, the ice-water bath is removed and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture becomes homogeneous as the proline reacts with Boc 2O to afford the intermediate N-Boc protected proline. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath. Ethyl chloroformate (5.0 mL, 53 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise over 5 min by means of a syringe. During the addition, a white precipitate of triethylammonium hydrochloride is formed. Upon completion of the addition, the resulting slurry is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for an additional 0.5 h. The crude solid 2 is then added in one portion via a solid addition funnel. Dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 14) is used to rinse the residue on the addition funnel into the reaction flask. After the addition is complete, the resulting milky suspension is stirred vigorously at 0 \u00b0C for 1 h and then allowed to warm to room temperature overnight (Note 17). The reaction mixture is then concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg) to dryness, providing the crude N-Boc proline amide 4 as a pale yellow solid. Dichloromethane (40 mL) and methanol (80 mL) are then added to the crude 4, followed by dropwise addition of 12 N HCl (20 mL, ca. 240 mmol) (Note 18). After the addition, the flask is placed in an oil bath (50-55 \u00b0C) and the resulting slurry is vigorously stirred for 5 h. During this time, the slurry becomes homogeneous after 1.5 h as 4 is converted to the 5 \u2022HCl salt. After the reaction is complete (Note 19), the resulting solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 70 mmHg) until most of MeOH is removed, and the residue solidifies. The resulting solid is suspended in H2O (100 mL) and EtOAc (200 mL) at 0-5 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath. The aqueous (lower) phase is adjusted to pH 8-9 with 6 M NaOH (35 mL). The ice-water bath is removed and the slurry is vigorously stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h. The resulting slurry of 5 (Note 20) is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel using EtOAc (150 mL) to aid the transfer. After separation of the organic layer, the aqueous phase is extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 1 M NaOH (50 mL), H2O (2 x 50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over MgSO4, and filtered to give a pale-yellow solution (Note 21). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg to 40 mmHg) (Note 22) and then further dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) at room temperature for 1-2 h, to give the crude product 5 as a white-pale yellow solid (14.9-18.0 g) (Note 23). The crude product is dissolved in EtOAc (11 mL per gram of crude 5) at reflux (Note 24), and the product is allowed to crystallize at room temperature overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 50 mL of ice-cold 5% EtOAc in hexane, and then air-dried to constant weight to provide the title compound 5 as a white crystalline solid (7.6-8.4 g, 42-46% based on 1) (Notes 25 and 26)."

After cooling to 23 \u00b0C, (R,R)-Taddol (2.0 g, 4.29 mmol) (Note 1) is added to the round-bottomed flask, a rubber septum is fitted, the reaction flask is put under an atmosphere of N2, and tetrahydrofuran (75 mL) (Note 2) is added via syringe. To this clear, colorless solution, triethylamine (2.4 mL, 17.2 mmol, 4 equiv) (Note 3) is added via syringe resulting in a clear solution with a slight yellow color. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice bath and phosphorous trichloride (0.39 mL, 4.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 2 min via syringe resulting in a white suspension. The ice bath is removed, the reaction is allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice bath, and pyrrolidine (1.8 mL, 21.4 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 5) is added via syringe. The ice bath is removed, the reaction is allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C and stir for 1 h. Diethyl ether (50 mL) is then added, and the reaction mixture is filtered through a medium-fritted funnel into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask. The solid residue in the reaction flask is washed with diethyl ether (2 x 25 mL) and the filtrates are added into the round-bottomed flask. The ether is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and washed with deionized water (50 mL) (Note 6). The organic layer is dried over MgSO4, vacuum-filtered through a 100 mL course-fritted filter funnel into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask using a water aspirator, and the MgSO4 is rinsed with diethyl ether (2 x 10 mL). The filtrate is concentrated in vacuo using a rotovap, and the off-white solid put under high vacuum for 30 min. An egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (12.7 x 25.4 mm) and EtOAc (5 mL) are added to the round-bottomed flask containing the solid and a reflux condenser is attached. Using an oil bath, the mixture is heated to reflux with stirring and EtOAc (~20 mL) is added dropwise until all of the solids dissolve. The stir bar is removed from the clear, slightly yellow solution. The round-bottomed flask is allowed to cool slowly in the oil bath to 23 \u00b0C, placed in a \u201310 \u00b0C fridge for 12 h, and then placed in a \u201324 \u00b0C freezer for 12 h.

After cooling to 23 \u00b0C, a rubber septum is fitted to the round-bottomed flask and the flask is put under an atmosphere of N 2. Dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 9) and 5-hexenoic acid (10.4 mL, 87.6 mmol) (Note 10) are added via syringe to the round-bottomed flask and the flask is cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice bath. 1,8-Diazabicylo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (14.2 mL, 94.6 mmol, 1.08 equiv) (Note 11) is added to the round-bottomed flask via syringe over 5 min and the clear solution is stirred for 20 min. Diphenyl phosphoryl azide (20.4 mL, 94.6 mmol, 1.08 equiv) (Note 12) is added over 5 min via syringe resulting in a clear, yellow solution. The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 h at 0 \u00b0C. The ice bath is removed, the septum is removed, and hexanes (200 mL) (Note 13) is added. The reaction is stirred for 5 min and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. After the layers separate, the lower, yellow dichloromethane layer is collected in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and the upper, cloudy hexane layer is transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The dichloromethane layer is returned to the separatory flask and the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed with hexanes (200 mL) and transferred to the separatory funnel. The dichloromethane layer is extracted with hexanes. The lower dichloromethane layer is collected in the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and the cloudy hexane layer is transferred to the 1-L round-bottomed flask, which (without a septum) is placed into a 23 \u00b0C oil bath that is heated to 50 \u00b0C for 3 h and then at 55 \u00b0C for 3 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the solvent is removed in vacuo using a 23 \u00b0C bath. This yellow solution is transferred to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask, and the 1 L flask is rinsed with minimal hexanes, which are transferred to the 25-mL round-bottomed flask. The 25-mL flask is concentrated in vacuo using a 23 \u00b0C bath (40 mmHg). The resultant yellow oil is purified via vacuum distillation and the first clear fraction distilling at 63 \u00b0C (50 mmHg) is collected in a 25 mL round-bottomed flask cooled to 0 \u00b0C. Pentenyl isocyanate (4.34 g, 45%) is isolated as a clear liquid (Notes 14 and 15).",

The flask is equipped with a 2-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar followed by addition of DMAP (0.183 g, 1.52 mmol, 0.10 equiv). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and flushed with argon. The mixture is diluted with dry CH2Cl2 (76.2 mL) (Note 10), followed by addition of Et3N (5.3 mL, 3.9 g, 38 mmol, 2.5 equiv) and acetic anhydride (3.6 mL, 3.9 g, 38 mmol, 2.5 equiv) using a 10 mL and 5 mL disposable syringe, respectively (Note 11). The reaction is stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then transferred to a 250\u2013mL separatory funnel. The mixture is diluted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and washed with 1M aqueous HCl (2 x 100 mL), H 2O (1 x 100 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2 x 100 mL) and H2O (1 x 100 mL). The combined aqueous layer is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 100 mL) (Note 12) and the combined organic layer dried over MgSO4 (14 g). The suspension is filtered by suction through cotton wool using a glass funnel into a 1-L round-bottomed flask using CH2Cl2 (200 mL) to transfer and wash the MgSO4. To the filtrate is added Celite (17 g) and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 550-27mmHg).

            "Methods for the preparation of donor-acceptor (push-pull) cyclopropanes for the purpose of incorporating a single carbon between two carbonyl groups have been developed by a number of research groups (Scheme 1). Bier\u00e4ugel described the cyclopropanation of a \u03b2-keto ester-derived enamine, which upon hydrolysis provided homologated material.2 Attempts by Saigo to mimic these results with silyl enol ethers were inefficient and provided mixtures of products when using zinc carbenoids, although reactions based on copper-carbenoids derived from diazoesters were more efficient.3 A radical-based method for homologation of \u03b2-dicarbonyls was reported by Dowd, although the one-carbon insertion was limited to \u03b1-substituted \u03b2-dicarbonyl starting materials.4 A complementary strategy for the formation of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes was reported by Reissig, in which methyl ketone-derived enol ethers were reacted with stabilized rhodium carbenoids.5 The resulting cyclopropanes could be converted cleanly to \u03b3-keto esters through hydrolysis and used as nucleophilic species in tandem reaction processes.\nA one-pot zinc carbenoid-mediated homologation reaction was reported by Zercher and co-workers.6 Treatment of unfunctionalized \u03b2-keto esters with the Furukaw\u03b1-modified Simmons-Smith reagent,7 generated from an equimolar ratio of diethylzinc and diiodomethane, provided rapid and efficient access to \u03b3-keto esters (Scheme 2). Labeling studies revealed that the carbenoid carbon was inserted regioselectively adjacent to the ketone functionality, an observation that suggested the intermediacy of a donor-accepter cyclopropane.\nMechanistic understanding of the zinc carbenoid-mediated homologation reaction was also informed by computational investigations, NMR analyses of reactive intermediates, and studies involving reaction stoichiometry.8 The proposed reaction mechanism is summarized in Scheme 3. After initial deprotonation by zinc carbenoid (or diethylzinc), the resulting enolate reacts with carbenoid to provide homoenolate 3. Intramolecular cyclization into the more electrophilic carbonyl provides the donor-acceptor cyclopropane (4), which fragments with a low energy barrier to provide an organometallic intermediate. This species is structurally reminiscent of the traditional zinc-Reformatsky intermediate,8 and the strong covalent character of the carbon zinc bond is likely responsible for the absence of its reactivity with the various alkylating electrophiles (carbenoid and ethyl iodine) present in solution.\nThe proposed mechanism illustrates that two equivalents of diethylzinc are necessary to effect the transformation, although in practice three equivalents of diethylzinc are used to ensure that the reactions proceed to completion. If acidic protons are present in the reaction substrate, the use of additional diethylzinc might be necessary and does not hinder the homologation reaction. Neat diethylzinc usually offers superior results, although commercial solutions of diethylzinc can be used to avoid the handling of the pyrophoric neat reagent. The replacement of diethylzinc with an alternate base for the purpose of enolate formation, thereby reducing the amount of pyrophoric reagent required in the reaction, should only be undertaken with the understanding that the stability of the zinc-organometallic intermediate 5 may be compromised in the presence of an alternate counterion. Reactions performed in the presence of non-zinc counterions result in greater product diversity and lower isolated yields of the simple homologated product.10\nThe zinc carbenoid-mediated transformation described herein offers a number of advantages to many of the other donor-acceptor cyclopropane methods. For instance, easily accessible and often commercially available \u03b2-keto carboxylic acid derivatives serve as starting materials with no need for derivatization as enol ethers or enamines. Furthermore, no hydrolysis step is necessary to fragment the cyclopropane, which means that protic quenching of the reactive intermediate can be delayed until after homologation is complete and tandem reactions are performed. The zinc carbenoid-mediated homologation reaction operates on a wide variety of \u03b2-keto carboxylic acid derivatives,11, 12and \u03b2-keto phosphonates13 can also be transformed into the \u03b3-keto homologues (Scheme 4).\n\u03b1-Substitution present on \u03b2-keto carboxylate starting materials often results in poor yields of chain extended or ring expanded products due to further reaction of the intermediate enolate; in contrast, \u03b1-substitution on \u03b2-keto phosphonate starting materials is well tolerated. Treatment of \u03b1-carboxyester cycloketones with carbenoid provides modest yields of the ring-expanded products, with use of more electrophilic carbenoids and control of stoichiometry being key to maximizing the efficiency of the transformation (Scheme 5).14\nSubstituted carbenoids provides the means to incorporate functionality at the \u03b2-position of the \u03b3-keto ester products. For example, the carbenoid prepared from 1,1-diiodoethane leads to regioselective incorporation of a methyl group adjacent to the ketone functionality (Scheme 6) while preserving enolate character developed adjacent to the ester.15\nThe utility of the zinc-carbenoid-mediated homologation reactions has been enhanced through its application to tandem reaction protocols. The zinc enolate, which is regioselectively incorporated adjacent to the ester functionality, can react with electrophiles to effect the tandem reactions. While most of the tandem sequences described below are applicable to the array of \u03b2-keto carboxylic acid derivatives, \u03b2-keto phosphonate substrates are often poor partners in the tandem reaction processes. While a variety of electrophiles can be used to effect tandem reactions, not all electrophiles react efficiently with the intermediate. For example, alkylation of the organometallic intermediate (enolate) is slow, which is consistent with its similarity to the traditional zinc-Reformatsky intermediate.8 Therefore, incorporation of alkyl substituents at the \u03b1-carbon of the homologated material must rely upon indirect methods, some of which are highlighted below. Fortunately, many electrophiles react efficiently with the organometallic intermediate to provide access to a diverse array of \u03b1-substituted \u03b3-keto esters.\nExposure of the organometallic intermediate 5 to aldehydes or ketones provide tandem aldol products.16 Use of ester or amide starting materials provides selective access to syn-aldol products with diastereocontrol as high as 20:1 (Scheme 7a). The syn selectivity is attributed to the influence of the \u03b3-keto functionality, which is believed to favor formation of an intermediate Z-enolate.17 Reaction through a closed transition state would then account for the syn-selectivity. Tandem homologation-aldol reactions on substrates that possess an Evans auxiliary result in formation of anti-aldol products with excellent enolate facial selectivity (Scheme 7b). The anti-selectivity is consistent with the stereochemistry observed when excess Lewis acid is used in the reaction of oxazolidinone-derived Z-enolates.18 Due to the use of three or more equivalents of diethylzinc in the homologation portion of the reaction, excess zinc(II) is likely responsible for the aldol reaction proceeding through an open transition state.\nThe products of tandem homologation aldol reactions exist in hemi-acetal forms, which are attractive precursors to substituted tetrahydrofuranyl systems. A tandem homologation-aldol reaction, which utilized a carbenoid-derived from 1,1-diiodoethane, provided rapid access to the trisubstituted ring system, which was eventually converted to a cis, cis-phaseolinic acid derivative via oxidative cleavage (Scheme 8). The presence of the methyl group adjacent to the enolate was responsible for controlling both enolate facial and the anti-aldol selectivities.19 The aldol products can also be oxidized to provide 1,4-diketones, which have been used as precursors for heterocycle formation.20\nThe organometallic intermediate can also be trapped with imine functionality, which provides a rapid route to substituted \u03b2-proline derivatives.21 While the yields are modest and the chiral sulfonamide-derived imines cannot be used due to carbenoid reactivity with the sulfur, diastereocontrol can be effected through selection of the nitrogen activating group. Deprotection and reduction of the cyclic imine completes the preparation of \u03b2-proline derivatives (Scheme 9). Enantiomerically-enriched products can be accessed through the use of oxazolidinone auxiliaries.\nThe stability of the intermediate organometallic species (5) generated from a \u03b2-keto ester is demonstrated through the absence of its reaction with excess carbenoid, even over an extended period of time; however, the addition of catalytic trimethylsilyl chloride to the organometallic intermediate induces reaction with carbenoid to effect formation of an intermediate ester homoenolate.22 Protonation completes the installation of a methyl group, while formation of an iodomethyl side chain through treatment with iodine23 provides access to a versatile functional group for further manipulation (Scheme 10). The use of the electrophilic carbenoid for carbon-carbon bond formation, therefore, provides a route to products unavailable from direct alkylation with alkyl halides.\nDirect treatment of the organometallic intermediate with iodine provides access to the isolable \u03b1-iodo-species,17 which can be efficiently transformed to an a,\u03b2-unsaturated-\u03b3-keto ester functionality by treatment with base.24 This transformation has been a key step in the synthesis of numerous natural products, including (+)-brefeldin A25 (Scheme 11) and patulolides A and B.26 In addition, carbon nucleophiles can be incorporated into these products via regioselective conjugate addition, which provides another indirect route to the incorporation of an alkyl group at the \u03b1-carbon.27\nExposure of the organometallic intermediate to anhydrides is effective for the production of \u03b1-acylated products. The products produced from tandem homologation-acylation reactions are \u03b2-keto esters, which are appropriate substrates for heterocycle formation through Paul-Knorr reactions.20 In addition, the acylated products are appropriate \u03b2-keto ester substrates for which a second homologation reaction would effect formation of double chain extended products. One example of a tandem chain extension-acylation reaction involves treatment of methyl acetoacetate with carbenoid, followed by addition of methoxymaleic anhydride, which generates an acylated product that spontaneously cyclizes to generate a spiroketal. Members of the papyracillic acid family of natural products were successfully prepared through the use of this strategy (Scheme 12).28\nThe reactions of \u03b2-diketones differ significantly from the reactions of \u03b2-keto esters, amides, or phosphonates. While the installation of the carbenoid carbon between the two ketone groups is believed to proceed through fragmentation of a donor-acceptor cyclopropane, the resulting intermediate is a reactive enolate as opposed to the stable organometallic formed from \u03b2-keto esters. The enolate reacts with additional equivalents of the carbenoid to form chain-extended cyclopropanol products (Scheme 13).6, 29 The absence of similar cyclopropanol products when starting with \u03b2-keto esters reflects the differences between zinc enolates of ketones and zinc enolates of carboxylic acid derivatives.\nStrongly electrophilic carboxylic acid derivatives, such as acylated oxazolidinones, also provide access to cyclopropanated products when exposed to carbenoid for extended reaction times.12, 23"

To a clean and dry 3-L four-necked flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer and a PTFE-coated temperature probe, furfuryl alcohol (1) (140 g, 1.40 moles, 1.05 equiv) and 1.2 L of dichloromethane are added using medium stirring rate under ambient atmosphere (Note 1). The third neck of the flask is fitted with an inlet adapter with a piece of tubing attached to a bubbler. The fourth neck is sealed with a glass stopper. The flask is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C, then charged with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (315 g, 1.36 moles, actual potency 74.7 w%) in five equal portions through the fourth neck, maintaining the internal temperature between 0 and 10 \u00b0C (Note 2). Once the addition of oxidant is complete, the heterogeneous mixture is warmed to room temperature by removing the ice bath and stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h (Notes 3 and 4). The reaction is subsequently cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C, and the reaction by-product, solid meta-chlorobenzoic acid is removed by filtration using a 150 mm B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper. The solids are washed with pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) dichloromethane (250 mL) (Note 5). The combined filtrate is transferred to a 2 L flask, and one-half of the dichloromethane is removed under reduced pressure (250-350 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 30 \u00b0C bath temperature. Isopropyl alcohol (450 mL) is added to this solution and the distillation is continued, using vacuum as low as 30 mmHg, until the volume of the solution reached 300 mL (Note 6). After verifying the final volume with a graduated cylinder, the solution is transferred back to the clean 3-L round-bottomed flask. Using an addition funnel heptane (300 mL) is added over 15 min under moderate agitation (Note 7). Once the product crystals appear, the solution is stirred for 30 min, followed by addition of heptane (600 mL) over 15 min. The slurry is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C, aged for 1 h, and then placed in a 0-5 \u00b0C refrigerator overnight (Note 8).\nThe cold slurry is filtered using a 125 mm B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper, and the solids are subsequently washed with pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) 3:1 heptane:isopropyl alcohol mixture (150 mL), followed by heptane (150 mL).

The third neck of the flask is fitted with an inlet adapter with a piece of tubing attached to a bubbler. The fourth neck is sealed with a glass stopper. The light yellow slurry is heated gently to 20 \u00b0C until all lactol dissolves. To this solution is added powdered benzoic anhydride (243 g, 1.05 moles, 1.2 equiv) in one portion, followed by the addition of powdered 4-dimethylaminopyridine (3.3 g, 26.3 mmoles, 0.03 equiv) in one portion (Note 11), through the fourth neck. After addition of the solid reagents, an orange homogeneous solution appears within 15 min, and agitation is continued for 1 h (Note 12). The temperature is maintained between 20-23 \u00b0C through the use of a water bath over that time period. Solids begin to precipitate after about 45 min of stirring to form a slurry within 2-3 min. The flask is subsequently cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C, which results in a thick white slurry (Note 13). To this slurry is added water (100 mL) in one portion and the suspension is held at 0-5 \u00b0C for 1 h (Note 14). The cold slurry is transferred to a 150 mm B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper, and filtered by applying house vacuum (~100 mmHg).

At this point, any remaining red insolubles not dissolved at this temperature are removed by filtration using a 125 mm B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper, which provides a clear orange solution (Note 16). To a 3-L four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, a 250 mL addition funnel and a PTFE-coated temperature probe, is added lipase from Candida rugosa (Lipase MY) (12.5 g, 10 weight%, actual activity 30,000 u/g). The fourth neck is sealed with a glass stopper. The filtered organic layer that contains 3 is added in one portion using rapid stirring under ambient atmosphere (Note 17). The heterogeneous thin suspension is heated carefully to an internal temperature of 40 \u00b0C using a heating mantle. The heating is controlled such that the internal temperature of 40 \u00b0C is not exceeded. In a separate flask, water (6.25 g) in n-butanol (125 mL) is prepared, and this solution is added dropwise to the reaction flask via the 250 mL addition funnel over 30 min (Note 18). The suspension is agitated for 6.5 h at 40 \u00b0C, and then is immediately filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper (Notes 19 and 20). The clear orange filtrate is added to a separatory funnel and then washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (600 mL), followed by water (600 mL). The organic layer is stirred for 20 min with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The suspension is filtered to remove the sodium sulfate and the solution stored in a flask in the refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) overnight. The organic layer is concentrated to 250 mL under reduced pressure (<100 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 50 \u00b0C bath temperature. Upon reaching the desired volume, tert-amyl alcohol (500 mL) is added to the flask, and the total volume is reduced under vacuum to 250 mL. The resulting warm solution is transferred to a 500 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirbar and fitted with a thermocouple in one neck and a 250 mL addition funnel in the other. The solution is allowed to cool by stirring at ambient temperature, and crystals begins to precipitate at about 40 \u00b0C internal temperature. Once the internal temperature reaches about 30 \u00b0C, heptane (125 mL) is added. The suspension is then stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h, cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath and stirred for 1 h. The cold slurry is filtered on a 125 mm B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with a Whatman grade 1 filter paper using house vacuum, and the cake is subsequently washed with 1:1 tert-amyl alcohol/n-heptane (125 mL) followed by heptane (125 mL) (Note 21).

            "A. (S)-1-(Furan-2-yl)ethanol (2). To a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a 5 cm octagonal magnetic stir bar is added sodium formate (55.0 g, 0.801 mol) (Note 1) followed by 267 mL of deionized water to make a 3.0 M solution. The solution is stirred until all of the solid dissolves and simultaneously degassed by bubbling nitrogen gas through the solution via a needle for 5 min at room temperature. Liquid 2-acetyl furan (1) (16.4 mL, 18.1 g, 0.163 mol, 1 equiv) (Note 2), CH2Cl2 (2 mL) (Note 3), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (5.9 g, 10 mol%) (Note 4) are added, the flask loosely capped with a polyethylene cap, and the solution stirred for 20 min. To the resulting brown suspension, Noyori asymmetric transfer hydrogenation catalyst (R)-Ru(\u03b76-mesitylene)-(S,S)-TsDPEN (304 mg, 0.3 mol%) (Note 5) is added, and the Erlenmeyer flask again capped loosely with a polyethylene stopper. The resulting suspension is stirred vigorously at room temperature for 24 h (Note 6). The progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC using p-anisaldehyde as stain (Compound 2 has an Rf=0.26 in 20% EtOAc in hexanes. The starting 2-acetyl furan (Rf=0.37) is UV active, whereas the product alcohol is not) (Note 7). The darker brown reaction mixture is diluted with water (200 mL), the magnetic stir bar removed, and the solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The mixture is extracted with Et2O (4 x 500 mL) and the layers are allowed to separate over a period of 30 min for each extraction (Note 8). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (150 mL) (Note 9), saturated NaCl solution (150 mL), dried over Na2SO4 (22.5 g) (Note 10), and passed through a small plug of silica gel (50 g SiO2, vacuum filtration, 6.5 cm in diameter, 3.2 cm height, 0.5 cm sand). The Na2SO4 is washed with Et2O (2 x 150 mL) and successively passed through the silica gel plug. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (20 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg initial to 25 mmHg) yielding 16.7 g of the crude furan alcohol (2) as a dark grey oil (Note 11). A small amount of the representative sample is purified using silica gel flash chromatography eluting with 20-25% Et2O/hexanes to give pure furan alcohol 2 as a colorless oil (Note 12).",
            "B. (2S, 6R)-6-Hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one (3). The crude furan alcohol (2) (16.57 g, 0.148 mol, 1.0 equiv) in a 500 mL 2-neck Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a thermometer and 5 cm magnetic stir bar (Note 13) is dissolved in 248 mL of THF/H2O (3:1) (Note 14) and cooled to 1.2 \u00baC using an ice-water bath. Solid NaHCO3 (24.85 g, 0.296 mol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 9) and NaOAc\u20223H2O (20.2 g, 0.148 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 15) are added successively over the course of 1 min each, during which time the temperature lowers to \u20131.2 \u00baC. After stirring for 5 min, solid N-bromosuccinimide (27.97 g, 0.156 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 16) is added to the solution portion-wise (approx. 7 g every 5 min). The resulting orange/red color resulting from each addition of NBS quickly subsides to a green/brown suspension and the temperature is maintained between 1 \u00baC and 10 \u00baC. Upon the last addition of NBS, the orange/red color persists through the remainder of the reaction. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 2 h and the temperature maintained between 1\u20132 \u00baC. Product formation is monitored by TLC (Note 7) using p -anisaldehyde as stain (Compound 3 possesses an Rf=0.24 in 40% EtOAc in hexanes, while the starting material\u2019s Rf=0.52). The resulting slurry is diluted with Et2O (100 mL) and transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel containing H2O (200 mL) and an additional Et2O (100 mL) that were precooled to 4.5 \u00baC in an ice/water bath. The organic layer is separated. The bottom aqueous layer, which still contains some solid material, is once again washed with Et2O (3 x 400 mL) and the combined organics are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (200 mL), after which the red/orange organic phase changes to a grey/faint red solution. The organic layer is then dried over sodium sulfate (30 g) (Note 10) with stirring for 30 min to give a clear grey organic phase. The sodium sulfate is filtered, washed with Et2O (2 x 50 mL), and the combined filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator (20\u00b0C, 150 mmHg initial to 25 mmHg final) yielding a crude mixture of alcohol diastereomers 3 as a grey/faint red oil (24.33 g) (Note 17), which is stored in a freezer at \u201319 \u00baC. A small amount of the representative crude sample is purified by silica gel flash chromatography, eluting with 25-30% EtOAc/hexanes, to give a mixture of diastereomers 3 as a colorless oil (Note 18).",
            "C. tert-Butyl ((2S,6S)-6-methyl-5-oxo-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-yl) carbonate (4) and tert-butyl ((2R,6S)-6-methyl-5-oxo-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-yl) carbonate (5). An oven-dried, 500 mL 3-necked, round-bottomed flask with 3.5 cm octagonal stirbar is equipped on the left neck with a nitrogen inlet adapter, the middle neck a rubber septum, and the right neck a rubber thermometer adapter with thermometer (Note 19). The crude mixture of diastereomeric allylic alcohols (3) (24.2 g, 0.148 mol, 1 equiv) (Note 20) is added and dissolved in anhydrous DCM (185 mL) (Note 3). The solution is cooled to \u201367.2 \u00b0C (using a dry ice\u2013acetone bath) under nitrogen atmosphere, the center septum removed, and solid (Boc)2O (74.25 g, 0.273 mol, 2.3 equiv) (Note 21) added via funnel over the course of one min so as to maintain stirring. A catalytic amount of DMAP (1.82 g, 14.8 \u03bcmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 22) is then added. The resulting solution is allowed to stir for 6 h at \u201366.8 \u00baC and then warmed to 2.2 \u00baC in an ice-water bath and stirred for a 3 h period (Note 23). The ice-water bath is then removed and the reaction stirred for 1 h, during which time the reaction warms to 7.2 \u00baC. The reaction is monitored by TLC using potassium permanganate as stain (Compounds 4 and 5 possess Rf=0.48 and 0.44, respectively, in 20% EtOAc in hexanes, while the starting material\u2019s R f=0.11). The reaction mixture is then brought to 2.4 \u00baC (ice-water bath), diluted with Et2O (100 mL), and quenched by the addition of saturated NaHCO3 (150 mL) (Note 3) over the course of 1 min. The mixture is extracted with Et2O (4 x 500 mL) using 2-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed sequentially with 1N solution of NaHSO4 (to remove excess DMAP) (Note 24), saturated NaHCO3(150 mL), and saturated aqueous NaCl (150 mL), after which the solution is dried over sodium sulfate (15.0 g) and filtered. The sodium sulfate is rinsed with Et2O (2 x 50 mL) and the combined filtrate is transferred into a 3-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator (20 \u00baC, 150 mmHg initially to 25 mmHg), which yields a crude mixture of Boc-protected pyranones as a red-brown oil.\nThe crude product is purified by SiO2 flash chromatography using a solvent gradient of Et2O in hexane (0.5% to 10% Et2O in hexane v/v). The diameter of the chromatography column is 9.0 cm, and the column is packed using silica gel (500 g) (Note 7) to a height of 14.5 cm and wetted with 0.5% Et2O/hexanes. The oil is loaded to the top of the column and absorbed on to the silica. After placing a 0.5 cm layer of sand on top of silica, 500 mL of 0.5% Et2O/hexanes is passed through the column. After the initial solvent is collected additional amounts of eluent are added to the top of the column with slight incremental increases in solvent polarity (e.g., 500 mL of 1% Et2O/hexanes, followed by 500 mL of 2% Et2O/hexane, until 500 mL of 10% Et2O/hexanes has been passed through the column. An additional 2.5 L of 10% Et2O/hexanes is then passed through the column). The first 4-L of solvent is collected in 500 mL fractions in Erlenmeyer flasks, after which the eluent is collected in 200 mL fractions. Fractions are monitored by TLC for product (using potassium permanganate as stain) (Note 13). The \u03b1-L-Boc-pyranone 4 elutes off of the column with the 8-10% Et2O/hexanes wash. The fractions containing the pure \u03b1-L-Boc-pyranone 4 (least polar diastereomer, Rf (20% EtOAc/hexanes) = 0.59) are collected, concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 \u00baC, 150 mmHg initially to 25 mmHg), and placed under high vacuum (1.5 mmHg)), to yield 13.02 g (57.0 mmol) of a faint yellow solid. Fractions containing a mixture of diastereomers (obtained during the 10% Et2O/hexanes solvent system) are also collected to yield 0.50 g of a colorless oil, which can be separated by further chromatography. The \u03b2-L-Boc-pyranone 5 elutes off of the column with the later 10% Et2O/hexanes wash. Fractions containing the pure \u03b2-L-Boc-pyranone 5 (more polar diastereomer, Rf (20% EtOAc/hexanes) = 0.50) (Note 13) are collected, concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 \u00baC, 150 mmHg initially to 25 mmHg), and placed under high vacuum (1.5 mmHg) to yield 5.23 g (22.9 mmol) of a faint yellow solid (Note 25). The Boc-protected pyranones are stored in a freezer. The overall yield for the three steps is 51% (Note 26)."

The glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum fitted with a thermocouple temperature probe, and Et2O (40 mL) (Note 3) is added through the addition funnel. The mixture is heated at reflux (preheated oil bath, temperature 50 \u00b0C) for 10 min (Note 4) and then allowed to cool to room temperature by removing the oil bath. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of propargyl bromide (25.1 g, 211 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 5) in 80 mL of Et2O (Note 6). The propargyl bromide solution is cautiously added dropwise to the reaction flask (Note 7) over 1.5 h at a rate that maintains the reaction mixture at gentle reflux (see photo) (Note 8).\nThe dark brown reaction mixture is next heated at reflux in an oil bath for an additional hour and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Stirring is halted to allow the excess aluminum powder to settle and the brown supernatant solution is transferred via cannula to a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 30 x 15 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet adapter (see photo). The solids in the original flask are rinsed with two 100-mL portions of Et2O, which are transferred via cannula to the 1-L flask. The cannula is then removed from the rubber septum and replaced with a thermocouple temperature probe.\nThe dark green-brown solution (Note 9) is cooled to -73 \u00b0C (internal temperature) using an acetone/dry ice bath, and a solution of trimethyl orthoformate (HC(OMe)3) (17.9 mL, 17.2 g, 162 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 10) in 30 mL of Et2O is added via the addition funnel over 50 min while the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below -65 \u00b0C. The addition funnel is rinsed with 5 mL of Et2O. The resulting gray suspension is stirred at -73 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 15 min and 160 mL of deionized water is then added via the addition funnel over 45 min (Note 11). The acetone/dry ice bath is replaced by a room temperature water bath and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 20 \u00b0C over 30 min.\nThe contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with Et2O (4 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 5 M aqueous NaOH solution (140 mL), deionized water (2 x 100 mL), and saturated NaCl solution (100 mL), dried over 20 g of K2CO3, and filtered through filter paper into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 30 x 15 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar. The solution is concentrated to a volume of approximately 40 mL by distillation at 34-35 \u00b0C through a distillation head with a 10-cm condenser side arm. The resulting yellow solution is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a 13 x 8 mm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and equipped with a Perkin triangle. Distillation of the residual solvents is carried out at 20 \u00b0C, 300 mmHg and subsequently the pressure is reduced to 75 mmHg and the mixture heated in a 90 \u00b0C oil bath. A forerun of ca. 4 mL (bp 20-62 \u00b0C, 75 mmHg) and a main fraction containing the desired product of ca. 15 mL (bp 62-67 \u00b0C, 75 mmHg) are collected (see photo).\nThe distillation head is rinsed with 5 mL of pentane and the washings are combined with the forerun. The resulting solution and the residue in the original distillation flask (ca. 4 mL) are combined, transferred to a 25-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a 13 x 8 mm, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and equipped with a Perkin triangle, and distilled at 75 mmHg. After the volatile solvents have evaporated, a forerun of ca. 1 mL (bp 20-62 \u00b0C, 75 mmHg) and a main fraction containing the desired product of ca. 1 mL (bp 62-67 \u00b0C, 75 mmHg) are collected. The main fractions from each distillation are combined to provide a total yield of 14.3-14.6 g of 4,4-dimethoxybut-1-yne (1) (77-79%) as a colorless liquid (Note 12)."

A flame-dried 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 5-cm Teflon-coated egg-shaped magnetic stir bar and moved into a glovebox. The flask is charged with crystalline (lIpc)2BH (1) (13.5 g, 47.06 mmol, 1.18 equiv) (Note 1), and capped with rubber septa. The flask is then removed from the glovebox, equipped with an argon line and a thermometer (Note 2), and charged with diethyl ether (190 mL) (Note 3). The resulting white suspension is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (Note 4) with an ice/water bath and stirred for 15 min. 4-Acryloylmorpholine (2) (Note 3) (6.5 mL, 7.31 g, 51.76 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added over 5 min using a syringe pump. Upon complete addition, the mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h.\nAfter 15 min the white suspension becomes a clear solution, which gradually gives way to a turbid white suspension (Note 4). The ice/water bath is then replaced with a dry ice/acetone bath and the mixture is cooled to -78 \u00b0C and stirred for 15 min at this temperature. Hydrocinnamaldehyde (3) (Note 3) (5.3 mL, 5.37 g, 40.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added over 5 min using a syringe pump (Note 5).

The mixture is then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel with the aid of diethyl ether. The organic layer is removed and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are washed with two 100-mL portions of deionized water, one 100-mL portion of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) (100 g).\nThe drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration through a 150-mL fritted glass funnel and washed with three 25-mL portions of diethyl ether. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C bath temperature, 460 mmHg initial pressure to 10 mmHg final pressure) to afford 25.0-25.1 g of a clear yellow oil. For purification, the crude product is solubilized in 10-mL of 30% EtOAc-hexanes (70:30 hexanes:EtOAc) (Note 6) and loaded onto a 7.5 cm diameter column containing 200 g of silica gel that is prepacked with 30% EtOAc-hexanes (70:30 hexanes:EtOAc) (Note 7).

An argon line is inserted through one of the septa and the other one is replaced with a thermometer (Note 2). The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (THF) (80 mL) and borane-methyl sulfide complex (Note 3) (8.2 mL, 6.5 g, 80.1 mmol, 1.75 equiv) is added via syringe.

The reaction flask is tightly fitted with a rubber septum (as shown in the image below). Into the septum is placed an 18G x 1\u00bd\" needle attached to a modified 1 mL syringe. (The plunger is removed, and the end opposite from the needle juncture is cut off using scissors). The severed end of the syringe is attached to thick-walled rubber tubing (25 cm length), which is connected to a three-way valve. The second connection of the valve is attached by rubber tubing to a high vacuum line and the third to a balloon filled with O2. The reaction flask is evacuated briefly (Note 10) under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) and charged with O2; this process is repeated three times and then the flask is charged with O2 for a minute. The needle attached to the rubber septum is removed. The reaction mixture is stirred (Note 11) at room temperature for 5 min, during which time it is yellow to orange in color.\nThe reaction flask is placed in an oil bath and then heated to 90 \u00b0C and stirred for 4 h (Note 12). While heating, a blast shield is placed in front of the reaction set-up as a safety precaution. During the course of the reaction, the solution becomes green/yellow to dark brown in color. The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature and then placed in an ice bath for 5 min. The stopper is then removed, and 2.0 N aqueous HCl solution (50 mL) is added dropwise over 20 min with vigorous stirring (Note 13). The mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel and extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL) (Notes 14 and 15). The organic layers are combined in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 16) is added. The solution is allowed to stand for 5 min. Sodium sulfate is removed using a B\u00fcchner filter funnel, and the filtrate is concentrated in vacuo (30 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to obtain the crude product as a viscous red/brown oil (Note 17). The resulting residue is purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (Notes 18 and 19) using 66:33:1 hexanes:EtOAc:HOAc as the eluent, giving product 3a as an off-white solid (5.17 g, 82%) (Notes 20 and 21).

Meanwhile, a 100-mL round-bottomed flask containing a 2.5-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar is charged with tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (950 mg, 1.04 mmol, 0.025 equiv) (Note 18) and 2-(diisopropylphosphanyl)-1-phenylpyrrole (2) (538 mg, 2.07 mmol, 0.05 equiv), closed with a rubber septum, connected to a combined nitrogen/vacuum line and evacuated/back-filled with nitrogen twice. Toluene (60 mL) (Note 19) is added by syringe , and the solution is stirred (200 rpm) for 20 min at 20 \u00b0C. The resulting catalyst solution is added to the above piperidinylzinc reagent via syringe, and the 100 mL flask is washed with toluene (35 mL) (Note 19), before addition of 3-bromoanisole (3.65 mL, 29.1 mmol, 0.7 equiv) (Note 20).

The bi-phasic solution is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 75 mL) (Note 22). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (150 mL) (Note 8), dried over magnesium sulfate (10 g) (Note 9), filtered through a 150-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, which is washed with ethyl acetate (25 mL) (Note 22). The resulting solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to afford 22.4 g of an orange oil containing a precipitate (Note 23). This crude mixture is dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) (Note 24), charged with silica gel (30 g) (Note 25) then concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg), followed by 10 min under 0.05 mmHg at 20 \u00b0C.

The second fraction containing the desired product (4.13-4.21 g) is obtained in fractions 51-80, which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 5 mmHg). The first fraction is dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and silica gel (6 g) is added before being concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg), followed by 10 min under 0.05 mmHg at 20 \u00b0C.

After cooling to rt, hexane (100 mL) is added. The resultant two-phase mixture becomes one-phase after vigorous stirring. To remove the succinimide byproduct, the resulting mixture is filtered through a short plug of silica gel (50 g) eluting with 1400 mL of 1:1 dichloromethane-hexane, until TLC analysis shows that the product 2 is no longer detected in the eluent (Note 7). The filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg) (Note 8), and the resulting crude oil is purified by flash silica-gel column chromatography, eluting with hexane-dichloromethane (3:2) (Note 9).

            "A. Diethyl benzylphosphoramidate(1). A 250-mL, two-necked, heart-shaped flask (Note 1) equipped with a 32 x 16 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, a Liebig condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter, and a glass stopper is charged sequentially via syringe with benzylamine (3.19 mL, 3.13 g, 29.3 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2), 50 mL of diethyl ether (Note 3), and diethyl phosphite (1.91 mL, 2.06 g, 14.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv). Iodoform (5.76 g, 14.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added to the reaction mixture in three equal portions by temporarily removing the glass stopper. A vigorous bubbling starts after the first addition. Before the bubbling completely settles, the next portion of iodoform is added in order to maintain the momentum of the reaction. The portions are added approximately within 1 minute. The initiation of the reaction is indicated by an increase in temperature and spontaneous reflux of the solvent that begins a few seconds after the addition of iodoform (Note 5). During the course of the reaction the color of the heterogeneous reaction mixture changes from light yellow to white (see photos below).\nAfter 2.5 h, TLC analysis indicates the complete disappearance of diethyl phosphite (Note 6). The reaction mixture is then poured into a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask. The original two-necked flask is rinsed with 50 mL of CH2Cl2, which is added to the round-bottmed flask, and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 10.7 g of a thick light yellow suspension. This material is diluted with 40 mL of chloroform (Note 7), and the homogeneous solution is transferred to a 125-mL separatory funnel and washed with water (2 x 30 mL), 0.5% aqueous acetic acid (2 x 30 mL), water (2 x 50 mL), and saturated NaCl solution (1 x 50 mL). The light peach-colored organic layer is dried over 4 g of MgSO4 and filtered through a 30-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (medium porosity, 30 mm diameter). The MgSO4 is washed with chloroform (3 x 10 mL) and the combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 6.3 g of a light yellow oil.\nThis material is dissolved in a minimum amount of 5:1 EtOAc-CH2Cl2 (ca. 8 mL) and loaded onto a column (75 mm diameter) of 160 g of silica gel (Note 8) prepared as a slurry in 5:1 EtOAc-CH2Cl2. Elution with 5:1 EtOAc-CH2Cl2 (30 mL fractions collected in test tubes) affords the product in fractions 18-130. These fractions are combined and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at 20 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg over 16 h provides 3.18 g (89%) of phosphoramidate 1 as a viscous light yellow oil (Notes 9 and 10).",
            "B. 1-Bromooct-1-yne (2). A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1) equipped with a 32 x 16 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, rubber septum, and nitrogen inlet needle is charged with 1-octyne (2.90 mL, 2.17 g, 19.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 11) and 65 mL of acetone (Note 12). N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) (3.86 g, 21.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 13) is then added in one portion by temporarily removing the septum. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 min to allow all of the NBS to dissolve. Silver(I) nitrate (0.335 g, 1.97 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 14) is added in one portion by temporarily removing the septum, the flask is wrapped with aluminum foil, and the colorless suspension is stirred at room temperature for 3 h at which point TLC analysis shows complete consumption of octyne (Note 15).\nThe resulting white suspension is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and diluted with 65 mL of cooled deionized water (4 \u00b0C) and 70 mL of pentane. The organic phase is separated and washed with a saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 solution (3 x 25 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over 5 g of MgSO4, and filtered through a 150-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (fine porosity, 60 mm diameter). The MgSO4 is washed with pentane (3 x 30 mL) and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to yield 3.41-3.58 g (92-96%) of 2 as a light yellow oil, which is used in the next step without further purification (Notes 16 and 17).",

A 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1) equipped with a 20 x 9 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, rubber septum, and nitrogen inlet needle is charged with diethyl benzylphosphoramidate (1) (2.70 g, 11.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (0.416 g, 1.67 mmol, 0.15 equiv) (Note 18), 1,10-phenanthroline (0.600 g, 3.33 mmol, 0.30 equiv), and potassium phosphate (4.71 g, 22.2 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 19). The flask is evacuated to 0.5 mmHg and then backfilled with nitrogen (repeated two more times), and then 5 mL of toluene (Note 20) is added. A separate 50-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 1-bromooct-1-yne (2) (2.73 g, 14.4 mmol, 1.3 equiv) and fitted with a rubber septum and nitrogen inlet needle. Toluene (20 mL) is added and the solution of bromoalkyne is rapidly transferred into the 100-mL flask via a metal cannula and nitrogen pressure. The 50-mL flask is rinsed with two 1.5-mL portions of toluene. The reaction mixture is placed under reduced pressure via the vacuum manifold until bubbling ensues and then backfilled with argon; this is performed four times. The rubber septum is replaced with an 11-cm Liebig condenser fitted with a rubber septum and nitrogen inlet needle. The system is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen twice after which the heterogeneous brown reaction mixture (see photo) is heated in a 95 \u00b0C oil bath for 24 h (750 rpm stirring) (Note 21) at which point TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of phosphoramidate 1 (Note 22).\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered through 5 g of Celite in a 30-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (medium porosity, 30 mm diameter). The Celite is washed with 150 mL of EtOAc and the filtrate is concentrated to afford ca. 9 to 10 g of an orange oil. This material is dissolved in a minimum amount of CH2Cl2 (ca. 15 mL) and loaded onto a column (75 mm diameter) of 200 g of silica gel prepared as a slurry in 10:5:85 EtOAc-Et3N-hexanes. Elution with 10:5:85 EtOAc-Et3N-hexanes (30 mL fractions) affords the product in fractions 26-80. These fractions are combined, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at 20 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg over 16 h provides 3.16-3.27 g (81-84%) of ynamide 3 as a viscous yellow oil (Note 22)."

The glass stopper is removed under positive pressure of argon, and the flask is charged with (1S,2S)-(-)-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediamine (DPEN) (Note 1) (1.06 g, 5.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv), triethylamine (Note 2) (1.30 mL, 10.00 mmol, 2.00 equiv) and dichloromethane (Note 3) (40 mL), after which point the glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum pierced with a thermometer. The resulting solution is cooled to 1 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with an ice bath. A solution of 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonyl chloride (Note 4) (1.22 g, 5.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dichloromethane (20 mL) is added dropwise from the dropping funnel over 30 min into the reaction mixture, reaching a maximum internal temperature of 3 \u00b0C. After the completion of addition, the resulting mixture is warmed to room temperature (20 \u00b0C) and stirred for additional 6 h, at which point the reaction is white and heterogeneous. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 125-mL separatory funnel, washed with water (20 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (Note 5) solution (20 mL), and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 6) (10 g) for 30 min. After filtration through a medium-porosity fritted funnel, the organic solvent is removed under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg) by rotary evaporation to give a white solid (1.90-1.99 g). The resulting crude product is dissolved in ethyl acetate (Note 7) (22 mL) under refluxing conditions, and then petroleum ether (Note 8) (6 mL) is added dropwise until the solution becomes slightly turbid.

A solution of trifluoroacetic acid (Note 19) (0.797 g, 6.99 mmol, 0.10 equiv) in undegassed methanol (Note 20) (7 mL) is added to the tube under air atmosphere. The glass tube is then placed into a stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave is closed and connected to a hydrogen source from a cylinder (Note 21). After the autoclave is purged with hydrogen three times via pressurization and depressurization, the autoclave is pressurized with 50 atm of hydrogen (Note 22). The mixture is stirred at 18 \u00b0C (room temperature) for 15 h. During this period of time, the hydrogen pressure is kept at 50 atm by occasional introduction of hydrogen from the cylinder. When the consumption of hydrogen ceases, the gas-inlet tube is disconnected. After the excess hydrogen gas is carefully released by opening the valve, the autoclave is opened. The reddish reaction mixture is transferred into a 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask and diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (Note 23) solution (30 mL).

Molecular sieves (Note 1) are activated (Note 2) and 18 g are transferred to a 250-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas adaptor with stopcock. The flask is filled with argon, charged with Boc-L-proline (4.0 g, 18.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3), a magnetic stir bar (Note 4), and ZrCl4 (0.432 g, 1.86 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 5). Once the addition is complete, the adaptor is replaced with an oven-dried condenser fitted with a rubber septum, and the atmosphere is evacuated and replaced with argon (Note 6). Dry THF (93 mL) (Note 7) is added through the septum of the condenser with a syringe equipped with a long needle and the reaction mixture is then heated to reflux in an oil bath under vigorous stirring (Figure 1). At reflux, benzylamine (2.44 mL, 22.3 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 8) is added over a period of five minutes into the reaction mixture through the septum using a syringe equipped with a long needle. The rubber septum is replaced with an adaptor connected to an argon line. The mixture is refluxed for 48 h, allowed to cool to room temperature, and filtered through a pad of silica in a sintered glass filter funnel (Note 9), directly into a round-bottomed flask (250 mL) with the aid of water suction (ca. 300 mmHg). The original round-bottomed flask is washed three times with a total of 500 mL EtOAc:Et3N (200:1), which is subsequently filtered through the silica pad. The solvent is concentrated under reduced pressure (18 mmHg, 35 \u00b0C) and the resulting white solid is dissolved in 100 mL EtOAc and washed with 150 mL saturated aqueous NaCl. The aqueous layer is then extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The organic layer is combined and dried over MgSO4. The solvent is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting white solid is dissolved in a minimal amount (~ 40 mL) of hot (56 \u00b0C) acetone (Note 10), and then allowed to cool to room temperature. A minimal amount (~ 35 mL) of water is added until tiny precipitates begin to appear. The flask is left to stand in a refrigerator at -4 \u00b0C for 24 h. The precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration and the filtrate is transferred to another flask. The filtered material is washed with 100 mL deionized water. A portion of the water washings (~ 50 mL) is added to the original filtrate until tiny precipitates begin to appear. The flask is left to stand in a refrigerator for 48 h at -4 \u00b0C and the resulting precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration. The combined white solid is dried on a rotary evaporator in a water bath at 65 \u00b0C, and then under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) connected to a manifold for 6 h to yield the title compound (2) (3.78 g, 67%) (Note 11) as a white solid (Note 12)."

A 475 mL Parr vessel containing a cylindrical Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm in length, 1 cm in diameter) is charged with p-tolylamine (4.01 g, 37.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 1), 5-bromo-pyrimidine (7.34 g, 44.8 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 2), palladium acetate (257 mg, 1.23 mmol, 0.03 equiv) (Note 3), and ligand 1 (970 mg, 2.25 mmol, 0.06 equiv) in open air (Note 4). Acetonitrile (80.0 mL) (Note 5) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (26.1 mL, 149 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 6) are added to the vessel.\nThe vessel is sealed and purged with carbon monoxide three times. The vessel is then pressurized with carbon monoxide to 100 psi, and placed in a room-temperature oil bath. The oil bath is heated to 100 \u00b0C. The reaction is stirred at 100 \u00b0C (bath temperature) and 100 psi CO for 4 h (Notes 7 and 8). The reaction vessel is removed from the oil bath and cooled to ambient temperature while stirring. After releasing the pressure, HPLC analysis shows that p-tolylamine is fully consumed. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 250 mL one-necked round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Note 9) to fully remove acetonitrile and the tertiary amine. To the resulting dark semi-solid is added 2-MeTHF (100 mL) (Note 10) and 1 M aqueous NaOH (50 mL), and the resulting dark mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 h (Note 11). The two-phase mixture is then filtered through a pad of Celite (1 cm) in a 150 mL fritted funnel (medium porosity, Note 12) into a one-necked 500 mL round-bottomed flask using house vacuum. The Celite pad is washed with 2-MeTHF (2 x 100 mL). The combined filtrates are transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 15 min. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The upper organic layer is washed with water (2 x 100 mL) and then transferred to a one-necked 500 mL round-bottomed flask (Note 13). Dry silica gel (16 g) is added to the flask, and the resultant mixture is dried on a rotary evaporator until a brown powder is obtained (Note 14). This material is then placed atop a silica gel column (250 g, 8 cm diameter) that had been conditioned with 450 mL 20% EtOAc/hexanes. Sand is added on top of the silica gel. The column is eluted first with 1300 mL 20% EtOAc/hexanes to remove non-polar impurities. Pure EtOAc is then used to elute the product. The fractions are then combined and concentrated in vacuo to give 6.1 g of the crude free base product as a light brown solid (Note 15). A final purification is then carried out (Note 16). The solids are transferred to a three-necked 250 mL flask (the necks contain an inert gas valve and two septa, one containing a thermocouple), followed by addition of 2-MeTHF (85 mL). The mixture is stirred for ca 5 min at 65 \u00b0C under N2 to give a brown solution. Methanesulfonic acid (1.95 mL, 30 mmol, 0.8 equiv) (Notes 17, 18 and 19) is then added at once via syringe, causing the immediate formation of a thick slurry of the MsOH salt. The suspension is stirred at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min, then heat is turned off and the mixture is allowed to cool slowly to ambient temperature (approximately three hours). The slurry is then filtered through a medium-fritted filter funnel using house vacuum, washing the cake with 2-MeTHF (1 x 20 mL). After 30 min, the dry solids are collected to give 8.7 g (76%) of the product salt as a tan powder (Notes 20, 21, and 22)."

The flask is dried with a heat gun under vacuum and cooled under a stream of nitrogen. The flask is charged with 2-picolinic acid (1) (6.15 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2), evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen three times, then charged with dichloromethane (300 mL, 0.17 M) (Note 3) and N-methylmorpholine (7.59 g, 8.25 mL, 75.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv). The flask is cooled in an ice/water bath and iso-butylchloroformate (6.86 mL, 7.17 g, 52.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) is added dropwise over 30 min by syringe pump. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min while remaining submerged in the ice/water bath. A separate 100 mL one-necked round-bottomed flask is sealed with a septum and connected via needle adapter to the two-tap Schlenk adapter and manifold, dried with a heat gun under vacuum, and allowed to cool under a stream of nitrogen.

            "A. (S)-1,1-Diphenylprolinol (1). A 1-L 24/40 three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar (15 x 32 mm). The left neck is capped with a rubber septum, the center neck is fitted with a Friedrich's condenser with an inert gas inlet connected to a dry nitrogen source and a bubbler, and the right neck with a 250-mL pressure equalizing addition funnel also capped with a rubber septum (Note 1). The flask is charged by syringe with 250 mL (0.25 mol, 2.5 equiv) of a 1M solution of phenylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 2). A solution of N-Boc-L-proline methyl ester (22.9 g, 100 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) in THF (200 mL) (Note 4), is charged to the dropping funnel via syringe and added dropwise to the solution of the Grignard reagent via the addition funnel over 45 min. The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature for 90 min, and then cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice water bath.\nFigure 1. Glassware Assembly for Step A\nThe reaction is quenched over 5 min by the controlled addition of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (150 mL) via addition funnel. The biphasic mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and diluted with water (150 mL). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 150 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate (15 g) and gravity filtered through a large powder funnel equipped with a conical medium porosity filter paper into a 1-L single-necked (24/40) round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg) at room temperature, providing a clear colorless residue.\nThe flask containing the residue is equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (15 x 32 mm). Ethanol (500 mL) (Note 5) is added to the flask, followed by sodium hydroxide (40.0 g, 1.00 mol, 10.0 equiv) (Note 6) and stirring is initiated. The flask is fitted with a Friedrich's condenser open to the atmosphere. The flask is heated to reflux using a 1-L electric heating mantle and allowed to stir at reflux for 1 h. Heating is discontinued, the Friedrich's condenser removed, and the reaction is concentrated by rotary evaporation using a 50 \u00b0C water bath (30 mmHg), providing a light yellow amorphous solid. The residue is dissolved in water (200 mL) and diethyl ether (200 mL), and the resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with water (200 mL) and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (200 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate (15.0 g), and filtered through a large powder funnel containing a conical medium porosity filter paper into a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 mmHg) at room temperature to afford a light yellow solid. The solid is dissolved in 200 mL of boiling hexanes, 2.5 g decolorizing carbon is added, and the solution is filtered hot through a large powder funnel equipped with a conical medium porosity filter paper into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, submerged in a water bath heated to 70 \u00b0C, that contains refluxing hexanes (30 mL). Once the filtration is complete, the flask is cooled to 0 \u00b0C and kept at 0 \u00b0C for 1 h, which results in crystallization (Note 7). The hexanes are decanted and the white crystals are washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) hexanes (3 x 20 mL), and the hexanes washes are successively decanted. The resulting moist crystalline solid is transferred to a 250-mL 24/40 single-necked round-bottomed flask that is then fitted with a vacuum adaptor and dried on a vacuum pump (0.15 mmHg) overnight (14 h) to provide 14.04-15.64 g (55-62%) of (S)-1,1-diphenylprolinol (1) as white crystals (Notes 8 and 9). A second crop of crystals can be obtained by concentrating the mother liquor and hexanes washes by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg) to dryness, dissolving the residue in 50 mL boiling hexanes, then cooling the solution to 0 \u00b0C and ageing the solution for 1 h at 0 \u00b0C. After decanting the hexanes, the resulting crystalline solids are washed with cold hexanes (3 x 10 mL), isolated by decantation, and dried under vacuum (0.15 mmHg) overnight (14 h) to give 3.09-4.44 g (12-18%) (Note 8) of white crystals of comparable purity to the first crop. The total yield is 17.44-19.16 g (69-76%) (Note 10) of (S)-1,1-diphenyl-prolinol (1) with a melting point of 73-74 \u00b0C.",

A 1-L 24/40 single-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (15 x 32 mm) and a 60 mL pressure equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The flask is placed under an atmosphere of nitrogen and flame dried. After cooling to ambient temperature, the flask is charged with a solution of (S)-1,1-diphenylprolinol (1) (17.7 g, 70.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dichloromethane (350 mL) (Note 11). The solution is cooled to -78 \u00b0C in a dry ice and acetone bath, followed by addition of triethylamine (12.7 mL, 9.20 g, 91.0 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 12) in one portion by syringe. Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (16.5 mL, 20.2 g, 91.0 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 13) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 30 min. The reaction mixture is stirred and allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C over 2 h. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 1 h. The reaction is quenched by addition of a solution of sat aq. sodium bicarbonate (100 mL) over 0.5 min. The mixture is diluted with water (100 mL) and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (15 g), then gravity filtered through a powder funnel equipped with a medium porosity conical filter paper. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg) to afford the impure product as an orange oil. Purification by column chromatography with elution by 60% diethyl ether/hexanes yields 17.51-17.60 g (77-78%) of (S)-1,1-diphenylprolinol trimethylsilyl ether (2) as a light yellow oil (Note 14)."

The septum is removed to add 3-(phenylsulfonyl)propanoic acid (1) (13.5 g, 64.0 mmol, 1 equiv). The septum is replaced, and 315 mL of methylene chloride is added by syringe (Note 8). The septum is removed to add dimethylaminopyridine (2.31 g, 18.9 mmol, 0.3 equiv) in one portion. The septum is reinserted and (3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methanol (9.9 mL, 0.10 mol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 9) is added to the reaction mixture by syringe over one min. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice water bath. After cooling, the septum is removed to allow for the addition of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (14.5 g, 75.6 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 10) in one portion (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Color of reaction after addition of EDC\nThe septum is quickly replaced, and the reaction is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature by allowing the ice water bath to warm to room temperature overnight (Note 11). When the reaction is determined to be complete by TLC (~16 h) (Note 12), the reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The crude mixture is partitioned between diethyl ether (200 mL) and water (200 mL), and the phases are separated in a 500-mL separatory funnel.

            "A. 1,3-Dimethyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium iodide (2). A three-necked, 300 mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 3.0 cm \u00d7 0.6 cm octagonal Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. The center neck is fitted with a reflux condenser, which is sealed with a rubber septum. One of the side necks is fitted with a rubber septum, and the other is fitted with a three-way stopcock. A nitrogen inlet hose is connected to the three-way stopcock and a nitrogen outlet needle is put into the septum. The flask is dried with a heat gun under vacuum and backfilled with nitrogen. With nitrogen gas flowing, N-methyl imidazole 1 (4.11 g, 50 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) is added via syringe (Note 1). Iodomethane (3.74 mL, 60 mmol) is taken up in a syringe, and the needle is inserted into the flask via the septum. Initially, about 1 mL of iodomethane is added, upon which the solution warms and boils gently. The remaining iodomethane is added periodically in portions over about 10 min to maintain a gentle boil. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1 h, during which time the solution cools to room temperature (Note 2). The three-way stopcock is replaced with a rubber septum. Without removing the stir bar, the needle and the condenser are removed and the solvent is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to give a pale yellow solid of salt 2 (11.3 g) (Note 3), which is used in the next step without further purification (Note 4).\nFigure 1. 1,3-Dimethyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium iodide",
            "B. 1,3-Dimethylimidazoyl-2-ylidene borane (3). The same three-necked flask is fitted with a reflux condenser on the center neck. A three-way stopcock with a hose, leading to the back of the fume hood, is placed on top of condenser to vent away the hydrogen gas that is generated. One of the side necks is sealed with a rubber septum. The other side neck is fitted with a three-way stopcock connected to a nitrogen inlet hose. After removing the septum, sodium borohydride (2.27 g, 60 mmol) is added by powder funnel. Toluene (50 mL) is added (Notes 5 and 6) to the solution through the funnel, rinsing the solid residues into the flask, and stirring is initiated. The side neck is closed with the septum.\nUnder a flow of nitrogen gas, the flask is immersed in a 125 \u00b0C oil bath. As the mixture nears the reflux point, the imidazolium salt begins to melt. A second ionic liquid phase forms and begins to bubble (Note 7). As the solution reaches reflux, an ionic liquid phase is visible as a white viscous material on the bottom and the top of the toluene, with droplets periodically floating up and sinking down through the toluene, creating exchange between the sunken and floating layers. Over about 8 h, the white liquid phase becomes more viscous and gradually adheres to the inside of the flask. Eventually the top phase and the exchanging droplets disappear. After 20 h at reflux, the mixture is cooled to give a largely clear toluene phase with a white, glue-like material adhering to the inside of the flask.\nFigure 2. Reaction Set-up for Step B\nThe toluene phase contains most of the product, and it is carefully decanted from the insoluble viscous material while still hot (Note 8). Additional toluene (25 mL) is added to the reaction flask to cover the residue, then the condenser is put back in place and the mixture is heated to reflux to further extract remaining product from the mixture. After 15 min of stirring, the hot toluene is decanted again. The hot extraction process is repeated once more with fresh toluene (25 mL). The toluene extracts are combined, cooled, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to give the crude product (4.38-4.69 g) as a white solid (Note 9). The solid is recrystallized from water (about 14 mL/g) (Note 10) and the resulting colorless, needle-shaped crystals of 3 are isolated by vacuum filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with aliquots of ice-cold water (3 x 5 mL). The crystals are dried under high vacuum (0.3 mmHg) for 12 h at 50 \u00b0C to yield 2.58-2.78 g (47-51%) of compound 3 (Note 11).\nFigure 3. After refluxing 20 h. Figure 4.

Tetrahydrofuran (125 mL) is added to the round-bottomed flask by cannula and 3-fluoropyridine (4.3 mL, 4.9 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 23) is added via a plastic syringe. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidyl\u2212ZnCl\u2022LiCl (2) (0.41 M, 122 mL, 112.0 g, 50 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is transferred by cannula to the addition funnel and then slowly added dropwise over ca. 15 min to the reaction at room temperature (Note 24) (Figure 3). The resulting orange solution is stirred at room temperature for 4 h.\nFigure 3. Addition of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl\u2212ZnCl\u2022LiCl\nAn oven-dried, 250-mL, 24/40 pear-shaped flask equipped with a 2 cm ellipsoid-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged tert-butyl-4-(benzoyloxy)piperazine-1-carboxylate (1) (18.4 g, 60.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and copper(II) acetate (454 mg, 2.50 mmol, 0.05 equiv) (Note 25). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and subjected to three cycles of evacuation and refilling with nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran (125 mL) (Note 17) is transferred by cannula to the flask. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 10 min and is then cannula transferred over ca. 10 min to the aryl zincate mixture at room temperature (Note 26). The reaction flask is inserted into an oil bath at 50 \u00b0C. The reaction is allowed to stir at 50 \u00b0C for 18.5 h and is then removed from heat and cooled to room temperature over 20 min (Notes 26 and 27). The orange-brown solution is directly vacuum filtered (Note 28) through neutral alumina (166 g) (Note 29) in a medium porosity fritted glass funnel, washed with ethyl acetate (500 mL) (Note 8), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (Note 30) to give a thick brown oil. The crude residue is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (Note 31) to afford tert-butyl-4-(3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (3) (7.05\u22127.77 g, 50\u221253%) as a yellow oil that crystallizes very slowly at 4 \u00b0C (Notes 32 and 33)."

A flame-dried, 500-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 3.5 cm football-shaped magnetic stir bar and thermometer, is charged with N-Boc-l-tryptophan methyl ester (1, 6.31 g, 19.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv), (1,5-cyclooctadiene)(methoxy)iridium(I) dimer (328 mg, 0.500 mmol, 0.025 equiv), and 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (266 mg, 0.991 mmol, 0.05 equiv) (Note 1). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum secured by copper wire and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere after three successive vacuum-argon cycles conducted slowly using a needle inlet through the septum (Figure 1). Fresh anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (180 mL) (Note 2) is introduced into the flask via a syringe to afford a dark brown solution. Using a syringe, 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (2, 14.4 mL, 99.1 mmol, 5.00 equiv) (Note 1) is added in a single portion, whereupon the solution rapidly changes color from brown to dark red. This reaction solution is stirred and maintained at 60 \u00b0C. After 13 h, TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of starting material 1 (Notes 3 and 4).\nFigure 1. Reaction Apparatus (photo provided by checkers)\nThe reaction solution is cooled to 23 \u00baC, and is concentrated under reduced pressure (20 mmHg, 30 \u00baC) to afford a dark brown residue.

The mixture is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 30 \u00b0C for 12 h (Note 5), at which time TLC analysis indicates complete consumption of the 2,7-diboronated intermediate. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 23 \u00baC, filtered through Celite using a glass-sintered funnel (9 cm diameter, 4 cm height), and the filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The filtrate is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (500 mL), the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 300 mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (15 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure (20 mmHg, 30 \u00baC).

Phosphoric acid (10.0 mL) (Note 3) is added slowly over 1 min, and the mixture is stirred for 50 min (Note 4). Polyphosphoric acid (56.7 g, Note 5) is added to the reaction mixture slowly over 30 min with continuous stirring (Note 6). The reaction flask is equipped with a Dimroth condenser, and is placed in a pre-heated oil bath (85 \u00baC). The bath temperature is raised to 120 \u00b0C within 1 h under air atmosphere (Note 7). The resulting mixture is stirred at 120 \u00b0C for an additional 2 h, and then carefully poured into ice water (90 g ice, 20 mL water) in a 300 mL beaker (Note 8) with stirring by means of a glass rod (Note 9). The remaining crude product in the reaction flask is rinsed with water (3 x 10 mL) (Note 10) and dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL). All rinses are transferred to the beaker.

The flask is placed in an oil bath at 100 \u00b0C. The reaction temperature is monitored by a thermometer placed inside the reaction mixture. When the internal temperature reaches 90 \u00b0C (Note 3), Amberlyst\u00ae 15 (1 g, 10%w/w) (Note 4) is added. The stirring is continued for 15 min, during which time the internal temperature reaches 96-98 \u00b0C and the color of the reaction mixture turns brown (Note 5). After this period the flask is removed from the heat source and the solution separated from the Amberlyst\u00ae 15 by decantation of the hot solution into a 2-L single-necked round-bottomed flask (Note 6).

The septum is removed temporarily, N-Boc-glycine tert-butyl ester (10.0 g, 43.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) and N-Bromosuccinimide (8.10 g, 45.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 3) are added. The flask is placed under vacuum and backfilled with nitrogen three times after which chlorobenzene (175 mL, 0.25 M) (Note 4) is added. The flask is then cooled in an ice water bath, and irradiated with a 300 W tungsten lamp for 1 h (Note 5) (Figure 1) during which the colorless solution becomes a dark red solution. The suspension is filtered using a fritted filter funnel (4.5 cm diameter, Fine) and chlorobenzene is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (50 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The residue is further dried under high vacuum (1.0 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) for 2 h. The yellow crude oil is used in the next step without further purification (Note 6).\nFigure 1.

The center neck is equipped for mechanical stirring (Figure 1) (Note 2). The reactor is connected to a chiller (Note 3). The reactor is charged with nickel(II) chloride ethylene glycol dimethyl ether complex (1.11 g, 4.90 mmol, 0.050 equiv) (Note 4), 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-dipyridyl (1.48 g, 5.39 mmol, 0.055 equiv) (Note 5) and manganese powder (16.68 g, 303.6 mmol, 3.1 equiv) (Note 6). The system is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylacetamide (Note 7) (200 mL) is added to the reactor through the additional funnel by syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h under nitrogen flow. During this time the green reaction mixture turns to a dark green/black suspension. The stirred mixture is then cooled to an internal temperature at 0-2 \u00b0C over 0.5 h. 1-Iodooctane (24.0 g, 98.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and ethyl succinyl chloride (25.45 g, 146.9 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 8) are successively charged into the reactor via the addition funnel by syringe. The color of the reaction mixture changed to brown in 5 min. The reaction mixture is vigorously stirred at 0 to 2 \u00b0C for 14 h and then is allowed to warm to room temperature over 0.5 h and then stirred for another 3-6 h at room temperature (Note 9).\nFigure 1. Apparatus Assembly\nThe stirred reaction mixture is diluted by adding 1:1 hexanes/methyl tert-butyl ether (200 mL), resulting in the formation of a dark green/black precipitate. The mixture is drained from the reactor (Notes 10 and 11). The solids are removed by filtration through a celite bed (Note 12). The black solids are scraped off the top of the celite and transferred to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and stirred with 250 mL of deionized water for 1-2 min. The insoluble manganese salts are removed by vacuum filtration through the same celite bed and rinsed with deionized water (20 mL). The water filtrate is combined with the organic filtrate from the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is extracted with 1:1 hexanes/methyl tert-butyl ether (200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with deionized water (200 mL) followed by a final wash with saturated sodium chloride solution (250 mL). The product solution mixture is transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask and stirred over 20 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 15-20 min. The magnesium sulfate is removed by vacuum filtration of the dried solution using a 7 cm B\u00fcchner funnel. The solvents are distilled from the crude product mixture using a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 25-30 mmHg).\nA very small forerun (ca. 3 mL) is removed by distillation at 150 \u00b0C under vacuum (5-6 mmHg) (Figure 2). The pot is cooled to 23 \u00b0C before the vacuum is released, after which the forerun is discarded (Note 11).

A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask was equipped with an octagonal Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (25 mm x 10 mm), and a mixture of MeOH (Note 1) and Et2O (250 mL, 1:1 v/v) (Note 2) is added. Pyrene (1) (20.0 g, 98.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) is added with vigorous stirring, followed by addition of HBr (12.3 mL of 48% w/w aq solution, calculated to contain 8.8 g HBr, 109 mol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 4) via syringe. The round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 25-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, which is then charged with H2O2 (30% w/w aq, 3.54 g, 10.4 mL, 104 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 5). The reaction mixture is cooled to 15 \u00b0C using a water bath (Note 6), and the H2O2 slowly added over a period of 0.5 h (ca. 7 drops/min) (Note 7). The addition funnel is then replaced by a gas bubbler, the cooling bath removed, and the mixture stirred for 16 h at ambient temperature (Figure 1). Water (150 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 250 mL) (Note 8) in a 1-L separatory funnel. The combined organic extracts are washed with NaOH (1 M aq, 150 mL) (Note 9) and saturated aq NaCl (2 x 150 mL) (Note 10) in a 1-L separatory funnel, dried over MgSO4 (20 g, 5 min) (Note 11), and filtered through a plug of silica gel (Note 12), which is rinsed with CH2Cl2 (2 x 100 mL) (Note 8).\nFigure 1.

After cooling to room temperature, the n-pentane fraction, already containing crude precipitated pale yellow product, is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 675 mmHg) to 500 \u00b1 25 mL and placed in a refrigerator (ca. 2 \u00b0C) overnight. The formed precipitate is collected by gravity filtration, dried in vacuo (0.01 mmHg) for 2 h, dissolved in boiling hexanes (1.0 L) (Note 15) in a 2-L, round-bottomed flask, and placed in a freezer (ca. -20 \u00b0C) overnight. The formed precipitate is collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in vacuo (0.01 mmHg) for 8 h to give 18.9 g of the title compound 2 as a pale yellow, air-stable powder.

Fractions (35 mL) are collected in 20 x 150 mm test tubes. The desired product is obtained in fractions 70-164. These fractions are combined and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg for 10 h provides 3.15 g (88%) of 2 as a pale yellow solid (Notes 22 and 23) (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Product of Step B"

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and the center neck is fitted with a glass gas inlet adapter which is connected to a nitrogen/vacuum double manifold. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa. The flask is charged with molecular sieves 4 \u00c5 (40 g) (Note 1). The system is flame-dried under vacuum and backfilled with nitrogen (Note 2). After flame drying the right neck of the flask is equipped with a temperature probe. To the flask are added anhydrous dichloromethane (300 mL, via cannula) (Note 3), morpholine (19.8 g, 19.9 mL, 227 mmol, via syringe) (Note 4), and fluoral ethyl hemiacetal (32.7 g, 26.8 mL, 227 mmol, via syringe) (Note 5). After being stirred at room temperature for 5 min, the resulting mixture is heated in a 30 \u00b0C oil bath for 48 h (Notes 6 and 7) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Step A - Reaction 1 Set-up\nThe flask containing the mixture is then removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is then vacuum filtered through a 350 mL fine-fritted glass funnel, which is packed with a 20g pad of Celite (Note 8). The Celite\u00ae pad and the reaction flask are washed with CH2Cl2 (3 x 100 mL) and the filtrate is transferred to 1 L recovery flask rinsing with dichloromethane (2 x 50 mL). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to afford 40.6 g of trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiaminal 2 as a pale yellow oil, which is used in the next step (silylation) without purification (Note 9).\nFor the silylation step, a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and the center neck is fitted with a glass gas inlet adapter which is connected to a nitrogen/vacuum double manifold. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum and backfilled with nitrogen. After flame drying the right neck of the flask is equipped with a temperature probe. A solution of trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiaminal 2 (40.6 g, 219 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (75 mL) (Notes 10 and 11) is prepared and added to the dried flask via cannula. Additional THF (75 mL) is to rinse residual hemiaminal 2 into the three-necked flask. The resultant solution is cooled in an ice bath for 30 min (internal temperature : 2.7 \u00b0C).\nFigure 2. Step A - Reaction 2 Set-up\nTo the THF solution of hemiaminal 2 is added N-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole (30.8 g, 220 mmol) (Note 12) slowly at a rate of about 2 mL per minute (Note 13) (Figure 2). After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. After being stirred at room temperature for 6 h (Note 14), a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (150 mL) is added to the reaction and the resultant mixture. transferred to a 1L separatory funnel. Separation of the phases is followed by extraction of the aqueous phase with hexanes (3 x 200 mL) (Note 15). The combined hexanes extracts are washed successively with brine (2 x 100 mL), and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (130 g) (Note 16). The sodium sulfate was removed by vacuum filtration using a glass fritted filter. After rinsing the filter cake with hexane (2 x 50 mL) the filtrate is poured into a 1 L recovery flask rinsing with hexanes (1 x 25 mL). The solvent is then removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation to yield 4-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(trimethylsilyloxy)ethyl]morpholine (3, 46.6-48.7 g, 181-189 mmol, 80-83% over two steps) (Notes 17 and 18) as a pale colorless liquid that is used for step B without further purification (Note 19).",

A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and the center neck is fitted with a glass gas inlet adapter which is connected to a nitrogen/vacuum double manifold. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa. The flask is charged with CsF (29.3 g, 193 mmol) (Note 20), flame-dried under vacuum and then backfilled with nitrogen. After flame drying is complete, the right neck of the flask is equipped with a thermometer. To the flask are added copper(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate (CuTC, 1.84 g, 9.65 mmol) (Note 21), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen, 1.74 g, 9.65 mmol) (Note 22), m-iodonitrobenzene (24.0 g, 96.5 mmol) (Note 23) and anhydrous diglyme (180 mL) (Note 24). Next, 4-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(trimethylsilyloxy)ethyl] morpholine (3, 49.6 g, 193 mmol) in 10 mL anhydrous diglyme is transferred by cannula to the reaction flask rinsing with an additional 10 mL of anhydrous diglyme (Note 25). The resulting mixture is heated in a 80 \u00b0C oil bath for 24 h (Notes 26 and 27) (Figure 3). After cooling to room temperature the reaction is quenched by the addition of deionized water (250 mL) and the resultant mixture poured into a 2L separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 150 mL). The combined extracts are washed successively with water (5 x 300 mL) and brine (1 x 300 mL) (Note 28), and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (90 g). Removal of the sodium sulfate by filtration through a fritted filter with rinsing (Et2O, 3 x 50 mL) was followed by solvent removal on a rotary evaporator (Note 29). The resultant residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 30). The fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide pure 3-nitro-1-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (5) as a yellow liquid (14.3 g, 78 %) (Notes 31 and 32).\nFigure 3.

The reaction filtrate is added slowly to this stirred solution (Note 10) and stirring is continued for >30 min, or until all effervescence had ceased. The solution is then transferred to a 1.0 L separating funnel and the organic/aqueous layers separated. The aqueous phase is extracted once with EtOAc (50 mL) and the organics combined, washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over MgSO4 (10.0 g) for 10 min, and filtered through a sintered glass funnel into a flask. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to reveal a sticky, brown oil mixed with solids. This residue is dissolved in hot (70 \u00b0C) EtOH (50 mL) and allowed to cool, which induces crystallisation of 2. The solids are collected by vacuum filtration (Note 11) and dried under vacuum for 2 h (5 mmHg) furnishing 3.40 g (32%) of 2 as a light tan solid (Figure 4) (Notes 12 and 13).\nFigure 4.

            "A. 3-Amino-3-(hydroxymethyl)-1,5-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane. A 1-L single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.5 cm x 1.5 cm), capped with a rubber septum, flame-dried under vacuum, and cooled under an argon atmosphere (Note 1). After cooling to ambient temperature (21-23 \u00b0C), to the flask is added anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 365 mL, 0.78 M) via cannula. Subsequently, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (45.0 g, 286 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2 and 3) is added in a single portion as white crystalline solid. The reaction vessel is immediately resealed with a rubber septum under inert atmosphere and stirring is commenced (Figure 1). To this white suspension is added 1,1-dimethoxycyclohexane (50.0 mL, 47.4 g, 329 mmol, 1.15 equiv) via syringe in one portion (Note 4). Lastly, to the off-white slurry is added para-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (p-TsOH\u2022H2O, 1.63 g, 8.57 mmol, 0.03 equiv) as a solid in one portion quickly, immediately replacing the rubber septum to maintain an inert atmosphere.\nFigure 1. Heterogeneous Reaction Mixture at Initiation of Transketalization\nAfter stirring for 18 h at ambient temperature, the off-white heterogeneous reaction mixture becomes a completely homogenous, pale yellow solution (Figure 2, Note 5). The reaction flask is then placed in an oil bath and the rubber septum is replaced with a short path distillation head with a hollow water-jacketed column 6.0 cm in length, equipped with a thermometer and a 500-mL single-necked, round-bottomed receiving flask being cooled in an ice-water bath (Figure 3, Note 6). The volatiles are distilled off under high vacuum with heating (Note 7) and vigorous stirring (Note 8) to furnish an extremely viscous off-white semi-solid (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 2. Homogeneous Reaction Mixture at Completion of Transketalization\nFigure 3. Distillation Apparatus Before Introduction of Heating and Cooling Baths (Baths Omitted for Visual Clarity)\nThis residue is triturated with diethyl ether (700 mL), resulting in the precipitation of a white solid (Note 9). The heterogeneous suspension is then filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (Note 10). The solid is then washed with a single 100 mL portion of ethyl acetate. The lumpy white solid is then briefly dried for 2-3 min by pulling air through the sintered glass funnel and then ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle (Note 11). Once thoroughly ground, the white solid is triturated with three 100 mL portions of ethyl acetate in a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (Note 10). The resultant white powder is dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 0.40 mmHg) for 12 h to afford an amorphous white solid (63 g).\nFigure 4. Semi-Solid Product After Distillation\nFollowing trituration, this white solid (63 g) is split into two equal portions and each portion is added to a separate 1-L single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.5 cm x 1.5 cm) (Note 12). To each of these round-bottomed flasks is added ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 400 mL) (Note 13) and stirring commenced. To each white, heterogeneous suspension is then added triethylamine (Et3N, 23.7 mL, 179 mmol) (Note 14) dropwise over 6 min. After 12 h, each white, heterogeneous reaction mixture is filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (Note 10), collecting the filtrate in a 1-L round-bottomed flask. For each portion, the filter cake (\"Solid A\") is subsequently washed with ethyl acetate (4 x 50 mL). The washes are combined with the filtrate, concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg), and dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 0.40 mmHg) for 12 h to afford a fluffy white solid (the free-base amino alcohol, \"Solid B\"). The two filter cakes (Solid A) are then combined in a 1-L single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.5 cm x 1.5 cm) and suspended in ethyl acetate (250 mL) with stirring. Triethylamine (18.0 mL, 129 mmol) (Note 15) is subsequently added dropwise over 3 min. The pure white suspension is stirred vigorously for 24 h and then filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (Note 10). The filter cake is then washed with ethyl acetate (4 x 75 mL). The filtrate and washes are added to the flask containing Solid B and then concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) to furnish 3-amino-3-(hydroxymethyl)-1,5-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane (42.6 g, 74% combined yield over the two iterations, melting point: 91-92 \u00b0C) as an amorphous white solid (Notes 16 and 17).",
            "B. 1,5-Dioxaspiro[5.5]undecan-3-one. 3-Amino-3-(hydroxymethyl)-1,5-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane (31.4 g, 156 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 18) is added to a 2-L three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped, Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.5 cm x 1.5 cm) and suspended in water (520 mL). The flask is fitted with a pressure-equalizing 250-mL addition funnel capped with a rubber septum in the middle neck, a rubber septum equipped with a thermometer in one of the side necks, and capped with a rubber septum in the third neck (Figure 5). Subsequently, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4, 25.5 g, 187 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is added. Stirring is commenced and the heterogeneous white suspension is cooled in an ice-water bath (Note 19). To the resultant stirred heterogeneous reaction mixture is added a solution of sodium (meta)periodate (NaIO4, 33.4 g, 156 mmol, 1.00 equiv) as a pale yellow solution in water (520 mL, 0.30 M) dropwise over 3 h through the addition funnel (Note 20). The reaction is then allowed to stir for 1.0 h before removing the ice-water bath (Note 21) and allowing the homogenous, pale yellow reaction mixture to warm slowly. The starting material is completely consumed 3.0 h after removing the cooling bath as determined by TLC (Note 22, Figure 6). Anhydrous sodium thiosulfate (24.7 g, 156 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 23) is then immediately added in one portion (Note 24). The solution is allowed to stir for 20 min at which time the pale yellow homogenous reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The aqueous reaction mixture is extracted with dichloromethane (12 x 150 mL) (Note 25). The organic layers are combined in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a cylindrical, Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar (7.4 cm x 1.2 cm) and dried over 400 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 20 min with stirring. The organic solution is subsequently filtered through grade 4 filter paper and concentrated in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 50 mmHg) and under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 0.4 mmHg, 20 min) to afford 1,5-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecan-3-one (25.5 g, 96% yield, boiling point: 82-88 \u00b0C, 0.60 mmHg) as a pale yellow oil (Notes 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30).\nFigure 5.

            "A. 2-(Phenylethynyl)phenol (3). A flame-dried 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar (Note 1) is charged with 2-iodophenol (1, 14.0 g, 63.6 mmol, 1.00 equiv), copper iodide (1.09 g, 5.71 mmol, 0.09 equiv), and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride (1.33 g, 1.89 mmol, 0.03 equiv) (Notes 2 and 3). The flask is then covered with a rubber septum. A needle is then placed in the septum and the flask is then flushed with nitrogen (Note 4). The flask is then kept under a dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. Toluene (320 mL) is then added via cannula, followed by diisopropylamine (8.90 mL, 63.6 mmol, 1.00 equiv) using a 24-mL syringe in one portion (Notes 5 and 6). Phenylacetylene (2) (10.5 mL, 95.4 mmol, 1.50 equiv) is then added via a 24-mL syringe over five min (Notes 7 and 8, Figure 1). The reaction is stirred for 8.5 h at 25 \u00b0C (Note 9).\nFigure 1. Step A - Color before and after addition of 2\nThe septum is removed, and the reaction mixture is filtered through a plug of celite (Note 10). The mixture is then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The filter flask is rinsed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate and added to the separatory funnel. The organic layer is rinsed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (1 \u00d7 50 mL), saturated aqueous brine (1 \u00d7 50 mL), and then transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing anhydrous sodium sulfate (55 g) and allowed to sit for 15 min. The solid sodium sulfate is then removed by filtration through a medium porosity 150-mL filter funnel (200 mmHg applied vacuum), and the resulting solution is collected into a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) (Note 11). The dark brown oil is then purified by flash chromatography using an eluent mixture of 12% ethyl acetate in hexanes as the eluent (Note 12). The collected fractions are placed in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask and then concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) and then placed under high vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) for 13 h (Note 13). The brown residue is recrystallized from hexanes to afford 6.34 g (51.4%) of 2-(phenylethynyl)phenol (3) as a brown crystalline solid (Notes 14, 15, 16, and 17).",
            "B. 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(2-phenylbenzofuran-3-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (4). This procedure is carried out in an argon-filled glove box (Note 18). A 500-mL round-bottomed flask is charged with a stir bar, sodium hydride (0.81 g, 31 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 92% wt.), and toluene (192 mL) (Notes 19 and 20). In a separate 20-mL vial, compound 3 (6.1 g, 31 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is dissolved in toluene (15 mL). This solution is drawn into a 24-mL syringe with a long-stem needle. The vial is then rinsed with toluene (3 mL), which is also drawn into the same syringe. This solution is then added to the reaction flask over 30 min (Note 21, Figure 2). The reaction is then stirred for an additional 15 min.\nFigure 2. Step B - Part a - Reaction mixture during addition of 3\nIn a separate 20-mL vial, B-chlorocatecholborane (4.8 g, 31 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is dissolved in toluene (15 mL) (Note 22). This solution is then drawn up into another 24-mL syringe equipped with a long stem needle. The vial is rinsed with toluene (3 mL), which is then drawn up into the same syringe. This combined solution is then added to the reaction mixture in the round-bottomed flask over 1 min and then the flask is capped with a glass stopper equipped with a Teflon ring. The reaction mixture is then stirred for 30 min (Note 23). In another 20\u2011mL vial, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl-imidazol-2-ylidene)gold(I) chloride, also known as IPrAuCl, (0.58 g, 0.94 mmol, 3.0 mol%) is dissolved in toluene (18 mL) (Note 24). This suspension is then transferred via pipette to the reaction mixture over 1 min. The vial is then rinsed with 10 mL toluene and this rinse is added via pipette to the reaction mixture. Sodium trifluoroacetate (1.3 g, 9.4 mmol, 0.30 equiv) is added to a 20-mL vial, and then added in one portion to the reaction mixture (Note 25). This vial is then rinsed with toluene (6 mL), and this toluene is then added to the reaction mixture via pipette. The round\u2011bottomed flask is then capped with a glass stopper equipped with a Teflon ring, and a Keck plastic joint clip. The flask is placed in a pre-heated sand bath (60 \u00b0C) and allowed to stir in the glovebox for 21 h (Figure 3)\nFigure 3. Step B - Part c - Reaction mixture heated to 60 \u00b0C\nAt this time, TLC indicated that the reaction is complete (Note 26). The mixture is then cooled to room temperature before triphenylphosphine (0.41 g, 1.6 mmol, 5.0 mol%) is added in one portion (Note 27). The reaction flask is then allowed to stir for 3 h. In a separate 100-mL round-bottomed flask, pinacol (11 g, 94 mmol, 3.0 equiv) is dissolved in triethylamine (65 mL, 470 mmol, 15 equiv) (Note 28). This solution is added to the reaction mixture via pipette over 4 min (Note 29). The flask is capped with a glass stopper, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h. The flask is then taken out of the glovebox and the resulting suspension is filtered through celite, using toluene (200 mL) as a rinse (Note 30). The recovered liquid is transferred to a clean 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg). The dark brown oil is then dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and transferred to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask and then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg). The mixture is then placed under high vacuum (0.2 mmHg) for 16 h (Note 31). Column chromatography using 20% dichloromethane in hexanes yielded 7.26 g (73%) of a light yellow solid after drying under high vacuum for 18 h (25 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) (Notes 32, 33, and 34)."

            "1-Iodopropyne (1). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer with a 19 x 60 mm teflon paddle, a 125-mL graduated pressure-equalizing addition funnel topped with a rubber septum with an argon inlet needle, and a rubber septum equipped with a thermocouple probe (Notes 1 and 2) (see Figure 1). The flask is charged with 150 mL of THF (Note 3), cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath, and 1-bromo-1-propene (15 mL, 21 g, 174 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 4) is added in one portion by syringe. The resulting solution is cooled to -73 \u00b0C (internal temperature) and n-BuLi solution (114 mL, 293 mmol, 2.2 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise via the graduated addition funnel at such a rate so as to maintain the internal temperature between -58 and -63 \u00b0C (Note 6). The walls of the addition funnel are rinsed with two 5-mL portions of THF delivered by syringe. The resulting pale yellow reaction solution is stirred further for 2 h at -73 \u00b0C (internal temperature), and a solution of iodine (29.7 g, 117 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in 80 mL of THF (Note 7) is then added via cannula directly into the flask via the septum at such a rate so as to maintain the internal temperature between -58 and -63 \u00b0C (Note 8).\nFigure 1. Reaction Assembly\nThe resulting turbid brown solution is stirred at -73 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 20 min, the dry ice/acetone bath is replaced with a room temperature water bath, and the reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) over 5 min. At this point a solution of 5.5 g of NaH2PO4 in 125 mL of deionized water is added to the reaction mixture via the addition funnel over 2 min (Note 9).\nThe contents of the reaction flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel (the flask is rinsed with ca. 20 mL of pentane and 20 mL of water) (Note 10) and the milky aqueous layer is separated and extracted with pentane (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of saturated NaCl solution, dried over 10 g of MgSO4 for ca. 10 min, and gravity filtered through filter paper with the aid of 25 mL of pentane into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 32 x 15 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar. The filtrate is concentrated to a volume of approximately 25 mL by distillation at atmospheric pressure under argon (oil bath temperature gradually raised from 50 to 95 \u00b0C) through a 32-cm Vigreux column (Notes 11 and 12) into a 1-L flask cooled at 0 \u00b0C (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Initial Concentration of Reaction Product Solution\nThe residual yellow solution (ca. 25 mL) in the distillation pot is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask (containing a 13 x 8 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar) using 10 mL of pentane to rinse the 1-L flask. To concentrate the resulting solution, the flask is equipped with a 26-cm Vigreux column (Note 11) topped with a short path distillation head with a 50-mL pear-shaped receiving flask (Note 12). The receiving flask is cooled at 0 \u00b0C with an ice water bath (Figure 3). Distillation is carried out at atmospheric pressure, gradually raising the temperature of the oil bath until the vapor temperature at the distillation head reaches 85 \u00b0C. In this fashion, the pentane and most of the remaining THF and hexane are removed by distillation, concentrating the product solution to a volume of ca. 20 mL. (Notes 13 and 14).\nFigure 3. Further Concentration of Reaction Product Solution\nThe reaction product is then distilled using the setup shown in Figure 4 (Note 12). The 50-mL flask containing the product is equipped with a 6-cm vacuum-jacketed micro Vigreux column (Figure 4) with a short-path distillation head attached to a 50-mL, three-necked, pear-shaped flask fitted with two glass stoppers secured with Teflon tape. The receiving flask is cooled in an ice water bath. Distillation of the product is carried out at atmospheric pressure under argon by raising the oil bath temperature from 25 to 130 \u00b0C over 30 min and then gradually from 130 to 150 \u00b0C over 30 min. The product is collected in a single fraction as 15.8-16.4 g (81-84%) of colorless liquid, 95% purity by QNMR (Note 15). Although this material is sufficiently pure for most purposes, product with greater than 98% purity can be obtained by low-temperature recrystallization according to the following procedure.\nFigure 4. Distillation of Iodopropyne\nLow-temperature recrystallization of the distilled product is carried out using the setup shown in Figure 5. The three-neck receiving flask from the distillation is disconnected from the distillation head and the center neck is equipped with a rubber septum pierced with a metal spatula (Figure 6) and the left neck is equipped with a pressure-equalized, jacketed 50-mL addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum and argon inlet needle. The right neck is fitted with a rubber septum pierced with a 16-gauge cannula with filter paper secured onto the blunt end with Teflon tape (Figure 7) and connected to a 50-mL two-neck pear-shaped flask. Initially the end of the cannula filter is maintained above the level of the contents of the flask.\nFigure 5. Set-up for Low-Temperature Recrystallization of Iodopropyne\nFigure 6. Close-up of Septum Pierced with Spatula\nFigure 7. Close-up View of Cannula Filter\nPentane (4.4 mL, Note 16) is added to the three-necked flask by syringe and a homogeneous solution is obtained by stirring with the spatula. The flask is placed in an acetone bath, and small pieces of dry ice are gradually added to the bath to slowly lower the bath temperature to -78 \u00b0C over a period of 90 min. When crystal formation begins, the metal spatula is used to periodically scrape crystals from the sides of the flask and to break up aggregates of crystals. The mixture is maintained at -78 \u00b0C for an additional 90 min, using the metal spatula to stir and scrape the crystals as needed to prevent a single large aggregate mass from forming (Figure 8).\nFigure 8. Appearance of Iodopropyne Crystals\nThe end of the cannula filter is then lowered to the bottom of the flask and the supernatant pentane is removed through the cannula by increasing the argon pressure (Note 17). The addition funnel is charged with 18 mL of pentane which is cooled to -78 \u00b0C by filling the jacket with dry ice/acetone. A portion of cold pentane (ca. 3 mL) is added to the crystals from the addition funnel, the cannula filter is raised above the level of the mixture, and the crystals are stirred with the metal spatula. The cannula filter is then lowered, a short outlet needle is inserted through the septum of the two-necked receiving flask, and the liquid is removed through the cannula by increasing the argon pressure. This washing process is repeated with five additional 3-mL portions of cold pentane. After removal of the last portion of pentane, the metal spatula is used to distribute the crystals along the walls of the flask so as to expose as much surface area as possible for subsequent drying.\nWith the flask still immersed in the dry ice/acetone bath, the addition funnel is rapidly replaced with an inlet adapter connected to a double manifold. The septa on the other necks (with metal spatula and cannula filter) are quickly replaced with glass stoppers, which are secured to the flask with Teflon tape (Note 18). Residual pentane is removed in vacuo (0.5-1.0 mmHg, 1 h) at -78 \u00b0C. The flask is back filled with argon, and the dry ice/acetone bath is replaced with a room temperature water bath. Upon warming to room temperature, the colorless crystals melt to afford 13.2 g (68%, >98% pure by QNMR) (Note 19) of 1-iodopropyne as a colorless liquid (Notes 20 and 21)."

The side arm of the flask is connected to Schlenk line and the flask is cooled to room temperature under vacuum and back-filled with nitrogen. Potassium tert-butoxide (1.34 g, 12.0 mmol, 0.2 equiv) is added to the flask under positive nitrogen flow (Notes 2 and 3), and then the flask is evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen three times. N-Methylindole (7.48 mL, 7.86 g, 60.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and triethylsilane (28.6 mL, 20.82 g, 179.5 mmol, 3.0 equiv) are added sequentially via syringe through the septum, resulting in a yellow heterogeneous mixture (Figure 1). After the septum is replaced with a glass stopper (Note 4), the reaction mixture is degassed (Note 5) and stirred at 45 \u00baC for 76 h (Note 6), resulting in a dark purple solution.

Reaction Setup: Steps A and B\nThe septum is replaced and toluene (210 mL) is added via syringe, the resulting light brown solution is stirred for 10 min before aniline (20.0 mL, 219 mmol, 1.05 equiv) is added via syringe in one portion. The resulting dark brown mixture is heated to 100 \u00b0C in a heating mantle over 20 min and stirred for 16 h (Note 2). The reaction is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath and 2 M HCl (300 mL) is added. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 10 min at room temperature before filtering through a pad of Celite 545 (15 g) in a 350-mL, medium-porosity, fritted funnel. The filtrate is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, the layers are separated, and the organic phase is further extracted with 2 M HCl (2 x 50 mL). The combined acidic extracts are cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath and dichloromethane (100 mL) is added. The biphasic solution is then treated with 19 M NaOH (50 mL) and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel.

The filtrate is collected into two 1-L flasks. The first 500 mL fraction is colorless and the second 500 mL fraction has a subtle tint of yellow (Figure 3). Both fractions were concentrated to give a yellow liquid. 1H NMR analyses of both fractions were identical; therefore the two fractions were combined to give 34.5 g (82%) of 3-chloro-N-phenyl-pyridin-2-amine as a yellow liquid, which formed beige crystals when cooled in a -20 \u00b0C freezer (Notes 4 and 5).\nFigure 2.

The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 10 min via a nitrogen line inlet and then 40 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 2) is added by syringe. The reaction flask is placed in a dry ice-acetone bath. Nonafluoro-1-iodobutane (3.53 mL, 20.5 mmol, 1.55 equiv) (Note 3) is added by syringe, and the resulting solution is stirred at 700 rpm while an ~3 M ethylmagnesium bromide solution in diethyl ether (6.76 mL, 2.94 M, 19.9 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Notes 3 and 4) is added dropwise via a syringe over 3 min with the internal temperature maintained below -65 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the reaction solution turns from a clear light yellow color to a cloudy mixture. The fume hood light is turned off, and the flask is covered with aluminum foil to protect the reaction mixture from light, and the Grignard reagent mixture is stirred for 1 h at -78 \u00b0C. While the Grignard reagent mixture is being stirred, to a separate one-necked oven-dried 100 mL round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground glass joint is charged with the oxathiazolidine oxide 1 (5.0 g, 13.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) prepared using the previously reported two-step Organic Syntheses procedure.3 After fitting the flask with a rubber septum and flushing it with nitrogen for 5 min, 40 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2) is added by syringe before the mixture is shaken until complete dissolution has occurred. The resulting THF solution is transferred via cannula to the 250 mL flask containing the Grignard reagent (1 h after ethylmagnesium bromide addition) in under 6 min while keeping the internal temperature below -60 \u00b0C.

After warming up to ambient temperature over ca. 30 min, the mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. Additional deionized water (40 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL) are used to ensure that all of the product is transferred.

A flame dried 250 mL three-necked indented Morton style round bottom flask with 24/40 ground glass joints is equipped with a 3 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and is fitted with two rubber septa and an oven dried 125 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with 24/40 ground glass joints and a rubber septum at the top. The flask is flushed with nitrogen via a nitrogen line inlet for 10 min and then charged with 7.0 g of 2 at which point a rubber septum is replaced with a low temperature thermometer as an internal temperature probe (Note 1). To the flask is then added 22 mL of anhydrous THF via syringe (Note 2) followed by stirring at 700 rpm to give a 0.3 M clear yellow solution of 2 in THF. The solution is cooled to an internal temperature of -78 \u00b0C using a dry ice-acetone bath. A 2.0 M solution of NaHMDS in THF (17.6 mL, 35.1 mmol, 3 equiv assuming crude 2 is 100% pure) (Notes 3 and 9) is then added dropwise via the 125 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel over 5 min with the internal temperature maintained below -65 \u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for 3.5 h at -78 \u00b0C at which time the appearance of the solution changes to a dark brown color. The reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 10). The reaction is quenched by addition of 40 mL of saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution dropwise via the equipped pressure-equalizing addition funnel over 10 min with the internal temperature maintained below -60 \u00b0C. After removing the dry ice-acetone bath, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over ~30 min. The biphasic mixture is then stirred at 1000 rpm for 16 h at ambient temperature (Note 11). The mixture is then transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel with additional deionized water (20 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL) used to ensure the complete transfer of crude product. The aqueous layer is separated and further extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (15 mL) and then dried over sodium sulfate (15 g, 10 min). The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration through a 60 mL medium fritted glass funnel and washed with three 10 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The filtrate is concentrated using a rotary evaporator (26 \u00b0C, <50 mmHg) to afford a brown oil. For purification, the crude material is solubilized in 3 mL of 10% MTBE (by volume) in dichloromethane and loaded onto a 6.5 cm diameter column (35 cm in length) containing 250 mL (about 100 g) of silica gel (Note 12) that has been prepacked with 10% MTBE (by volume) in dichloromethane. The flask is washed with 10% MTBE (by volume) in dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL) with the washings loaded onto the silica gel. Fractions are collected using 18 x 150 mm disposable culture tubes using 10% MTBE (by volume) in dichloromethane as eluent. To recover 4, fractions containing the N-sulfonylaminoindanol 4 and its O-silyl-protected derivative are identified by TLC, (Note 13) combined, and subjected to silyl deprotection using TBAF (Note 14). Fractions containing the product sulfinamide 3 are combined and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (26 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg). This solid material is subsequently dried with a high vacuum line (1.1 mmHg) to provide 2.50 g (76% over two steps) (Note 15) of enantioenriched (>99% ee) (Note 16) (S)-nonafluorobutanesulfinamide 3 as an off-white solid, mp 73-75 \u00b0C (Notes 17 and 18)."

To this flask is added hydroxylamine hydrochloride (11.2 g, 0.161 mol) (Note 1) and sodium carbonate (21.2 g, 0.20 mol, Note 1) followed by distilled water (60 mL) and the resulting white suspension cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath (Figure 1A). The headspace in the flask is flushed with nitrogen, the flask fitted with a rubber septum and placed under a positive pressure of nitrogen via a syringe needle to a manifold (Figure 1A). After stirring the suspension for 5 min, an aqueous solution of glyoxal (23.0 mL, 40% w/v aq., 8.8 M, 0.20 mol) is added via syringe over 5 min resulting in the suspension becoming pale yellow in color (Note 2) (Figure 1B/C). An aqueous solution of methylamine (17.0 mL, 40% w/v aq., 11.6 M, 0.20 mol) is added via syringe over 5 min. The addition causes an immediate orange/red coloration of the suspension which darkens progressively during the addition to become a red/brown suspension upon complete addition (Note 3) (Figure 1D/E). An aqueous solution of formaldehyde (15.0 mL, 37% w/v aq., 13.4 M, 0.20 mol) is then added via syringe over 5 min during which the brown color is maintained (Note 4) (Figure 1F). The reaction mixture is then stirred for 16 h at room temperature under nitrogen.\nFigure 1.

The reaction mixture becomes a yellow/orange suspension and this suspension is stirred for a further 2 h at room temperature (Figure 2A).\nThe reaction mixture is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel (5 cm diameter) and the filtrate concentrated at reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (45 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg) to afford a brown slurry (Figure 2B). To this residue is added a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol/triethylamine (300 mL, 80:15:5) and after vigorous swirling the resulting mixture is filtered again using a 5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 6). The collected solid residue is washed with a further 100 mL of dichloromethane/meth-anol/triethylamine (80:15:5 v/v) and the filtrates combined (TLC; 20% methanol in dichloromethane + 0.5% triethylamine, Rf = 0.37, Figure 2C). To the resulting combined brown filtrate solution is added silica gel (15 g) (Note 7) and the mixture concentrated at reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (45 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg) to afford an orange solid. This solid is dry-loaded and purified by flash chromatography (Note 8) to afford the product as brown oil which solidifies upon standing in a fridge or freezer (10.8 g, 68%) (Notes 9 and 10) (Figure 3).\nFigure 2.

A 500 mL round-bottomed Airfree reaction flask with a 24/40 jointed neck and side-arm equipped with valve (Flask A) is charged with 20.6 g of 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves and sealed with a silicone-greased 24/40 glass stopper (Figure 1), then flame-dried under vacuum for approximately 10 min (Note 1). Flask A is then refilled with dry nitrogen, the glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum, and Flask A is allowed to cool to room temperature. To Flask A is added a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm \u00d7 8 mm). Anhydrous toluene (PhMe) (128 mL) (Note 2), 4-pentyn-1-ylbenzene (1) (6.83 mL, 45.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) (3.25 mL, 54.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv of hydride) (Note 4) are added sequentially by syringe, followed by isobutanol (5.00 mL, 54.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv), also by syringe (Note 5). The contents of Flask A are stirred at 500 rpm at ambient temperature for approximately 40 min. While the solution in Flask A is stirring, a second 500 mL round-bottomed Airfree reaction flask with a 24/40 jointed neck and side-arm equipped with valve (Flask B) is charged with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm \u00d7 8 mm) and sealed with a silicone-greased 24/40 glass stopper, then flame-dried under vacuum.\nFigure 1. Apparatus Assembly for Flask A\nFlask B is then refilled with dry nitrogen, the glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum, and Flask B is allowed to cool to room temperature. To Flask B is added chloro[1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]-copper(I) (IPrCuCl) (109 mg, 0.22 mmol, 0.0050 equiv). Anhydrous PhMe (16 mL) and potassium tert-butoxide (KOt-Bu) (as 1 M solution in THF, 230 \u00b5L, 0.23 mmol, 0.0050 equiv) are added sequentially by syringe (Note 6). The contents of Flask B are stirred at 300 rpm at ambient temperature for 5 min, at which point the solution transitions from a slightly cloudy suspension to a clear, colorless solution (Figure 2). Additional anhydrous PhMe (16 mL) is added by syringe, and the contents of Flask B are allowed to stir for an additional 15 min. At this point, the stir rate of flask B is increased to 500 rpm, and the solution from Flask A is transferred over 10 min via cannula to Flask B. The resultant mixture undergoes a small amount of foaming and changes from a yellow to an ash color (Figure 3). The sieves that remain in Flask A are then rinsed several times with anhydrous PhMe (4 x 16 mL), transferring the solvent to Flask B by cannula after each rinse. The stir rate is increased to 700 rpm, and the contents of Flask B are allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 70 min, at which point the alkyne (1) is completely consumed based on GC analysis (Note 7).\nFigure 2.

A two-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (1.9 x 5.0 cm, Teflon-coated, egg-shaped) is flame-dried under vacuum and then allowed to cool. The flask is backfilled with nitrogen and diphenylacetyl chloride (1, 9.68 g, 37.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv, 90% technical grade), is weighed out on the benchtop, and added (Note 1). The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times, and then fitted with a rubber septum and Schlenk nitrogen line. Dry dichloromethane (38.0 mL) and triethylamine (5.4 mL, 38.7 mmol, 1.02 equiv) are added by syringe through the septum and the mixture became yellow and heterogeneous (Figure 1) within minutes (Notes 2, 3, and 4). The reaction is stirred at room temperature for 30 min.\nFigure 1. Reaction Mixture after Addition of Triethylamine\nThe flask is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 \u00b0C) and cyclopentene (7.0 mL, 79.2 mmol, 2.1 equiv) is added down the walls of the flask by syringe through the septum (Note 5). The rubber septum is then quickly replaced with a 250 mL addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum that had been oven-dried and flushed with nitrogen. Ethylaluminum dichloride (95.0 mL, 95.0 mmol, 2.51 equiv, 1 M in hexanes) is added by syringe through the septum to the addition funnel (Notes 6 and 7). The solution of ethylaluminum dichloride is added dropwise to the flask over 50 min with continuous stirring and cooling (Notes 8, 9, and 10). After the addition, the reaction is stirred for 1 h at -78 \u00b0C (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Reaction Mixture after Addition of Ethylaluminum Dichloride\nThe addition funnel is removed and triethylamine (5 mL) is added down the walls of the flask over 5 min to quench the reaction. Deionized water (20 mL) is added directly to the reaction dropwise over 15 min. The flask is removed from the dry ice/acetone bath and the reaction is stirred until it reached room temperature (Note 11). As the solution warmed the color changed from brown to a light yellow. When the reaction reaches room temperature (~30 min) diethyl ether (100 mL) is added to the flask followed by 1 mL portion-wise addition of 1M HCl (100 mL) over 10 minutes with pipette (Notes 12 and 13) (Figure 3). The mixture stirred until it became mostly homogenous (~15 min). The biphasic mixture is then transferred to a 1000 mL separatory funnel. Diethyl ether (10 mL) and 1M HCl (10 mL) are used to rinse the round-bottomed flask and are then added to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated from the organic layer. The aqueous layer is washed with diethyl ether (100 mL). The layers are separated again; the organic phases are combined, and then are washed with 1M sodium hydroxide (100 mL) (Note 14). The separated organic layer is dried with sodium sulfate (50 g) over 10 min, gravity filtered through filter paper into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated via rotary evaporator (ca. 20 mmHg, water bath temperature 30 \u00b0C) (Note 15).\nFigure 3. Reaction Mixture after Addition of HCl\nThe crude residue is purified by a combination of silica gel flash column chromatography and recrystallization. Column chromatography using EtOAc and hexanes as eluent (Notes 16, 17 and 18) yielded the title compound as an air and moisture stable, light yellow amorphous solid, containing a small amount of impurities.\nThe chromatographed mixture of product and impurities is purified by recrystallization using hexanes and diethyl ether. To the crude solid in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask is added hexanes (50 mL) and diethyl ether (10 mL), and the resulting solution is swirled vigorously and gently warmed with a heat gun until all solids dissolved. The flask is loosely capped and left to sit at room temperature for 24 h while white needles form (Note 19). The mother liquor is decanted away into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask and the crystals are collected via vacuum filtration on a fritted B\u00fcchner funnel. The resulting crystals are transferred to a pre-weighed 250 mL round-bottomed flask and dried at 0.1 mmHg for 3 h to yield 2 (5.29 g, 20.16 mmol, 53%) as air and moisture stable white needles (Note 20) (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. White Crystalline Product\nAn additional crop of crystals could be obtained by a second recrystallization. The mother liquor is concentrated in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask via rotary evaporator (ca. 20 mmHg, water bath temperature 30 \u00b0C) to yield a white solid. To the crude solid is added hexanes (15 mL) and diethyl ether (3 mL) and the resulting solution is swirled vigorously and gently heated with a heat gun until all solids dissolved. The flask is loosely capped and left to sit at room temperature for 24 h while white needles form.

The reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature slowly (Note 6) and stirred overnight (ca. 18 h). The completion of the reaction is checked by TLC (Note 7). The reaction is quenched by the addition of water (150 mL), which causes the reaction to turn from a white-yellow suspension into a clear and biphasic system. The volatile components are removed by rotary evaporation (35 \u00baC, 4 mmHg). The solution is then acidified to pH 1 (Note 8) by addition of concentrated HCl (~15 mL) over a period of 5 min.

Stopcock A is closed, and the filter apparatus is purged by applying a vacuum (0.5 mmHg) via stopcock B and backfilling with argon three times. With stopcock A closed, the tube attached to the lower stopcock (tube A) is placed under vacuum. The reaction vessel's valve is then opened slowly. When ~3 cm of reaction mixture has collected above the frit, vacuum is gently applied to the flask by quickly opening and closing stopcock A. If the level of reaction mixture approaches stopcock B, the schlenk flask's valve is closed temporarily to prevent the reaction mixture from entering tube B. When all of the liquids have entered the collection flask, stopcock B is closed, and the solvent and excess amine are removed under high vacuum. The collection flask is placed in a warm water bath (~30 \u00b0C) to expedite the concentration, which takes ~30 minutes. Stopcock A is closed, and the apparatus backfilled with argon through stopcock B. The tube attached to stopcock A is backfilled with argon and removed from the apparatus, a rubber septum is placed over the end of the sidearm, and tube A is fitted with a luer-lock connector and a 1.5\" 18 gauge needle. A 50-mL round-bottomed flask with a 14/20 ground glass joint is fitted with a rubber septum, which is pierced with the needle on tube A. A cannula is placed between the 50-mL flask and the septum on sidearm A (Figure 4). The flask, cannula, and end of the sidearm are purged (0.6 mmHg) and backfilled with argon three times. Stopcock A is then opened and the crude ketene is transferred to the round-bottomed flask.\nFigure 4. Cannula placed between Round-bottomed Flask and the Schlenk Flask\nThe flask is backfilled with argon and the cannula removed. The septum is removed from the 50-mL flask and the flask is immediately attached to a vacuum distillation apparatus equipped with a multiflask collector (Figure 5) with tared receiving flasks. The distillation apparatus is then purged (0.5 mmHg) and backfilled with argon three times. The ketene is then distilled in one fraction (0.15 mmHg, 120 \u00b0C) (Note 20). Upon completion of the distillation, the apparatus is refilled with argon. The receiving flask is removed, and is quickly equipped with a septum.

A 250 mL, oven-dried, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with a 3.2 cm, Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and coupled with a 50 mL dropping funnel. Both the dropping funnel and the round-bottomed flask are sealed with a rubber septum. The system is evacuated for 10 min and back-filled with nitrogen. This process is repeated twice more, and then the flask is charged by syringe with pentane (180 mL), anhydrous pyridine (21.0 mL, 20.5 g, 260 mmol, 4 equiv), and anhydrous methanol (10.5 mL, 8.3 g, 260 mmol, 4 equiv) (Notes 1, 2, 3). Additionally, a solution of cyclohexyltrichlorosilane 1 (14.14 g, 65.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in pentane (37 mL) is prepared an addition funnel. (Figure 1, left) The stirred, homogeneous solution (Note 4) is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (external temperature) via an ice-water bath while under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1). After cooling for 10 min the solution in the dropping funnel is added dropwise to the flask over 35 min (Notes 5, 6, and 7). A voluminous white precipitate (pyridinium hydrochloride, Figure 1, right) forms upon addition of 1. Following complete addition of 1, the reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 5 min. The ice bath is removed, and the heterogeneous solution is stirred for 3 h at room temperature.\nFigure 1. Reaction setup for synthesis of 2\nUpon confirmation that the reaction is complete by crude 1H NMR, the stirring is stopped, and the solids are allowed to settle (Figure 2) (Note 8). The reaction mixture is decanted from the solid pyridinium hydrochloride and transferred to a 1000 mL separatory funnel (Note 9). The white pyridinium salt is washed with pentane (100 mL) to assist in transferring all the product to the funnel. The separatory funnel is charged with deionized H2O (250 mL). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 125 mL).

The flask is equipped with a septum-sealed 25.5 cm reflux condenser (with a nitrogen line inlet). The flask is then placed in a mineral oil bath and heated to reflux (Note 16) for 16 h (Figure 5). After briefly cooling the flask, a crude sample is assessed by 1H NMR and judged to be incomplete at this time (Notes 17 and 18). The reaction is restarted by first removing the solvent from the flask by rotary evaporation (Notes 19 and 20) yielding a sticky, voluminous, off-pink solid. The flask is recharged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (50 mL), and then sonicated for 5 min at 27 \u00b0C in a water bath to separate the solid from the walls of the flask. The flask is resealed with a rubber septum and flushed with nitrogen via a nitrogen line inlet. The flask is then recharged with anhydrous diisopropylamine (4.20 mL, 3.04 g, 30.0 mmol, 0.6 equiv).

            "A. Pyrazinamide (1). A glass column reactor (Note 1) is packed with Celite (100 mg, Note 2) at the bottom end of the column, amorphous manganese dioxide (3.0 g, Note 3) in the middle section of the column, and Celite (100 mg) at the top end of the column (Note 4). The glass column reactor is mounted vertically in a heating jacket (Note 5) and connected to a pumping system flowing from the bottom to the top of the reactor column (Figure 1a) (Note 6). Polyfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing (1/16\" OD x 0.040\" (1.0mm) ID) is used to connect the feed source to the pump and to connect the pump to the bottom inlet of the reactor column. Wider bore PFA tubing (1/8\" OD x 0.062\" (1.55 mm) ID) is used to connect the top outlet of the reactor tube to the product collection vessel (Note 7). The reactor column containing the manganese dioxide catalyst is equilibrated by flowing solvent, H2O/ iPrOH (10:1 v/v), through the column at 1.6 mL/min at room temperature until the back pressure reaches a steady value (Note 8). The temperature of the column is then increased to 98 \u00b0C while continuing to flow H2O/ iPrOH (10:1 v/v) solvent through the reactor column at 1.6 mL/min. A 0.5 M solution of pyrazinecarbonitrile (2) (50.0 g, 476 mmol, Note 9) in H2O/iPrOH (10:1 v/v, 910 mL) is charged to a feed source bottle (Note 10).\nFigure 1. (a) Cartridge that contains the MnO2, (b) Uniqsis flow system in operation\nOnce the reactor column has equilibrated to a stable pressure (Note 11) and temperature of 98 \u00b0C the input to the pump is switched from solvent to the pyrazinecarbonitrile solution, and the pyrazinecarbonitrile solution is fed through the reactor at 1.6 mL/min while maintaining a reactor temperature of 98 \u00b0C (Figure 1b). The reactor output is collected in a clean vessel (Note 12) where pyrazinamide (1) precipitates as white solid. Once the entire pyrazinecarbonitrile solution is fed through the reactor (9.5 h), 20 mL of solvent, H2O/ iPrOH (10:1 v/v) is passed through the reactor at 98 \u00b0C and 1.6 mL/min. The combined effluent from flowing the pyrazinecarbonitrile solution and the subsequent H2O/ iPrOH (10:1 v/v) solvent wash is allowed to crystallize by standing 14 h at 5 \u00b0C (Note 13). The solid precipitate is filtered and dried in vacuo to furnish 56.2 g (97%) of pyrazinamide (1) as a fine white powder (Notes 14, 15 and 16) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

The flask is fitted with a rubber septum, nitrogen inlet (Note 3), and thermocouple. The flask is placed in an ambient temperature water bath (22-23 \u00baC) and the stir rate is set to 700-900 rpm. Silver (II) fluoride (19.7 g, 135 mmol, 3.00 equiv) is weighed into a glass vial (Note 4), then charged in one portion to the reaction flask. The reaction mixture is aged at ambient temperature (Note 5) and monitored for conversion by TLC (Note 6). During the course of the reaction, the black AgF2 is consumed as yellow AgF is formed (Figure 1). After 90 min the reaction is deemed complete, and the reaction mixture containing insoluble silver salts is filtered over Celite (50 g, wetted with MeCN) in a 500-mL disposable filter funnel, rinsing once with MeCN (100 mL).

The flask is removed from the ice bath, allowed to warm to room temperature over 5 min, and lowered into an oil bath preheated to 100 \u00b0C. In a separate flask, 3-(((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)methyl)penta-3,4-dien-1-yl methanesulfonate (2), (7.07 g, 16.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) prepared using Org. Synth., 2017, 94, 109-122, is dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL), and this solution is added to the reaction flask in one portion using a syringe. The reaction is stirred at this temperature for 50 min (Note 8). The flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel using diethyl ether (20 mL) to rinse the flask. The mixture is washed with saturated NH4Cl (1 x 100 mL), saturated NaHCO3 (1 x 100 mL), and brine (1 x 100 mL). The organic layer is dried over MgSO4 and concentrated via rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg). The resulting residue is purified via silica gel column chromatography (Note 9) to afford 3 as a pale yellow oil (8.11 g, 89%)(Note 10).",

A 1-L, two-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a Teflon-coated, 4 cm, elliptical stir bar, a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet needle, and a septum (Note 1). The flask is charged with rhodium biscarbonyl chloride dimer ([Rh(CO)2Cl]2) (41.8 mg, 0.1 mmol, 1 mol %) and toluene (350 mL) (Note 11). The flask is evacuated via a needle pierced through the condenser septum that is connected to the vacuum line. After a few seconds the needle is removed and the septum is pierced with a CO-filled balloon and the flask is filled with carbon monoxide (Note 12). This evacuation/CO fill step is repeated three times and the flask is lowered into an oil bath preheated to 110 \u00b0C. In a 20-mL, scintillation vial, allene-yne 3 (6.00 g, 10.8 mmol, 1 equiv) is dissolved in toluene (10 mL). The allene-yne solution is added dropwise to the reaction flask over 2 h via syringe pump addition using a 20-mL plastic syringe (Figure 1). An additional portion of toluene (10 mL) is used to rinse the syringe and render the transfer quantitative. After the addition is complete, the reaction is stirred for an additional 15 min (Note 12). The flask is removed from the oil bath and the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The condenser is removed and polymer-bound triphenylphosphine (3.66 g, ~3 mmol/g, 11.0 mmol) is added all at once. A septum is placed on the flask and the suspension is stirred at room temperature as a closed system for 16 h. The mixture is filtered through a 250-mL, medium-porosity glass fritted filter into a 1-L, recovery flask and concentrated via rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg). The resulting residue is purified via silica gel flash column chromatography (Note 13) to afford 4 as a white foam (5.53 g, 88%)(Note 14).\nFigure 1. Apparatus Set-up for Step C"

To a 100 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask (left neck with a nitrogen inlet, middle with a 20 cm reflux condenser with an outlet leading to a bubbler, and right with a thermometer) is added a 2 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (3.26 g, 11.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv), l-tert-leucine (1.55 g, 11.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 1) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (30 mL) (Note 2). The resulting brownish suspension is added to a preheated 160 \u00b0C oil bath, stirred (2000 rpm) at reflux (145-149 \u00b0C internal) for 2 h under continuous nitrogen atmosphere (Notes 3 and 4) (Figure 1). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature (Figure 2) and DMF is removed by short path distillation with the aid of high vacuum (80 \u00b0C oil bath, 100 to 80 mbar vacuum) (Note 5) until a brown-orange oil is obtained (Figure 3).\nFigure 1. Glassware assembly for Step A\nFigure 2. Reaction appearance before (left) and after (right) heating(photo provided by Authors, who performed the reaction in a one-necked flask)\nFigure 3. Crude brown oil after removal of DMF\nThis residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (150 mL) and transferred into a 500 mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with distilled H2O (3 x 150 mL) (Note 6), and a saturated aqueous NaCl solution (150 mL). The aqueous layers are combined, and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 75 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (8-10 g) and filtered into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. The sodium sulfate is washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 15 mL) into the round-bottomed flask, and the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (250 to 120 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to yield a brown solid (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Crude N-4-Bromo-1,8-naphtaloyl-(S)-tert-leucine prior to chromatography\nA dry pack of the crude product (Note 7) is charged on a column of silica gel (130 g) (Notes 8 and 9) and eluted with a mixture of ethyl acetate/hexanes (3:7) with 1% formic acid (Note 10). Fractions (25 mL fraction) of desired carboxylic acid are collected (Notes 11 and 12), combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation (275 to 120 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to afford a yellow solid (3.72 g). The product is transferred into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask. Dichloromethane (25 mL) and methanol (0.5 mL) are added. The resulting yellow mixture is heated at reflux until complete dissolution and then cooled to room temperature. The flask is then stored at 0-4 \u00b0C overnight to form pale yellow crystals. The crystals are filtered through filter paper with a 6.5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel by suction, and then washed with hexanes (15 mL) to yield 1.48 g of the desired product. The mother liquors are collected, concentrated and two additional recrystallizations and one precipitation processes are achieved (Notes 13 and 14) (Figure 5). The pale yellow solid is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg, rt) for 16 h, affording a total of 3.35 g (8.61 mmol, 73% yield) of the desired product (Notes 15, 16, and 17).\nFigure 5.

A 100 mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask (left neck with a nitrogen inlet, middle neck with a Soxhlet extractor (Note 18) attached to a bubbler, and the left with a thermometer) is equipped with a 2 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (Note 19). The flask is charged with rhodium (II) acetate (0.570 g, 1.28 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 20), N-4-Bromo-1,8-naphthaloyl-(S)-tert-leucine (1) (3.00 g, 7.69 mmol, 6.00 equiv) and chlorobenzene (50 mL, 0.03 M) (Note 21).\nThe extractor body is filled with an oven-dried mixture of potassium carbonate (2 g) and sand (1 g) (Notes 22 and 23). The resulting mixture is stirred (2000 rpm) and heated at reflux under a continuous flow of nitrogen for 16 h (Notes 24 and 25) (Figure 6). The reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 26).\nFigure 6. Glassware assembly for Step A\nThe reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature, and the thermometer and the nitrogen inlet are replaced with glass stoppers. The chlorobenzene is removed by a short path distillation (Note 27), affording a dark green solid. The residue is dissolved in a minimum volume of diethyl ether (4-5 mL, Et2O), which is then filtered through a pad of basic alumina (140 g) (Notes 28 and 29) to remove residual carboxylic acid and dark impurities, eluting with Et2O (Note 30) (Figure 7).\nFigure 7. Initiation (left) and completion (right) of filtration on alumina\nThe filtrate is collected in 25 mL fractions and then transferred into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. The green filtrate is evaporated to dryness using a 40 \u00b0C water bath, with the eventual application of a slight vacuum (650 mmHg). To the green solid is added diethyl ether (10 mL) and pentane (100 mL). The mixture is then gently shaken by hand until a mint green precipitate formed. The green precipitate is vacuum filtered through a filter paper using a 6.5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel (Figure 8).\nFigure 8.

The green solid is carefully collected, affording 1.47 g of the desired catalyst. The mother liquors are collected into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask (Note 31), concentrated to dryness and the precipitation process is repeated (Note 32). The solids are combined and dried under high vacuum (0.5 mm Hg) at room temperature for 24 h (Note 33), affording a total of 2.26 g (1.26 mmol, 95% yield) of a pale green powder (Notes 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38)."

            "Buta-2,3-dien-1-ol. A 2-L oven-dried, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 30-cm reflux condenser (open to the air), two septa, and a thermocouple (Note 1), and the flask is placed in a heating mantle. To this flask are added CuI (38.1 g, 0.20 mol, 0.5 equiv), paraformaldehyde (20.5 g, 0.64 mol, 1.6 equiv), and THF (800 mL), and stirring with the mechanical stirrer is initiated. Diisopropylamine (56.7 g, 78.5 mL, 0.56 mol, 1.4 equiv) is added in one portion by graduated cylinder, followed by the addition of propargyl alcohol (22.5 g, 23.4 mL, 0.40 mol, 1.0 equiv) by syringe (Notes 2, 3 and 4). The mixture turns from a greenish suspension to a yellow suspension when the propargyl alcohol is added. The mixture initially became thicker, and a rapid exotherm from 21 \u00b0C to 27 \u00b0C is observed, and an orange suspension is present (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Appearance of Reaction at the Initiation of Reflux\nAfter the addition of the propargyl alcohol, the resulting mixture is heated to reflux (66 \u00b0C) for 24 h in a heating mantle without protection with an inert atmosphere (Notes 5 and 6) (Figures 1 and 2). After being allowed to cool to room temperature, the dark-brown solution is transferred to a 3-L flask and the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (water bath: 20 \u00b0C/75 mmHg) (Note 7).\nFigure 2. Reaction after 24 h under Reflux\nThe original 2-L flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and thermocouple, charged with a cold solution (2 \u00b0C) of diethyl ether (500 mL) and 12 N HCl (50 mL), and agitation is started. The stirring solution is cooled to ca. -10 \u00b0C in a salt/ice bath, at which time the concentrated solution, which has a mass of ca. 185 g, is slowly and cautiously poured into the cold acidic mixture in five portions approximately 3 minutes apart (Note 8). The immediate formation of a thick, dark brown, oily precipitate and an exotherm to a maximum of 4.0 \u00b0C are observed. Agitation is stopped and the mixture is allowed to settle for 5 min. The supernatant yellow solution is carefully decanted onto a short column of silica gel (50 g) in a 150-mL medium-fritted filter funnel positioned above a 1-L filtration flask (Notes 9 and 10). A vacuum is applied briefly to move the solution through the silica gel (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Yellow Solution after Initial Filtration\nTo the reddish-brown residue in the 2-L flask is added diethyl ether (100 mL), mechanical stirring is used for 3 min, and the solution is allowed to settle for 3 min. The supernatant liquid is carefully decanted onto the same short silica gel column and filtered through the silica gel pad by briefly applying vacuum. The ether extraction (100 mL), settling, decantation and filtration process is repeated twice more (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Silica Gel Pad after all Filtrations\nThe clear, light yellow filtrate (~ 850 mL) is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with saturated NaCl (2 x 100 mL). The aq. phases are combined and then back-extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 100 mL). All organic phases are combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (40 g), and filtered into 2-L flask with a 45/50 center joint. The solution is concentrated using a rotary evaporator (20 \u00b0C/65 mmHg), which facilitated the removal of ca. 820 mL of clear, colorless distillate. The residual yellow solution is transferred to a 250 mL flask, using ~ 50 mL MTBE to quantitatively transfer the mixture, and further concentrated in vacuo (20 \u00b0C/65 mmHg) to provide 23.5 g of a crude yellow oil (Note 11).\nA short path distillation head is attached and the 10 mL receiving flask is chilled to -78 \u00b0C. The flask is immersed in an oil bath, and distillation is initiated at 25 \u00b0C (65 mmHg). A forerun of 2.0 mL is collected at 45 \u00b0C, at which point the distillation temperature dropped and distillation of the forerun stopped. A 25 mL receiver flask is then installed and chilled to -78 \u00b0C, and the distillation re-started. With the pot temperature at 65 \u00b0C, the main fraction (12.5 g, 45%, 98% purity) is collected (55 \u00b0C/30-33 mmHg) as a colorless oil (Note 12)."

            "A. Cedrol lithium oxalate (2). A 100 mL one-necked (24/40 joint) round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (oval, 25 mm x 10 mm) is charged with cedrol (1) (2.22 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 1), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (1.34 g, 11.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 2), and dichloromethane (40 mL) (Note 3). The flask, which is open to air, is immersed in a room temperature water bath, and the mixture is rapidly stirred under ambient atmosphere. A disposable plastic syringe is used to add methyl chlorooxoacetate (960 \u00b5L, 10.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 4) drop-wise over the course of 2 min (Note 5). The resulting pale yellow solution is maintained for 2 h at room temperature (Figure 1). A fritted glass funnel (6 cm diameter x 10 cm height) with a vacuum adapter is packed with 35 g of silica gel (Note 6) as a slurry in dichloromethane. The crude reaction mixture is poured onto the silica gel plug (Figure 1). A mild vacuum (~10 mmHg) is applied, and the filtrate is collected. The 100 mL round-bottomed flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 x 10 mL), and the washings are also poured onto the silica gel plug. The silica gel plug is washed with additional dichloromethane (4 x 50 mL), and the combined organic washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (23 \u00baC, 12 mmHg) in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask to yield the crude methyl oxalate as a clear oil (2.85-3.00 g).\nFigure 1. Left: reaction turns pale yellow following the addition of methyl chlorooxoacetate; Right: reaction mixture is filtered over the silica gel plug\nThis crude product is dissolved in 10 mL of THF (Note 7) and transferred from the 500 mL round-bottomed flask to a 250 mL separatory funnel. The 500 mL round-bottomed flask is rinsed with an additional 10 mL of THF, and the washings are added to the separatory funnel. An aqueous solution of 0.5 M LiOH (18 mL, 9.0 mmol, 0.90 equiv) (Note 8) is added to the organic layer. The separatory funnel is briefly shaken to ensure efficient mixing, then the homogenous solution is allowed to stand for 5 min. Hexanes (60 mL) (Note 9) are then added, and the mixture is shaken. The phases are allowed to separate (Note 10), then the aqueous phase is collected in a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The organic layer is washed with a second portion of deionized water (20 mL), and the combined aqueous phases are concentrated under reduced pressure (12 mmHg, water was removed by distillation as an azeotrope with three 100 mL portions of toluene at 23 \u00baC) (Note 11). The resulting solid is then dried on a vacuum manifold (0.2 mmHg, 23 \u00baC) overnight to yield the desired product 2 as a colorless solid (2.56 g, 85% yield, 98% purity) (Note 12).\nB. Cedrol benzyl acrylate addition product (3). On the bench under ambient atmosphere, six 8-mL scintillation vials (Note 13), each equipped with a magnetic stir bar (oval, 12 mm x 2 mm), are charged with benzyl acrylate (97 mg, 0.60 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 14), cedrol lithium oxalate 2 (198 mg, 0.660 mmol, 1.1 equiv), and [Ir{dF(CF3 )ppy}2(dtbbpy)]PF6 (7 mg, 0.006 mmol, 0.01 equiv) (Note 15). A 3:1 mixture of dimethoxy-ethane/dimethylformamide (6 mL, 0.1 M) (Note 16) is added, followed by deionized water (110 \u00b5L, 6.0 mmol, 10 equiv) (Note 17), (Note 18). The vials are then sealed with screw caps bearing Teflon septa. Each septum of the sealed vials is pierced with a 21 gauge x 1.5'' needle that is inserted just barely through the septum with the tip of the needle kept above the fluid level inside the vial (Figure 2). A separate 21 gauge x 3'' needle attached to a flow of argon is also pierced through the septum, and the tip of the needle is pushed to the bottom of the vial and submersed in the fluid. The reaction mixtures are deoxygenated by sparging with argon for 15 min (Note 19).\nBoth needles are removed, and the sealed vials are then placed on a stir plate equipped with 2 x 34 W blue LED lamps (Notes 20 and 21) and a rack to hold the vials inside of a cardboard box to block light pollution from entering the lab (Figure 3). The vials are placed in two parallel rows of 3 vials approximately 4 cm from the lamps and stirred vigorously. The samples are irradiated by the lamps for 24 h inside the closed box, and the air inside the box rises to 40-45 \u00baC because of heat given off from the LEDs (Notes 22, 23, and 24).\nFigure 2. Left: reaction mixture is being sparged with argon. Right: reaction mixture before (right) and after (left) being sparged with argon\nThe reactions are allowed to cool to rt, then all six are opened and poured into the same 500 mL separatory funnel. The vials are each rinsed with 5 mL of diethyl ether, and the washings are also added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is further diluted with 200 mL of additional diethyl ether. The organic solution is washed with an aqueous mixture of 2:1 saturated aqueous LiCl/deionized water (150 mL) (Note 25). The layers are separated and the organic phase is washed with deionized water (100 mL). The combined aqueous phases are extracted again with fresh diethyl ether (100 mL). The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with deionized water (100 mL). The combined ethereal extracts are dried with MgSO4 (s) (4 g). The mixture is vacuum filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5 cm OD x 6 cm height), and the solids washed with diethyl ether (2 x 30 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg). The crude material is charged on a column (3 cm OD x 12.5 cm height) of 45 g of silica gel (Note 26) and eluted with 500 mL of 98:2 hexanes/Et2O solvent mixture. The eluent is collected over 25 fractions, with the desired product obtained in fractions 13-22 (Note 27). The fractions containing the product are concentrated under reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg) to give the desired product 3 as a yellow oil (1.04 g, 78% yield, 99% purity) (Notes 28, 29, and 30).\nFigure 3. Visible light reaction set-up\n2. Notes\n1. Cedrol (98%) was purchased from TCI America and used as received. \"Redistilled Cedrol\" is commercially available in cheap, bulk quantities, but the purity (~60%) is not sufficient for these studies.\n2. DMAP (99%) was purchased from Oakwood Chemical and used as received.\n3. Dichloromethane (99.9%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company and used as received.\n4. Methyl chlorooxoacetate was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. The batch used by the submitters was from a bottle without an air-free septum and was used periodically over the course of a year before being used in the reported procedure.\n5. The reaction is mildly exothermic. A clear, pale yellow homogeneous solution is observed after addition of all reagents.\n6. Geduran Si 60 (40-63 mm) silica gel was purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation.\n7. Tetrahydrofuran (99.9%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company and used as received.\n8. LiOH monohydrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The salt is dissolved in deionized water to form a stock solution. The stock solution was titrated with 1 N HCl (aq) using phenolphthalein as an indicator to determine the exact concentration of this stock solution. More than 0.9 equiv LiOH (aq) can be judiciously used to consume all of the methyl oxalate, but adding too much is detrimental to the purity of the product. The use of other alkali hydroxides is possible, and the resulting oxalates couple with similar efficiency.2 In general, lithium and cesium oxalates have the most favorable physical properties (i.e., non-hygroscopic, non-deliquescent, and stable solid compounds) and perform well in the photoredox-catalyzed coupling reaction.\n9. Hexanes (98.5%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company and used as received.\n10. The lithium oxalate is not completely soluble in the aqueous phase because of the large hydrophobic backbone of cedrol, so some insoluble product is observed at the interface of the layers. The second aqueous extraction dissolves this insoluble material. This poor solubility is not generally observed for lithium oxalates derived from other alcohols, but is in fact specific to cedrol.\n11. The use of a 1 L round bottom is highly recommended, as the mixture tends to bump during concentration. It is also advised to dry the sample on the rotary evaporator for at least an hour to remove as much water as possible before placing it under high vacuum. After drying, the material can either be scraped out of the vessel or transferred to a smaller vessel by dissolving in methanol. It is important to thoroughly dry the salt under high vacuum to remove all methanol before use.\n12. A reaction performed on half scale provided 1.27 g (85%) of product2pdf.

The 8-mL vials (Kimble Glass Screw-Thread Sample Vials with PTFE/Silicone Septa and Open-Top Polypropylene Closure, 60942A8) were purchased from Fisher Scientific Company. The dimensions of the reaction vessel are important for maximizing surface area exposed to the light source.\n14. Benzyl acrylate was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Commercial Michael acceptors often contain ppm concentration of various radical inhibitors that are generally not detrimental to the reaction. This is consistent with the proposed photoredox mechanism that does not involve radical chain reactions.\n15. [Ir{dF(CF3)ppy}2(dtbbpy)]PF6 may be purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Strem Chemicals in high purity. The complex can alternatively be synthesized for a fraction of the price.8a An Organic Syntheses procedure is also available for the preparation of [Ir{dF(CF3)ppy}2(dtbbpy)]PF6.8b\n16. Dimethoxyethane (99%) and dimethylformamide (99.8%) were purchased from Fisher Scientific Company and used as received.\n17. The addition of deionized water is highly beneficial. Presumably, the water both assists in solubilizing the oxalate salt and provides a proton source to quench the intermediate lithium enolate after radical coupling and reduction. The exact equiv of water used is an important but is not an absolutely critical variable. A diminished isolated yield (59%) was obtained for a reaction run with 50 equiv of water, which corresponds to a reaction solution that is roughly 10% water by volume. As a corollary, the use of rigorously dried solvents and flame-dried glassware is generally not necessary.\n18. It is important to add the deionized water last. If the water is added to the oxalate before the other solvents, a gel may form that impedes stirring in the reactions.\n19. The reaction is moderately air sensitive. A 46% 1H NMR yield was observed when the reaction was run under an air atmosphere with no attempt to deoxygenate the reaction mixture at all.\n20. If a standard 20 W CFL bulb is used in place of the 34 W blue LED, a 41% 1H NMR yield is observed after 24 h. Blue LED lamps were purchased from Kessil on Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com/Kessil-KSH150B-Grow-Light-Blue/dp/B004GB441K). During the course of our studies, the Kessil KSH150B lamps became unavailable. Ostensibly equivalent Kessil models A160WE and Kessil H150W can be purchased on Amazon.com ( http://www.amazon.com/Kessil-A160WE-Controllable-Aquarium-Light/dp/B00QHC6D7O , http://www.amazon.com/Kessil-Angle-Light-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00598HIEO) . The Checkers used two Kessil A160WE \"Tuna Blue\" lamps described above at the full blue setting.\n21. Blue light from high-intensity LEDs can be damaging to eyesight. It is important that the reaction setup be surrounded by an appropriate shield to protect researchers from exposure to the light from the LED lamps. Researchers should wear blue-light blocking safety glasses when the lamps are in operation. The Submitters used Uvex Skyper Blue Computer Blocking Glasses (model #: S1933X).\n22. The temperature of the reaction mixture after 24 h was measured by the use of a thermocouple to be 62 \u00baC, which is roughly 20 \u00baC warmer than the ambient air inside the cardboard box.\n23. The increased temperature is generally beneficial to the reaction provided that the Michael acceptor is not particularly sensitive. If the reactions are cooled to rt by blowing a stream of rt air over them during irradiation, a 71% yield is observed by 1H NMR after 24 h.\n24. As the rate of the reaction is proportional to the amount of light exposure, it is important that each vial has maximum exposure to the light source. The reactions turn brown-black within 5 minutes, then become greenish-brown after 24 h. The lithium oxalate is not completely soluble in the reaction mixture and may collect near the surface of the solution. It is helpful to briefly shake the vials once or twice during the 24 h course of the reaction to dislodge this material; all of this material should be dissolved to ensure complete reaction and to allow maximum light flux into solution. The low solubility of the lithium oxalate is not a general feature of lithium oxalates and seems unique to the cedrol-based lithium oxalate 2.\n25. The purpose of the aqueous LiCl wash is to remove traces of DMF from the product. There are some solids at the interface between the phases during the LiCl (aq) wash. These dissolve during the subsequent wash with deionized water.\n26. Geduran Si 60 (40-63 mm) silica gel was purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation.\n27.

Trace amounts of benzyl acrylate may be present in the sample. The impurity can be removed via concentration on a vacuum manifold (0.2 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) overnight.\n30.

Discussion\nThe reported method, which was developed in collaboration with the MacMillan group, allows for redox-neutral construction of quaternary carbon stereocenters by the coupling of tertiary radicals, generated from tertiary alcohol-derived oxalate salts, with electron-deficient alkenes under visible-light photoredox catalysis.2 The most common alternative to the reported method for the generation of tertiary alkyl radicals from tertiary alcohols is the use of Barton's alkyl N -hydroxypyridine-2-thionyl oxalates.3 While useful for primary and secondary alcohols, Barton oxalate derivatives of tertiary alcohols are fairly unstable, which prevents their isolation, and their light sensitivity makes their use challenging. Inspired by this Barton chemistry, the Overman group described the use of tert-alkyl N -phthalimidoyl oxalates as precursors of tertiary radicals.4 These radical precursors are relatively stable to visible light and can be stored at -20 \u00baC in a freezer indefinitely. However, the N -phthalimidoyl oxalate moiety presents complications during purification, resulting in decomposition upon silica gel chromatography or aqueous extraction. Other synthetically useful methods for generation of tertiary radicals utilize precursor functional groups such as alkenes,5 carboxylic acids,6 or N-(acyloxy)phthalimides.7\nIn the example detailed here, a commercially available, sterically congested tertiary alcohol, cedrol 1, is coupled to a prototypical Michael acceptor, benzyl acrylate, to illustrate the efficiency and diastereoselective nature of the reaction in a complex setting. The resulting product is obtained as a single epimer at the newly formed quaternary carbon stereocenter in good yield using nearly equimolar amounts of the two coupling partners. The conditions reported are general and expected to be similarly efficient for a wide scope of coupling partners.\nAs shown in Scheme 1, the proposed mechanism of the coupling reaction involves irradiation of the heteroleptic photocatalyst Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6 (4) [dF(CF3)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridine, dtbbpy = 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine] with visible light to generate a long-lived (t = 2.3 ms) excited state *IrIII 5, which is a strong oxidant (E1/2red [*IrIII/IrII] = +1.21 V vs. SCE in CH3CN)8 capable of oxidizing cedrol lithium oxalate 2 ( E1/2red = +1.28 V vs. SCE in CH3CN for t-BuOCOCO2Cs)2 via single-electron transfer (SET). After oxidation, the oxalate radical spontaneously extrudes two molecules of CO2 in a stepwise fashion to form the tertiary alkyl radical 6. This nucleophilic carbon-centered radical 6 reacts with the electron-deficient alkene benzyl acrylate. Finally, the reduction of the resulting adduct radical 7 (E1/2 red = \u22120.59 to \u22120.73 V vs. SCE in MeCN)9 by SET from the available IrII species 8 (E 1/2red [IrIII/IrII] = -1.37 V vs. SCE in CH3CN)8 followed by protonation yields coupled product 3 and regenerates ground state photocatalyst 4.\nThe addition of a nucleophilic tertiary carbon radicals to a p-bond has an early transition state and consequently a relatively long bond (~2.5 \u00c5),10 which reduces the enthalpic penalty incurred from steric strain as bulky fragments approach one another. As a result, the generation of sterically encumbered quaternary carbons is often facile and proceeds under mild conditions.12 The efficiency and scope of the coupling procedure described in this procedure is illustrated by the selection of published examples grouped in (Table 1).2 Steric bulk in the vicinity of the forming quaternary carbon is well tolerated, with adjacent isopropyl and tert-butyl groups not greatly reducing the efficiency of the reaction.\nAdditionally, stereoselection in the addition of tertiary radicals to alkenes can be quite large, as evinced by the high diastereoselectivity observed for the formation of quaternary stereocenters of coupled products 12-14 (Table 1).2 The stereoselective nature of these reactions is somewhat surprising given the aforementioned long (~2.5 \u00c5) forming bond in the transition state, which might be expected to translate to poor stereochemical control. Nevertheless, tertiary radicals are indeed large enough to impose significantly differentiated amounts of strain in diastereotopic transition states leading to excellent levels of stereoselectivity.\nScheme 1. Proposed mechanism for visible light photoredox-catalyzed coupling reaction\nTable 1. Previously published examples of visible light photoredox catalyzed coupling reaction\nFinally, it is important to note that this visible-light photoredox catalyzed radical reaction proceeds with good efficiency in an intermolecular reaction utilizing nearly 1:1 stoichiometry of the coupling partners. The advantage of this feature is that it enables the union of complex fragments in the context of total synthesis, wherein it is not feasible to use a precious, complex intermediate in large excess. References 2 and 13 detail examples of utilizing this complex fragment coupling reaction to enable efficient total synthesis of trans -clerodane natural products. Two recent publications describe a one-pot procedure for transforming secondary and tertiary alcohols to oxalate salts and employing them directly in visible-light photoredox coupling with carbon electrophiles.14",
            "B. Cedrol benzyl acrylate addition product (3). On the bench under ambient atmosphere, six 8-mL scintillation vials (Note 13), each equipped with a magnetic stir bar (oval, 12 mm x 2 mm), are charged with benzyl acrylate (97 mg, 0.60 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 14), cedrol lithium oxalate 2 (198 mg, 0.660 mmol, 1.1 equiv), and [Ir{dF(CF3 )ppy}2(dtbbpy)]PF6 (7 mg, 0.006 mmol, 0.01 equiv) (Note 15). A 3:1 mixture of dimethoxy-ethane/dimethylformamide (6 mL, 0.1 M) (Note 16) is added, followed by deionized water (110 \u00b5L, 6.0 mmol, 10 equiv) (Note 17), (Note 18). The vials are then sealed with screw caps bearing Teflon septa. Each septum of the sealed vials is pierced with a 21 gauge x 1.5'' needle that is inserted just barely through the septum with the tip of the needle kept above the fluid level inside the vial (Figure 2). A separate 21 gauge x 3'' needle attached to a flow of argon is also pierced through the septum, and the tip of the needle is pushed to the bottom of the vial and submersed in the fluid. The reaction mixtures are deoxygenated by sparging with argon for 15 min (Note 19).\nBoth needles are removed, and the sealed vials are then placed on a stir plate equipped with 2 x 34 W blue LED lamps (Notes 20 and 21) and a rack to hold the vials inside of a cardboard box to block light pollution from entering the lab (Figure 3). The vials are placed in two parallel rows of 3 vials approximately 4 cm from the lamps and stirred vigorously. The samples are irradiated by the lamps for 24 h inside the closed box, and the air inside the box rises to 40-45 \u00baC because of heat given off from the LEDs (Notes 22, 23, and 24).\nFigure 2. Left: reaction mixture is being sparged with argon. Right: reaction mixture before (right) and after (left) being sparged with argon\nThe reactions are allowed to cool to rt, then all six are opened and poured into the same 500 mL separatory funnel. The vials are each rinsed with 5 mL of diethyl ether, and the washings are also added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is further diluted with 200 mL of additional diethyl ether. The organic solution is washed with an aqueous mixture of 2:1 saturated aqueous LiCl/deionized water (150 mL) (Note 25). The layers are separated and the organic phase is washed with deionized water (100 mL). The combined aqueous phases are extracted again with fresh diethyl ether (100 mL). The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with deionized water (100 mL). The combined ethereal extracts are dried with MgSO4 (s) (4 g). The mixture is vacuum filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5 cm OD x 6 cm height), and the solids washed with diethyl ether (2 x 30 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg). The crude material is charged on a column (3 cm OD x 12.5 cm height) of 45 g of silica gel (Note 26) and eluted with 500 mL of 98:2 hexanes/Et2O solvent mixture. The eluent is collected over 25 fractions, with the desired product obtained in fractions 13-22 (Note 27). The fractions containing the product are concentrated under reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg) to give the desired product 3 as a yellow oil (1.04 g, 78% yield, 99% purity) (Notes 28, 29, and 30).\nFigure 3.

A 1-L conical flask open to the atmosphere is equipped with a large Teflon-coated, octagonal shaped stir bar (51 \u00d7 8 mm) then charged with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (20.0 g, 205 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2), ice (100 g) and sat aq NaHCO3 (100 mL) (Figure 1). The reaction vessel is stirred vigorously and maintained at 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath, then treated with N,N\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (5.4 g) in 8 portions over 15 min (43.2 g, 267 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Notes 3 and 4).\nFigure 1.

The combined organic phases are washed with brine (1 \u00d7 50 mL), transferred to a 500-mL conical flask, and then dried over Na2SO4 (22 g) for 10 min. The solution is vacuum filtered, using a cotton wool plug in a glass funnel, into a tared 250-mL round-bottomed flask with a stir bar of known mass. The solution is then concentrated under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 430 mmHg, rotary evaporation). The resulting pale-yellow colored oil is stirred vigorously under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg, 19 \u00baC, 6 h) to remove traces of DCM, which yields N-methoxy-N-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-carboxamide (1) (29.4-30.0 g, 92-94% yield at 97.5% purity) as a lemon-gold colored oil that is used without further purification (Notes 6 and 7).",

A flame-dried 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a teflon-coated, egg-shaped stir bar (10 \u00d7 19 mm) is fitted with 25-mL pressure-equalizing dropping addition funnel. A glass gas inlet adapter is placed on the top of the addition funnel and connected to a nitrogen-vacuum double manifold (Figure 2). The flask is charged with N-methoxy-N-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-carboxamide (1, 15.5 g, 100 mmol), placed under vacuum (1 mmHg), and backfilled with nitrogen three times. The reaction vessel is cooled to 0 \u00b0C and the pressure-equalizing dropping addition funnel is charged with trimethylsilyl cyanide (13.1 mL, 105 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 8). Trimethylsilyl cyanide is then added to the flask dropwise over 5 min. When the addition is complete the ice bath is removed, allowing the reaction vessel to warm to room temperature (19 \u00b0C), and stirring is continued at this temperature for 24 h. After 24 h, the red-orange reaction mixture is diluted with DCM (50 mL), equipped with a plastic cap, and cooled to 0 \u00b0C in a water and ice bath for 5 min. The mixture is then poured into a 500-mL separatory funnel containing sat aq NaHCO3 (50 mL), ice (50 g) and brine (30 mL). The organic layer is removed after being washed with this mixture and the resulting aqueous layer is again extracted with DCM (5 \u00d7 20 mL) (Note 5). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (1 \u00d7 40 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (22 g).

To a flame dried 500 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a 40 x 20 mm oval-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a dried 100 mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a thermometer adaptor fitted with an internal thermometer is added 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzonitrile (25.0 g, 168 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) followed by 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (19.8 g, 176 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 3). The remaining neck is sealed with a rubber septum. The system is flushed with nitrogen using a double Schlenk manifold (nitrogen and vacuum) and charged with DMF (100 mL) (Note 4) via syringe. The resultant slurry is warmed to an internal temperature of 50 \u00b0C in an oil bath (Note 5) during which time it became a homogenous brown solution. In the interim, dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride (20.7 g, 168 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6) is charged to a 100 mL single-necked round-bottomed flask that had been capped with a rubber septum, flame dried, and evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen three times. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 30 mL) (Note 4) is added via syringe and the flask gently swirled until all of the dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride had dissolved, at which point the solution is transferred to the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel via syringe. The solution of dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over a period of 10 min resulting in a 12 \u00b0C exotherm and a turbid reaction mixture (Note 7). The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 4 h at 50 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature and water (2 x 75 mL) (Note 8) is added via the dropping funnel. After approximately 20-30 mL of water had been added, the reaction mixture became homogenous (brown/greenish hue) (Note 9). After approximately 75 mL of water had been added, significant precipitation of the desired product is observed along with a 10 \u00b0C exotherm. After all of the water had been added, the resultant slurry is stirred for an additional 0.5 h before the product is collected by vacuum filtration onto a 100 mL sintered-glass funnel. The white crystals are washed with two portions of cold water (50 mL) and dried under high vacuum for 12 h (<1 mmHg) to give O-(4-cyano-2-methoxyphenyl) dimethylcarbamothioate (1) as white crystals (28.2 g, 71%) (Notes 10, 11, and 12).\nFigure 1.

To the slurry is added potassium hydroxide flakes (16.4 g, 292 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 22) in three portions over 30 min, an exotherm of 12 \u00b0C was observed upon addition of the first portion of potassium hydroxide. One side-arm is fitted with a septa and the other with a thermometer adaptor fitted with a thermometer. The reaction is then warmed to an internal temperature of 30 \u00b0C using a silicone oil bath and rapidly stirred (1000 rpm) for 12 h (Note 23). During the course of the reaction the slurry became a dark-colored homogeneous solution. At the end of the aforementioned time period the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a 55 x 10 mm cylindrical stir bar. Methanol (20 mL) is used to rinse the three-necked round-bottomed flask and is then added to the Erlenmeyer flask. The stirred solution is then acidified to pH 2 with 3.0 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (110 mL) (Note 24), during which a fluffy off-white precipitate forms (Note 25).

To a 500 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser on the center neck and a 40 x 20 mm oval-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged 4-mercapto-3-methoxybenzonitrile (3) (12.0 g, 72.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) followed by zirconium(IV) chloride (16.9 g, 72.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 31). One side-arm is fitted with a septa and the other with a screw-thread adaptor fitted with a thermometer. Acetonitrile (250 mL) (Note 32) is added and the reaction mixture stirred rapidly until all solids dissolve and a yellow homogenous solution is obtained (approximately 5 min) (Note 33). The reaction mixture is next cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath and hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w aqueous, 24.7 mL, 217.9 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 34) is added dropwise, maintaining the internal temperature below 10 \u00b0C (Caution! Highly exothermic) (Note 35). After the addition of the hydrogen peroxide is complete, the ice bath is removed and the yellow homogenous solution stirred for an additional 0.5 h at ambient temperature during which time a pale precipitate forms. Water (150 mL) is added and the reaction mixture stirred until all of the precipitate dissolves. This mixture is then transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel, diluted further with water (200 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (Note 36) (3 x 150 mL).

A 500 mL round-bottomed, single-necked flask equipped with a Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar is charged with saccharin (1) (18.0 g, 98.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2), followed by methanol (350 mL) (Note 3). The flask is equipped with a glass gas adapter and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1A). Vigorous stirring (750 rpm) produces a turbid suspension. The adapter is removed temporarily and tert-butyl hypochlorite (13.9 g, 128 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 2) is added in one portion to the suspension. The suspension becomes a clear solution, after which a large amount of white precipitate is formed quickly (Figure 1, B and C).\nFigure 1. A) Slurry of Saccharine (1), B) Reaction Thin Slurry, C) Slurry of Product (2), and D) Settling of Reaction Mixture\nThe mixture is stirred for 5 min and then allowed to stand without stirring for 5 min (Note 4) (Figure 1D). The precipitate is vacuum filtered using a 70 mm B\u00fcchner funnel with Whatman #1 filter paper (Note 5). The reaction flask and the cake are rinsed with petroleum ether (100 mL) (Notes 3 and 6). The solid is removed from the filter paper and is dried at ambient temperature under high vacuum (< 12 mmHg, 6 h) to afford N-chlorosaccharin (2) as a white powder (16.2-16.9 g, 76-79%) (Notes 7 and 8) (Figure 2). N-Chlorosaccharin (2) is stored in a refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) with the exclusion of moisture (Note 9).\nFigure 2. Product (2) formed in Step A",
            "B. tris-Silver (I) trifluoromethanethiolate acetonitrile solvate (3). To an oven-dried 500 mL round-bottomed, single-necked flask equipped with a stir bar is added dry silver (I) fluoride (50 g, 394.1 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 10). The flask is equipped with a gas inlet, and the system is evacuated and refilled with argon three times. The gas inlet is removed, dry acetonitrile (250 mL) (Note 3) is poured into the flask, and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser equipped with a gas inlet (Note 11). While under a positive pressure of argon the joint between the flask and reflux condenser is separated, carbon disulfide (50 mL) added by syringe (Note 12) (Figure 3), and the reflux condenser is reattached. The flask is then placed into a preheated 80 \u00b0C oil bath with efficient stirring (Note 13) and protected from the light with aluminum foil (Figure 4). After 12 h the reaction mixture became a black mixture, at which time the flask is removed from the oil bath and the contents are allowed to cool to room temperature. The reflux condenser is replaced with a distillation head and excess carbon disulfide is removed by atmospheric pressure distillation at 75 \u00b0C for 1.5 h (Note 14) (Figure 5).\nFigure 3. Addition of carbon disulfide\nFigure 4. Reflux for 12 h\nThe distillation head and magnetic stir bar are removed. The flask is transferred to a rotary evaporator and the remaining solvent is removed at 40 \u00b0C by gradually reducing the vacuum level to 30 mmHg to yield a black residue.\nFigure 5. Removing Carbon disulfide by distillation\nThe residue is re-suspended in ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL) (Notes 3 and 15) and filtered through a pad of Celite (40 g) (Note 16). The black residue on the top of the Celite cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL) (Figure 6). The flask is then wrapped in aluminum foil and the ethyl acetate is once again removed under reduced pressure with the aid of a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg) to yield a yellow oil with fine crystals suspended in it. The yellow material (Note 17) is dissolved in a minimum amount of acetonitrile (15 mL) (Notes 3 and 18) to produce a clear yellow solution. Approximately 350 mL of diethyl ether (Note 3) is carefully layered on top of the yellow solution, which becomes milky white during the addition. The flask is capped with a stopper and left at room temperature for 10 min after which it is placed in a freezer set to -20 \u00b0C for 24 h to produce an off-white or pale yellow solid. The flask is removed from the freezer and the mixture is vacuum filtered using 70 mm B\u00fcchner funnel with a Whatman #1 filter paper. A portion of mother liquor (~ 50 mL) is used to rinse the crystallization flask and transfer the remaining product to the filter.\nFigure 6. Filtration in Step B\nThe residue is dried at ambient temperature under high vacuum (< 12 mmHg, 6 h) to afford tris-silver (I) trifluoromethanethiolate (3) as an off-white solid (21.5-26.9 g, 74-92%) (Notes 19 and 20) (Figure 7). The solid is stored in a refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) with the exclusion of light.\nFigure 7. Product isolated in Step B",

A 250 mL round-bottomed, single-necked flask equipped with a Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar is charged with N-chlorosaccharin (2) (5.0 g, 23.0 mmol, 1 equiv) and tris-silver (I) trifluoromethanethiolate acetonitrile solvate (3) (6.0 g, 9.0 mmol, 0.4 equiv) followed by acetonitrile (65 mL) (Note 3). The flask is equipped with a gas inlet, and the reaction mixture stirred vigorously (Note 21) under an atmosphere of nitrogen at room temperature for 30 min. The white slurry changed to a fine light grey suspension over the reaction time. The solvent is then filtered through a pad of Celite (30 g) (Note 22) (Figure 8). The acetonitrile is evaporated under reduced pressure with the aid of a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg). The residue is mixed with dichloromethane (90 mL) (Note 3 and 23) to provide a white suspension that is agitated on a rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C for 10 min to ensure dissolution of the product. The dichloromethane is filtered through a pad of Celite (Note 24) (30 g), and the flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (30 mL x 3), which is filtered through the Celite. If the filtrate is not clear, a second filtration through a pad of Celite is necessary (Note 25). The dichloromethane is evaporated under reduced pressure with the aid of a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 260 mmHg). The residue is further dried at ambient temperature under high vacuum (<12 mmHg, 6 h) to afford N-trifluoromethylthiosaccharin (4) as a white solid (4.0-5.0 g, 61-77%) (Notes 26 and 27) (Figure 9).

Potassium hydroxide (3.9 g, 69 mmol, 3.8 equiv) (Note 18) is added at room temperature (Figures 8a-b). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and the stirring mixture is heated at 75 \u00b0C overnight (16 h) using an oil bath under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution is then cooled to room temperature (Figure 8c) and concentrated under reduced pressure (30 mmHg, 35 \u00baC). Dichloromethane (400 mL) and water (350 mL) are added and the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. After shaking, a white solid appeared in the organic phase (Figure 9a). The mixture is transferred into a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask, and neutralized with conc. HCl (Note 19), which is added dropwise via a pipette and checked after each drop with litmus paper. The aqueous layer is then back extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 400 mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (ca. 60 g), filtered through cotton wool in a glass funnel (15 cm diameter) into a 2 L round-bottomed flask. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C). Warm hexane (50 mL, 30 \u00baC) is added and the solution is cooled to 2 \u00baC in the fridge for 3 h (Figure 9b). The white solid is vacuum-filtered (1 mmHg) using a frit (4 cm diameter) and washed with hexane (2 x 10 mL).

The flask is charged with dry THF (75 mL) via a syringe and flushed with argon (Notes 2, 3, and 4). The reaction mixture is heated in an oil bath at 60 \u00baC (bath temperature) and stirred for 23 h under an argon atmosphere (Figure 1). The reaction mixture is a pale yellow homogeneous solution. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC analysis (Figure 2) (Note 5) and 31P NMR (Note 6). After consumption of 1, the straight glass tube is replaced with an ammonia-gas line inlet, and the reflux condenser is replaced with a glass stopper. The small glass stopper is replaced with a pressure-resistant rubber hose attached to a 3-way glass stopcock to discharge the excess of ammonia gas into a water bath. The mixture is cooled to 0 \u00baC in an ice bath, and the ammonia gas, set to a constant gas-feed at a pressure of approx. 0.015 MPa is bubbled into the reaction mixture through a glass tube at 0 \u00baC for 0.5 h (Figure 3). Then the ice-bath and ammonia-gas line inlet are removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 h under air with the precipitated ammonium chloride (Figure 4).

Sodium borohydride (4.54 g, 120 mmol, 2 equiv) and powdered sodium bicarbonate (20.16 g, 240 mmol, 4 equiv) are weighed and added to the flask via a powder funnel, open to air (Notes 2, 3, and 4). The flask is then charged with 2-methylpyridine (5.93 mL, 60 mmol, 1 equiv) via a syringe, followed by the addition of tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) (Figure 1). The heterogenous mixture is then stirred vigorously at room temperature, followed by the dropwise addition of water (4.3 mL, 240 mmol, 4 equiv) via a syringe over a period of 15 min (Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8). Once the addition of water is complete, tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) is added along the sides of the flask to wash the solids into the reaction mixture (Note 9).\nFigure 1. Reaction setup for synthesis of 2\nThe heterogenous mixture is stirred vigorously for 24 h at room temperature, open to air (Notes 10, 11 and 12) (Figure 2). The contents are filtered under vacuum through a bed of Celite (1-inch-thick) over an 80-mL sintered glass filter of coarse porosity (40-60 \u00b5m) (Figure 3).\nFigure 2. After stirring for 24 h at room temperature\nFigure 3.

The filter cake is then washed with tetrahydrofuran (3 x 20 mL) to extract the product from the filter cake. The tetrahydrofuran extracts are combined in a 500 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation (Note 13). The product is additionally dried under high vacuum (Note 14) for 12 h to obtain 2 (5.98 g, 93%) (Notes 15, 16, 17, and 18) as a white solid (Figure 4).\nFigure 4.

The reaction mixture is pressurized with argon (10.0 psi), stirred and then depressurized three times, and finally charged again with argon before sealing (Note 7). The reaction mixture is heated to 205 \u00b0C for 48 h. Then the reactor is cooled to 20 \u2070C with internal cooling coils. At the end of the experiment the reactor was left in the stand and the contents cooled to 20 \u00b0C using cold water. After cooling, the reactor is opened revealing an insoluble yellow solid on the surfaces (Figure 2) and dispersed in the aqueous phase (Note 8). All contents are transferred slowly to a 6 L separatory funnel aided by a large 5 cm glass funnel. Then the interior of the reactor is mechanically scraped (to extract the yellow material), with metal tongs, cotton balls (25 in total), and 500 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) from a spray bottle, and again all contents are added to the separatory funnel (Notes 9 and 10).\nFigure 1. a) 1 L Parr stirred reactor used for the reaction b) 4843 controller\nFigure 2. An example of the insoluble yellow solid found on the internal components after a successful reaction\nWhile still in the funnel, the cotton is rinsed with 25 mL of DCM from a spray bottle and evenly pressed with tongs to release the yellow material from the cotton (Note 9). After removing the cotton, the solution is then diluted with 2.5 L of DCM. The separatory funnel is shaken vigorously, allowed to settle and again shaken, and the organic layer is then slowly separated from the aqueous layer (Notes 11, 12 and 13) and the aqueous layer is further extracted with more DCM (3 x 10 mL), and the organic layers are combined (Note 14). The aqueous layers are kept for future ligand recovery. The combined organic layer is washed with a 1 M HCl solution, with vigorous mixing prior to separation (3 x 900 mL). Each HCl wash is then back extracted with DCM (3 x 10 mL) to insure complete recovery of the product. After the final wash, the organic layer is filtered slowly (20 min) through a Celite (35 g) pad on top of a 150 mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, into a 3 L round-bottomed flask, and then dried with 30 g of MgSO4. After filtering the drying reagent using a 4 L Erlenmyer flask fitted with a 5 cm funnel/cotton plug, a homogenous aliquot is removed for NMR analysis (Note 15). Finally, the solvent is removed in batches by transferring to a 2.5 L round-bottomed flask by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 30 mm Hg, 150 rpm) to afford 1.35 g (94%) of Ir(ppy)3 as a bright yellow solid (Note 16).\nFurther purification of Ir(ppy)3 can be performed by adding the yellow solid to a 1 L round-bottomed flask and adding 600 mL of distilled hexanes. The solid material is then sonicated until a uniform slurry is achieved, and 5 mL of dichloromethane is added (Note 17). The liquid is swirled giving a slight yellow tint to the solution indicating successful dissolution of a colored compound, and selective extraction of the impurities. Then the slurry is slowly poured through a 50 mL fine porosity sintered glass funnel to collect the yellow solid, and the filtrate is collected into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. The yellow solid is air dried on the filter to afford 1.29 g (91%) (Notes 18 and 19) of the product in >97% purity (Notes 20 and 21)."

The flask is resealed with the septum, THF (25 mL) (Note 9) is added by syringe, and the flask is partially submerged in an oil bath heated to 40 \u00b0C (Note 9). Once the mixture has become homogeneous, using a 6-mL plastic syringe, dimethoxy(methyl)silane (6.27 mL, 5.41 g, 50.9 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 10) is added dropwise over 10 min, during which the color of the solution gradually changes from blue to green to bright yellow to orange. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir for additional 12 h at 40 \u00b0C. The reaction is cooled to room temperature (23 \u00b0C), the septum is removed and saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (50 mL) is slowly added, followed by the addition of ethyl acetate (50 mL). After transferring the mixture to a 250-mL separatory funnel, the organic layer is separated and retained, and the aqueous layer is extracted with additional ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are concentrated with the aid of a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C water bath temperature, 50 mmHg) and purified by flash column chromatography (Note 15) to yield 3 as a colorless, viscous oil (6.54 g, 87%) in 90% enantiomeric excess (Figure 7) (Note 16).\nFigure 7.

The reaction mixture is cooled to -20 \u00baC using an CH3CN-dry ice bath. Sodium borohydride (3.02 g, 79.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added in ten portions (~300 mg every three min) via the neck with the plastic stopper, and the internal temperature is maintained at -20 \u00baC.\nFigure 1. Glassware assembly for the reduction step (picture obtained from submitters)\nAfter complete addition, the reaction is stirred for 45 min in the CH3CN-dry ice bath at -20 \u00baC, after which the reaction is allowed to warm up to 0 \u00baC. The reaction is monitored by TLC in 25% EtOAc in hexanes using ninhydrin to stain (Note 4). After stirring for 35 min at 0 \u00baC, TLC analysis shows disappearance of starting material. To the completed reaction, a mixture of ice-water (170 mL) is added to the solution with vigorous stirring and the solution is stirred for 10 min at 0 \u00baC (Note 5).

A 500-mL, three-neck, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum with a thermometer inserted through it, and a stopper, leaving the central neck open (Figure 1). To the flask are added dimethylformamide (DMF) (250 mL) (Note 2), p-toluidine (30.3 g, 280 mmol, 1 equiv), sulfur (18.0 g, 560 mmol, 2 equiv) and triethylamine (NEt3) (120 mL, 861 mmol, 3 equiv) (Note 3), and the contents of the flask are stirred at 700 rpm at 23 \u00b0C. Approximately 1 g portions of 2-chloroacetamide (31.5 g, 340 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 4) are added every two minutes over the course of an hour (Note 5) (Figure 2). The temperature of the reaction slowly increases upon addition of 2-chloroacetamide, and after approximately 16 min the internal temperature reaches 25 \u00b0C. The flask is then cooled using a 10 \u00b0C water bath, and the internal temperature of the reaction is maintained between 16-19 \u00b0C by occasional addition of ice to the water bath. Halfway through the addition, the stirring rate is increased to 850 rpm to account for the increasing viscosity of the reaction mixture.

After the addition is complete, the mixture is removed from the cooling bath and allowed to warm to 23 \u00baC (Figure 6). During this period the starting material reacts leading to a clear yellow solution from which TLC samples are taken to monitor reaction progress (Note 19). After about 1 h the reaction is complete as judged by disappearance of starting material by TLC. The reaction is poured into deionized water (500 mL). The resulting white precipitate is filtered through a 4.5 cm diameter medium porosity fritted filter and washed with deionized water until the filtrate is neutral (500-750 mL).

            "Within the last two decades, the development of efficient alkyne metathesis catalytic systems has allowed for the application of this methodology in both organic synthesis and materials chemistry.2,3,4,5,6 The utility of alkyne metathesis dynamic covalent chemistry (DCVC) for the preparation of complex molecular architectures has resulted in the use of this method for the synthesis of discrete, shape persistent molecular structures.3\nThe inherent reversibility of alkyne metathesis means that undesired byproducts must be continually removed in order to drive the reaction forward to a desired product.4,5 Classically, this may be achieved through the use of propynylated substrates that produce 2-butyne as a reaction byproduct (Figure 1A).5,7 This volatile product may then be removed via continually subjecting the reaction mixture to high vacuum.5,7 While this method can efficiently facilitate conversion to the desired product, the use of vacuum-driven metathesis conditions can lead to a number of drawbacks.4 In order to minimize solvent loss, high-boiling solvents such as toluene or chlorobenzenes are often used, or solvent must be periodically added.4 The efficiency of this method also decreases dramatically as the scale of the reaction is increased, greatly limiting the utility of vacuum-driven metathesis on large scale.7\nFigure 1. Comparison of vacuum and precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis\nIn order to address these limitations, we developed a precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis system (Figure 1B).7,8 This strategy relies on the incorporation of a precipitating group (PPG) into the desired reaction precursor (Figure 1B).7,8 Upon metathesis, the resulting diaryl acetylene byproduct precipitates from the reaction mixture thus driving the reaction equilibrium toward product formation.7 The advantage of this method is that it is highly effective for the large-scale synthesis of a variety of macrocycles (i.e. 1) via alkyne-metathesis that would afford low yields under classical vacuum-driven methods.7,8\nIn the years since we reported this method, the precipitating group strategy has been employed in both our own work and that of others.3 In addition to our original report where we prepared a variety of phenylene ethynylene macrocycles, we have also reported the synthesis of cyclic trimer 2 via precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis (Figure 2).7,8,9\nUpon mixing macrocycles 2 and 3 under metathesis conditions, tetrameric macrocycle 4 could be identified by mass spectrum analysis, demonstrating that arylene ethynylene macrocycles are dynamic under these conditions.9 Our own group and others have further demonstrated the utility of precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis in the development of a variety of robust alkyne metathesis catalysts.6,10,11,12,13,14 In order to simplify purification and catalyst lifetimes we have demonstrated that both solid silica-supported and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) ligands are highly active and selective catalysts for a variety of substrates, including those which rely on the use of the precipitation strategy.13,14 Zhang and coworkers have also pioneered the use of multidentate triphenol ligands that also show high catalytic activity and functional group tolerance and can be extended to the use of our precipitation driven method in high yields and short reaction times.10,11,12,15\nFigure 2. Dynamic trimeric and hexameric macrocycles Via precipitation-driven metathesis\nThe utility of precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis is particularly noteworthy for the synthesis of complex molecular cages.16,17,18,19,20 Zhang and coworkers have made use of this methodology for the preparation of a number of molecular cages (Figure 3). Cage 5 was prepared in 56% yield via precipitation driven metathesis from a rigid porphyrin precursor.17 Notably, this shape-persistent molecular prism shows high binding affinity for both C60 and C70 fullerenes, with the binding constant for encapsulation of C70 being three orders of magnitude greater than that for C60.\nFollowing this report, Zhang and coworkers prepared bisporphyrin macrocycle 6 in 60% yield through precipitation alkyne metathesis.19 Fullerene binding studies demonstrated that this macrocycle shows the highest affinity for C84. These results demonstrate the ability to prepare a number of structures with variable properties that can be accessed through efficient precipitation-driven metathesis.19 In addition to facilitating efficient metathesis, the use of the precipitating group moiety can improve the purification of complex substrates.16,20 Zhang and coworkers have demonstrated this in the synthesis of both carbazole20 and porphyrin16-based precursors. In both examples, the inclusion of the precipitating group was found to improve purification owing to its increased polarity over other alkyne substitutions. These results demonstrate the additional utility of this strategy as a handle for improved purification of metathesis precursors.\nFigure 3. Molecular cages prepared by Zhang and coworkers using precipitation-driven metathesis\nWhile precipitation driven alkyne metathesis is broadly applicable and has been widely used for many different substrates, this method requires additional synthetic overhead to include the precipitating moiety.4,7 Additionally, the high molecular weight of the precipitating group results in poor atom economy for the overall reaction.4 Methyl-capped alkynes produce volatile 2-butyne as a side product, which has classically been removed via vacuum to drive the reaction.7 In 2010, F\u00fcrstner and coworkers reported that 5\u00c5 molecular sieves efficiently sequester 2-butyne with comparable yields as precipitation and vacuum-driven procedures.21\nMolecular sieves have successfully been used to drive alkyne metathesis on a variety of different substrates, and can be used for large-scale synthesis in comparable yields to precipitation-based methods as demonstrated in the synthesis of carbazole macrocycle 7 (Figure 4).8,21 We have also demonstrated that carbazole macrocycle 7 may be prepared via a depolymerization/macrocyclization route from polymeric carbazole precursors.22\nFigure 4. Comparison of molecular sieves and vacuum/precipitation driven methods\nThe use of molecular sieves in alkyne metathesis is an effective and general method that has been widely applied in both natural product and materials synthesis.3,4 In recent years we have heavily relied on this method for the synthesis of a number of complex molecular architectures (Figure 5).23,24,25,26 In 2016 we reported the preparation of kinetically trapped tetrahedral cages (8) via alkyne metathesis from methyl-capped tritopic precursors using molecular sieves to sequester 2-butyne.25 This reaction proceeds through initial formation of oligomeric intermediates that 'self-correct' to the tetrahedral cage product. The use of propynylated substrates is particularly advantageous in terms of solubility for both precursors and reaction products, especially for reactions that proceed through initial formation of oligomeric intermediates along the pathway to a discrete product. We have also demonstrated the cyclooligomerization of bifunctional precursors to prepare cycloparaphenyleneacetylene precursors (9). Both of these processes proceed in near quantitative yields through the use of molecular sieves and can be performed on gram scales with similar efficiency.26 Commercial grade 5\u00c5 powdered molecular sieves are used for these reactions, and must be thoroughly dried in a vacuum oven prior to use. We typically employ a ratio of 800 mg to 1 g of molecular sieves per millimole of propynyl groups, and recommend stirring the mixture vigorously to ensure distribution of powdered sieves.25,26\nFigure 5. Tetrahedral cages and cyclooligomers prepared via alkyne metathesis using molecular sieves\nThe use of a precipitating group or a molecular sieves approach largely depends on both the synthetic overhead and structural characteristics of the system in question. The use of a precipitating-group strategy can be advantageous in terms of both scalability and purification of complex reaction precursors.8,16 The use of this moiety also results in poor atom economy and can complicate solubility of reaction precursors. The use of methyl-capped precursors in conjunction with molecular sieves is an attractive and scalable method with high efficiency.4,25 Installation of propyne groups is synthetically simple and significantly more atom economical. Overall, while both precipitation and molecular sieve strategies are viable methods that furnish very comparable yields and scalability across a wide range of precursors, the efficiency and synthetic ease of using a molecular-sieves driven approach make this method the most general for driving alkyne metathesis reactions.4,7"

            "Conjugate arylation of alkynes activated by an electron-withdrawing group is a practical method to prepare substituted alkenes. Conventionally, arylcopper reagents have been employed for this purpose,2 and the copper-catalyzed conjugate arylation using stoichiometric amounts of arylmagenesium halides has also been developed.3 The E/Z stereoselectivity of the arylation products strongly depends on the structures of the alkyne substrates and arylmetal reagents as well as the reaction conditions. Moreover, nucleophilic arylmetal reagents used in the conventional methods have limited functional group compatibility. In striking contrast, the transition metal-catalyzed hydroarylations of alkynes with a broad substrate scope have recently been developed using bench-top stable arylboron reagents.4 In particular, hydroarylation of activated alkynes generally afford products in which the aryl group is introduced at the carbon \u03b2 to the electron-withdrawing group.\nAlthough transition metal-catalyzed hydroarylations of alkynes are very useful, they require expensive rhodium or palladium catalysts, as well as additional ligands and/or additives. A few examples of catalysts based on inexpensive first-row transition metals, such as nickel and cobalt, have been reported, but they have seen limited development as compared to rhodium and palladium catalysts.5 We have independently developed a hydroarylation of internal alkynoates with arylboronic acids using inexpensive copper catalysts, such as CuOAc or Cu(OAc)2, in methanol at ambient temperature, which selectively afforded syn-hydroarylation products.6 Furthermore, neither ligands nor additives are required in this reaction. Thus, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynoates provides easy access to synthetically valuable \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted acrylates.\nWith the abovementioned features, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of internal alkynoates has been applied to the synthesis of various heterocyclic motifs, which are found in natural products and pharmaceutically important compounds. For example, 4-arylbutenolides, 4-arylpentenolides, and 4-arylcoumarins have been synthesized from alkynoates having an alcohol or phenol moiety on the alkyne terminalvia tandem Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation/lactonization processes.7,8 Representative examples are shown in Scheme 1. Notably, hydroarylation/coumarin formation enabled the efficient synthesis of seven natural neoflavones.\nScheme 1. Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation/lactonization\nNitrogen heterocycles have also been synthesized by Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation, as shown in Scheme 2.9,10,11 The hydroarylation product derived from (o-nitrophenyl)alkynoate 1 was converted into 3-phenyl-indole-2-carboxylate 2 in high yield via Mo-catalyzed Cadogan cyclization.9,12 Hydroarylation of the orthogonally protected (o-amino-phenyl)alkynoate 3 could be performed under similar conditions to afford an N-benzyl-4-aryl-2-quinolone after acidic removal of the Boc group.10 Because of the bulky protected o-aminophenyl moiety, protodeboration of the arylboronic acid proceeded faster than the desired hydroarylation. Thus, arylboronic acid 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol esters, such as 4, should be used to suppress the undesired protodeboration. The use of a sterically more demanding pinacol ester retarded the reaction, thus diminishing the product yield. This tandem hydroarylation/lactamization process could be successfully applied to the synthesis of a natural alkaloid and relevant derivatives.11\nScheme 2. N-Heterocycles synthesis via Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation\nBesides alkynoates, other electron-deficient alkynes have also been used as substrates for Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation. The hydroarylation of 3-aryl-2-propynenitriles stereoselectively affords 3,3-diarylacrylonitriles,13 and this method has been successfully extended to the synthesis of antitumor agent CC-5079 (Scheme 3).14 Since the biological activity of CC-5079 strongly depends on its olefin geometry,15 Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation is quite useful as it affords both stereoisomers in a stereospecific manner. Trifluoromethyl groups also function as electron-withdrawing groups, as Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation efficiently proceeds with (trifluoromethyl)-alkynes, affording valuable tri-substituted (trifluoromethyl)alkenes.16 Thus, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of (trifluoromethyl)alkyne 4 with (o-nitro)phenylboronic acid stereoselectively furnished trisubstituted alkene 5, which was further transformed into 3-aryl-2-(trifluoromethyl)indole 6 in high yield via the modified Cadogan cyclization (Scheme 4).17\nScheme 3. Synthesis of CC-5079\nScheme 4. Synthesis of 3-aryl-2-(trifluoromethyl)indole\nEnantioselective conjugate reduction of \u03b2,\u03b2-diaryl-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds provides efficient access to chiral 1,1-diarylalkyl motifs, which are frequently found in bioactive molecules. Therefore, stereoselective construction of the required unsaturated carbonyl precursors is crucial, and Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation has been used for this purpose.18 As a demonstration of this strategy, Yun and co-workers reported the enantioselective synthesis of (R)-tolterodine,19 a potent muscarinic antagonist, via Cu-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate reduction of a 3,3-diarylacrylonitrile (Scheme 5).20 The required acrylonitrile precursor 8 was obtained in 71% yield via Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of cyanoalkyne 7 bearing an unprotected phenol moiety with phenylboronic acid. Subsequent asymmetric conjugate reduction of 8 with polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as the reducing agent was performed in the presence of 2 mol % Cu(OAc)2 and 2 mol % chiral ligand 9 ((R)-(S)-Josiphos) in toluene at room temperature, affording the desired saturated 3,3-diarylpropanenitrile 10 in 86% yield and with 96% ee. Finally, 10 was transformed to (R)-tolterodine in 63% yield over two steps.\nScheme 5. Enantioselective synthesis of (R)-tolterodine\nWhen allylboronate was used instead of arylboron reagents under the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation conditions, hydroallylation products were obtained with high regio- and stereoselectivities. Notably, this mild Cu-catalyzed protocol selectively produced 1,4-dienes in good yields, although such a skipped diene tends to undergo isomerization to a more stable 1,3-diene (conjugate diene). Hydroallylation proceeded with alkynylamide 11b and alkynylsulfone 11c, in addition to alkynoates and cyanoalkynes (Scheme 6).21 The introduced allyl moiety could be employed as a synthetic handle for subsequent transformations, such as hydroboration/oxidation or hydroboration/Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. The interesting bicyclic butenolide 15 was also synthesized from 1,6-enynoate 13 via sequential hydroallylation/ring-closing metathesis.22 Furthermore, Kong, Zhu, and co-workers reported the hydroallylation of thioalkynes, such as 16.23 In this case, modified conditions with a mixed solvent (MeOH/THF, 1:3) improved the product yield. The obtained product 17 could be used for nickel-catalyzed cross coupling with Grignard reagents via C-S bond cleavage.\nScheme 6. Cu-catalyzed hydroallylation of internal alkynes\nA disadvantage of Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation and hydroallylation is that they are restricted to the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. Hence, an alternative method to synthesize tetrasubstituted alkenes was developed by Sawamura, Ohmiya, and co-workers: the three-component coupling of an alkynoate, alkyl-9-BBN 18, and nBu3 SnOMe proceeded in the presence of catalytic amounts of CuOAc andtBuOK in dioxane at 60 \u00b0C, affording alkenylstannane 19 in 74% yield with a syn/anti ratio of 97:3 (Scheme 7).24 The obtained product could be utilized as a substrate for various cross-coupling reactions. When adding tBuOH instead of nBu3SnOMe as the proton source, hydroalkylation product 20 was also obtained quantitatively.25 In this case, the use of P(OPh)3 as the ligand was necessary to achieve a complete syn selectivity.\nScheme 7. Cu-catalyzed stannylalkylation and hydroalkylation\nIn summary, Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of electron-deficient alkynes with arylboron reagents has been developed as an efficient protocol for the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of valuable trisubstituted alkenes with a functional group under mild conditions. This method is also intriguing because inexpensive copper acetates act as catalysts, and neither ligands nor additives are required. The broad substrate scope of this Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation has been exploited for the synthesis of important heterocyclic compounds, including butenolides, pentenolides, coumarins, indoles, and 2-quinolones. Moreover, the protocol was extended to hydroallylation and hydroalkylation/stannylalkylation using allylboronates or alkylborons, respectively, instead of arylboron reagents. In the future, these methods are expected to find broad application in the synthesis of natural products, functional materials, and bioactive molecules.\nReferences\nDepartment of Basic Medicinal Sciences, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.

After 10 min, the biphasic mixture is poured into a 500 mL separatory funnel containing ethyl acetate (50 mL) and water (50 mL). The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 25 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated NaCl solution (3 x 25 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (12.5 g), and filtered through a 100-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (medium porosity, 66 mm diameter).\nFigure 1. Color change through the course of the reaction\nThe MgSO4 is washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 10 mL) and the combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford ca. 11.7 g of a pale yellow oil. This material is diluted with ethyl acetate (2.5 mL) and deposited onto a column (90 mm diameter) of 410 g of silica gel (12 cm high) (Note 10) prepared as a slurry in 10:1 ethyl acetate-MeOH. Elution is carried out with 10:1 ethyl acetate-MeOH collecting 50-mL fractions. The desired product is obtained in fractions 18-34 (Note 11). Mixed fractions 11-17 are collected separately and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) (Note 12). The resulting colorless oil is diluted with ethyl acetate (1.5 mL) and loaded onto a column (60 mm diameter) of 200 g of silica gel (5.5 cm high) (Note 10) prepared as a slurry in 10:1 ethyl acetate-MeOH. Elution is carried out with 10:1 ethyl acetate-MeOH collecting 50-mL fractions. The desired product is obtained in fractions 11-23. All fractions containing pure product according to TLC (Note 11) are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at 25 \u00b0C under 0.1 mmHg for 2 h provides 7.5 g (78%) of amino stannane 1 as a colorless oil (Notes 9, 13, 14 and 15).",

An oven-dried 250-mL pear-shaped recovery flask equipped with a 40 x 20 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar is charged with 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves (1.72 g) (Note 16) and acetonitrile (75 mL) (Note 17) via a syringe. The flask is fitted with a rubber septum and nitrogen inlet needle, after which the stir rate is set to ca. 375 rpm. 1-((Tributylstannyl)methoxy)propan-2-amine (1) (6.5 g, 17.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Notes 13 and 14) prepared in step A is added in one portion via a syringe followed by 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzaldehyde (2.73 g, 17.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 18) that is weighed in air and is added in one portion to the reaction flask. The pale-yellow suspension is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 4 h (Note 19). The resulting yellow suspension is filtered over 2.5 g of Celite in a 30-mL sintered glass funnel (30 mm diameter, medium porosity) into a 250-mL pear-shaped recovery flask. The solid material is rinsed with acetonitrile (3 x 5 mL), and the filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford ca. 8.9 g of the imine as a clear yellow oil (Notes 20 and 21).\nSeparately, an oven-dried 1-L pear-shaped recovery flask equipped with a 40 x 20 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum and a nitrogen inlet needle is charged with Cu(OTf)2 (6.2 g, 17.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 22 and 23). Dichloromethane (250 mL) (Note 24) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (65 mL) (Note 25) are added via a syringe. Stirring with a rate of ca. 400 rpm is started and 2,6-lutidine (1.99 mL, 1.84 g, 17.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 26 and 27) is added over 5 min via a syringe to the grey suspension affording a green suspension containing scattered lumps of Cu(OTf)2 (Figure 2a). This suspension is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h affording a more homogeneous dark green suspension (Figure 2b) (Note 28).\nFigure 2. Color change through the course of the copper complex formation\nA solution of the imine prepared earlier (ca. 8.9 g) (Notes 20 and 21) in dichloromethane (10 mL) (Note 24) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min affording a brown reaction mixture. The flask that contained the imine is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 x 2.5 mL) (Note 24) that are added to the reaction mixture via syringe in one portion.\nThe resulting brown reaction mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h affording a green suspension that is quenched with a pre-mixed solution of 1:1 water-NH4OH solution (150 mL) (Note 29), which is added via a graduated cylinder in one portion (Notes 30 and 31). The biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously (ca. 800 rpm) for 30 min before being poured into a 1-L separatory funnel. The blue aqueous layer is separated and extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 25 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with a pre-mixed solution of 1:1 water-NH4OH solution (2 x 40 mL) (Note 29) and saturated NaCl solution (2 x 40 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (15 g), and filtered through a 150-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (medium porosity, 66 mm diameter). The MgSO4 is washed with dichloromethane (3 x 15 mL) and the combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The resulting brown oil is further concentrated at 40 \u00b0C and ca. 0.1 mmHg to remove most of the 2,6-lutidine (prior to chromatographic purification) affording ca. 13.0 g of brown oil (Note 32). This material is diluted with dichloromethane (5 mL) and deposited onto a column (90 mm diameter) of 340 g of silica gel (10 cm high) (Note 10) prepared as a slurry in 12:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate. Elution is carried out with 12:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate (2 L) and then 9:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate, collecting 50-mL fractions. The desired product is obtained in fractions 28-65 (Note 33). These fractions are combined, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at 25 \u00b0C under 0.1 mmHg for 2 h provides 2.55 g (65%) of morpholine 2 as a yellow oil (Figure 3) (Notes 9, 15, 34 and 35).\nFigure 3. Product of Step B"

[13C]Methyl-p-toluenesulfonate: (1).2 A 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval) is charged with sodium hydroxide (30.3 g, 758 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 2). The flask is placed in an ice bath and water (50 mL) (Note 3) is added in one portion with stirring. [13C]Methanol (5.00 g, 151.5 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 4) is weighed in a 12 mL syringe and slowly added to the hydroxide solution at 0 \u00b0C. p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl) (34.7 g, 182 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 5) is weighed into a 250 mL single-necked conical flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (30 mm x 15 mm, oval). Tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 6) is added to this flask and stirred under nitrogen until all the TsCl dissolves. This solution is added over five min via cannulation under nitrogen to the NaOH reaction flask, which is cooled in an ice bath. The conical flask is rinsed with THF (5 mL), which is then added to the round-bottomed flask. The internal sides of the RBF are then rinsed with additional THF (5 mL) via syringe before sealing with a rubber septum and venting with a small needle (Figure 1A). The ice-bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to 25 \u00b0C with stirring over 20 h (Note 7). The reaction is neutralized by the slow addition of acetic acid (33 mL, 576 mmol, 3.8 equiv) (Note 8) at 0 \u00b0C over 5 min. The reaction mixture is left unstirred for 20 min at 0 \u00b0C to induce crystallization of sodium acetate (Note 9). The reaction mixture is then filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) to remove solid sodium acetate and the filtrate layers of THF and water are separated in a 250 mL separating funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 60 mL) (Note 10). The filter cake is dissolved in water (150 mL) along with residue in the reaction flask and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 60 mL). The organic phases are combined, transferred to a 500 mL separating funnel, washed with sat. aq. Na2CO3 (100 mL) (Note 11) and sat. aq. NaCl (100 mL) (Note 12), dried over Na2SO4 (~40 g) for 10 min (Note 13), and filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The sodium sulfate is placed on the same sintered glass funnel and rinsed using additional ethyl acetate (40 mL). The organic solvent is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (150 to 7 mmHg). A clear, colorless oil is obtained and transferred to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask with diethyl ether rinsings (~50 mL) (Note 14) and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (600 to 7 mmHg). Additional diethyl ether (~50 mL) is added and the concentration repeated to give 27.1 g (96%) of a slightly yellow oil (Figure 1B) (Notes 15 and 16).\nFigure 1.

A dry 500 mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval), a nitrogen inlet and a rubber septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained this way over the course of the reaction. The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (175 mL) (Note 17) and cooled to -78 \u00b0C (Note 18). n-Butyllithium (68 mL, 2.45 M in hexanes, 167 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Notes 19 and 20) is added to the cooled THF with efficient stirring (Note 21). Benzophenone imine (29 mL, 174 mmol, 1.15 equiv) is dissolved in THF (40 mL), and the solution is added via cannulation over a period 10 min to give a blue solution (Note 22). The benzophenone imine flask is rinsed with THF (10 mL) and added to the reaction flask (Figure 2A). [13C]Methyl p-toluenesulfonate (1) is dissolved in THF (40 mL) and added via cannulation using a double-ended needle over 10 min to the cold (-78 \u00b0C) solution. The methyl p-toluenesulfonate flask is rinsed with THF (10 mL), which is added to the reaction flask. The stir-rate is increased to facilitate a mild vortex (Note 23) and the flask is transferred to a large ice-bath and allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C over 20 min (Note 24). The flask is placed in a large water bath at 23 \u00b0C for a further 45 min. The reaction is quenched with water (5 mL), transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel and partitioned with water (200 mL) and Et2O (200 mL) (Note 25). The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is back extracted with Et2O (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with sat. aq. Na2CO3 (100 mL), sat. aq. NaCl (100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 (~40 g) for 10 min, and filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The sodium sulfate is washed in the same sintered glass funnel using additional Et2O (40 mL). The bright yellow solution is concentrated in vacuo (600 to 7 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a yellow oil (35 g). The oil is treated with petroleum ether (250 mL, bp 35-60 \u00b0C) (Note 26) to give a cloudy solution, which is placed in a fridge (4 \u00b0C) for 20 h. A short pad of CeliteTM 545 (3 cm deep) (Note 27), which is first wetted with 50 mL of petroleum ether, is prepared in a 60 mL glass funnel (medium frit). The mixture is then filtered through the CeliteTM into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask using petroleum ether (150 mL). The solution is concentrated in vacuo (40 \u00b0C, 500 to 120 to 7 mmHg) to give a yellow oil (32 g) (Figure 2B) (Note 28).

A dry 1 L, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval), a nitrogen inlet and two rubber septa is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained this way over the course of the reaction (Figure 3A). The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (240 mL) and d iisopropylamine (30.3 mL, 216 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 30) before being cooled to -78 \u00b0C (Note 31). n-Butyllithium (88.1 mL, 2.45 M in hexanes, 216 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added with stirring to the diisopropylamine solution. After 5 min stirring at -78 \u00b0C, chlorotrimethylsilane (29.2 mL, 230 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 32) is added over 3 min followed immediately by N-[13C]methyl benzophenone imine (2) that is dissolved in THF (40 mL), which is added over the course of 5 min. The flask that contained compound 2 is rinsed with THF (10 mL), which is added to the three-necked flask. A dark solution is formed, which can be dark green to dark red depending on slight changes in the amount of unreacted benzophenone imine. Figure 3B shows the dark green color of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at -78 \u00b0C for 15 mins, at which time the dry ice/acetone bath is removed and a dry ice/CHCl3 bath (-60 \u00b0C) is added (Note 33). The reaction is maintained at this temperature for 5 h. The reaction is quenched at -60 \u00b0C by the slow addition of acetone (6.3 mL, 86 mmol, 0.6 equiv) (Note 34) and the resulting quenched solution left to stir for 10 min at this temperature (Note 35). The reaction mixture is transferred to a large 23 \u00b0C water bath and allowed to warm over 15 min to give a yellow-orange solution (Figure 3C). The solution is transferred to a 1 L single-necked, round-bottomed flask, and the three-necked flask is rinsed with petroleum ether (50 mL), which is added to the single-necked, round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (500 to 120 to 7 mmHg). The residue is suspended in petroleum ether (150 mL), filtered through a 3 cm plug of CeliteTM 545 filter aid (Note 36) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask with petroleum ether (70 mL) and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (500 to 120 to 7 mmHg).\nThe residue is once more dissolved in petroleum ether (150 mL), cooled in an ice-water bath for ~20 min, filtered through a ~3 cm pad of CeliteTM 545 with additional petroleum ether (70 mL) into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 3 mmHg) to give the crude product (~44 g) as a clear yellow to orange oil (Figure 3D) (Notes 37 and 38).

A solution of N-[13C]methyl(trimethylsilyl)-benzophenone imine (44 g crude) in MTBE (350 mL) (Note 41) is placed in a hydrogenation apparatus containing 10 g of Pd/C (10%) (Note 42) (Figure 4A). The mixture is stirred under 20 psi of hydrogen for 24 h (Note 43), at which time LCMS show all the starting material is consumed (Note 44).\nThe mixture is filtered through a short pad of CeliteTM 545 and rinsed with MTBE (100 mL). The colorless filtrate solution is stirred for 15 min while bubbling nitrogen slowly into the solution. A solution of 2M HCl in ether (Note 45) is added slowly over 45 min to give a fluffy white solid, and stirring is continued for 2 h (Note 46). The mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel (Note 47) to collect the solid trimethylsilylmethylamine hydrochloride salt. After drying under suction for 1 h, the vacuum is removed and the solid is broken up using a spatula. MTBE (50 mL) is added to the solid and stirred using the spatula for 2 min. Vacuum is applied again to remove the solvent and isolate a fluffy white solid (15.5 g) (Note 48). This product is transferred to a 250 mL round bottomed flask and suspended in isopropanol (100 mL) (Note 49). The suspension is heated in an oil bath to 85 \u00b0C to give a slight yellow solution. The temperature of the oil bath is reduced to 40 \u00b0C and MTBE (300 mL) is added slowly via a funnel. The product begins to precipitate before all MTBE is added. The resulting suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature over 30 min and then placed in the freezer at -20 \u00b0C and left overnight.\nFiltration through a sintered funnel and rinsing with MTBE (50 mL) gives shiny white fluffy crystals, which are dried under suction using an inverted funnel dispensing nitrogen (Figure 4B) for 2 h to give white crystals (10.56 g, 52%) (Notes 50 and 51) (Figure 4C), which are stored in a screw cap flask.\nFigure 4.

The combined organic phases are washed with H2O (70 mL) and brine (70 mL), dried over Na2SO4 (70 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (15 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The flask containing the residue was attached to a vacuum line with gentle heating using a dryer to completely remove the ethyl acetate.\nThe slightly pale yellow oil solidifies after a few minutes in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask (Note 9) (Figure 4). The crude solid (38.34 g) is crushed into particles, and the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser (10 cm height) and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (Note 10). 2-Propanol (30 mL) (Note 11) is poured into the flask, which is then immersed in a water bath heated to 70 \u00b0C. The solution is stirred for ca. 5 min and the solid completely dissolves (Figure 5). After removal of the water bath, the solution is allowed to cool gradually to room temperature (20 ~ 25 \u00b0C). Over the course of 3 h colorless crystals appear. Using a glass filter (G3, 70 mm diameter), the first crop is filtered, collected, and washed twice with 2-propanol (2 x 20 mL) to yield 18.76 g (80%, E/Z = 1:99) of the desired product (Z)-1 as colorless crystals (Note 12) (Figure 6).\nFigure 4.

The flask is charged with methyl 1-cyclopentene-1-carboxylate (1) (Note 2) (7.0 g, 55 mmol, 1.0 equiv). Ethyl acetate (280 mL) (Note 3) is added, followed by 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves (7.0 g) (Note 4). The septum is replaced with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is capped with a septum. A tert-butylhydroperoxide solution in decane (5.5 M) (41 mL, 221 mmol, 4.0 equiv) is added via the addition funnel over 15 min (Figure 1) (Note 5). The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min.\nFigure 1. Addition of t-BuOOH\nManganese(III) acetate dihydrate (1.487 g, 5.5 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Figure 2) (Note 6) is transferred to a vial in a glove bag under a nitrogen atmosphere and the solid is added quickly to the reaction mixture. The argon balloon is removed and the reaction flask is flushed with oxygen using a balloon for 10 min (Figure 3).\nFigure 2. Glove bag\nThe reaction mixture is stirred under an oxygen atmosphere at 23 \u00b0C for 48 h using a balloon filled with oxygen (Figure 4) (Note 7). The reaction is monitored by TLC on silica using 30% EtOAc-hexane as the eluent (Note 8). After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is filtered through a Celite pad (Note 9) that is then washed with diethyl ether (40 mL). The filtrate is diluted with water (150 mL) and transferred to 1 L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and the organic layer is washed again with water (150 mL). The organic extract is tested for peroxides with KI starch paper and no color is observed (Note 10). The organic extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for 10 min and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg).

The middle neck is fitted with a pressure equalizing addition funnel (150 mL) equipped with a rubber septum and an argon balloon. One side neck is equipped with a septum pierced by a thermometer and the remaining neck is sealed with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with methyl 3-oxocyclopent-1-enecarboxylate (2) (3.0 g, 21.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv), followed by the addition of dichloromethane (214 mL, 0.1 M) by syringe. The reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath with stirring for 10 min (Note 15). A solution of bromine (1.62 mL, 32.1 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 16) in dichloromethane (40 mL) is charged into the addition funnel and is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 30 min. The addition funnel is rinsed with dichloromethane (4 mL). The initially colorless solution turned red over the course of this addition (Figure 5A). After complete addition of the bromine solution, the reaction mixture is warmed to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 h (Figure 5B). The reaction mixture is again cooled in an ice bath and a solution of triethylamine (5.98 mL, 42.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 17) in dichloromethane (40 mL) (Note 18) is carefully added dropwise through the addition funnel to the reaction mixture over 30 min (Note 19). The red-colored solution turns yellow during the addition of triethylamine (Figure 6A) (Note 20). After complete addition, the reaction mixture is again warmed to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 8 h, during which time the yellow color turns red (Figure 6B).

            "Phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands, originally developed by Pfaltz, Helmchen, and Williams,2,3,4 comprise a privileged class of P,N type ligands with extensive applications in various transition-metal catalyzed processes, including allylic alkylations, Heck-type reactions, and catalytic hydrogenation.5,6 The PHOX ligand class is highly modular and has grown to encompass numerous structural variations, of which only a few major classes are shown in Figure 1. Every component of the ligand scaffold is modifiable as exemplified by R1 variations on the oxazoline ring (1, 2), substitution of the aryl rings with perfluoroalkyl groups (2) or ferrocenyl systems (3), and various alkyl and spirocyclic7 linkers joining the oxazoline ring to the phosphine backbone (4a-b).6\nFigure 1. Phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands are highly modular\nThe substituted tri-aryl PHOX ligands 1 are of particular interest to our laboratory. Since our 2009 Organic Syntheses articles, which described an optimized route to the valuable PHOX ligand (S)-t-BuPHOX 1a and its use in a Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative allylic alkylation reaction toward the synthesis of (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone,8,9 electronic and steric modifications to the scaffold of 1a have found increasing traction in the literature.10,11,12 In particular, electron-deficient counterparts such as (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5), (S)-(CF3)4-t-BuPHOX (6), and (S)-(CF3)4(F)-t-BuPHOX (7), which contain trifluoromethyl groups at strategic positions on the aryl rings, have been uniquely effective and in many cases superior to 1a in various highly enantioselective metal-catalyzed reactions.13,14 These ligands may be synthesized through modified procedures based on our original Organic Syntheses article.8,10,13 This Discussion Addendum highlights recent applications of 1a and its electron-deficient variants 5-7 in total synthesis and reaction development, with an emphasis on decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions.\nFigure 2. Electron-deficient variants of (S)-t-BuPHOX\nPHOX Ligands in Reaction Development\nAside from their common use in various asymmetric allylic allylation-type reactions,15,16,17 PHOX ligands 1a and 5-7 have recently been utilized in diverse transformations including sigmatropic rearrangements,18 hydroarylation reactions,19 carboaminations,20 asymmetric alkylations and protonations,21,22 and cascade reactions.23 The chemical motifs produced by these PHOX-catalyzed reactions are often found in biologically active small molecules and can also serve as synthetically valuable intermediates. For instance in 2012, Kozlowski presented a rare example of a catalytic enantioselective Saucy-Marbet Claisen rearrangement using 1a to effect the transformation of propargyl ethers 8 into allenyl oxindoles 9 (Scheme 1).18 However, 1a was effective only for a subset of aryl-substituted alkyne substrates.\nScheme 1. Synthesis of quaternary allenyl indoles using an enantioselective Saucy-Marbet Claisen rearrangement\nLater in 2015, 1a was also utilized by Wolfe in a Pd-catalyzed alkene carboamination reaction involving allylphenyltriflates 10 and aliphatic amines to generate chiral aminoindanes 11, a motif that appears in a variety of pharmacologically active molecules (Scheme 2).20 Interestingly, the crucial aminopalladation step consists of an intermolecular reaction.\nScheme 2. Synthesis of aminoindanes via alkene carboamination\nIn 2017, Zhu used 1a and a stoichiometric amount of tetrahydroxy diboron-water as the hydride donor to effect an asymmetric intramolecular reductive Heck reaction of N-aryl acrylamides 12 to give 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles 13 (Scheme 3).19 Notably, the choice of ligand affected the reaction pathway: whereas PPh3 led to carboboration products, 1a gave the desired hydroarylation product 13.\nScheme 3. Synthesis of quaternary oxindoles via asymmetric intramolecular reductive Heck reaction\nRecently, in an elegant extension of our work on asymmetric alkylation of 3-halooxindoles,24 Bisai and co-workers disclosed the use of a Cu-1a catalyst to effect malonate addition onto 3-hydroxy 3-indolyl-2-oxindoles 14 (Scheme 4).21 It is thought that the copper catalyst facilitates a stereoablative elimination of water, followed by asymmetric addition of the malonate.\nScheme 4. Synthesis of quaternary dimeric oxindoles by malonate addition onto 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles\nLam discovered that a Nickel-PHOX catalyst comprised of 1a or (S)-PhPHOX effectively catalyzed the coupling of alkynyl malonate esters 16 with arylboronic esters in a desymmetrizing arylative cyclization (Scheme 5).23 The resulting cyclopentenone products 17 contain a synthetically challenging fully substituted olefin and a chiral quaternary center.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of chiral cyclopentenones via nickel-catalyzed desymmetrization of alkynyl malonate esters with arylboronic acids\nWith regard to allylic alkylation-type reactions, 1a and its electron deficient counterparts 5-7 have found extensive applications: After our initial reports on asymmetric decarboxylative protonation,25,26 the Guiry group has continued to expand the scope and understanding of this reaction. In one example in 2017, they utilized (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) to enable the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary \u03b1-arylated indanones 19 (Scheme 6).27\nScheme 6. Synthesis of chiral tertiary \u03b1-aryl indanones using decarboxylative protonation\nIn 2017, Malcolmson introduced a method to synthesize chiral allylic amines 21 through the intermolecular addition of aliphatic amines to acyclic 1,3-dienes 20 (Scheme 7).15 Here, the electron deficient PHOX ligand 6 was critical in achieving high regioselectivity for the desired 1,2-hydroamination product.\nScheme 7. Synthesis of allylic amines via diene hydroamination\nRecently, You employed a Pd-7 catalyst in a dearomative formal [3+2] cycloaddition of nitroindoles 22 and epoxybutenes 23 to synthesize chiral quaternary tetrahydrofuroindoles 24 (Scheme 8).14 Notably, the diastereoselectivity of this reaction was affected by the choice of solvent, with toluene and acetonitrile providing differing diastereomers.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of tetrahydrofuroindoles via dearomative formal [3+2] cycloaddition of nitroindoles and epoxybutenes\nAlong with the Trost laboratory and others, our group has pioneered the development of transition metal-catalyzed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions to generate quaternary stereocenter-containing compounds. Following our initial efforts on cycloalkanone systems using (S)-t-BuPHOX,28,29 we have extended the reaction to a wide range of cyclic substrates important in pharmaceuticals and natural product synthesis (Table 1).30,31,32,33,34,35 This versatile methodology now enables the synthesis of chiral disubstituted carbocycles of ring size four to eight, \"Mannich\" adducts, and heterocycles. Especially in the case of lactam systems 29-36, the electron deficient ligand 5 was hypothesized to generate a more reactive palladium catalyst and was required to achieve high levels of asymmetry.\nTable 1. Chiral \u03b1-disubstituted carbocycles and lactams accessible by decarboxylative allylic alkylation\nFurthermore, in an effort to reduce catalyst loadings to facilitate industrial scale applications, we developed a low-catalyst loading method employing Pd(OAc)2 instead of the usual zero-valent palladium source (Scheme 9).36 With this protocol, catalyst loadings as low as 0.075 mol %, corresponding with turnover numbers (TON) of up to 1320, could be used while still providing yields and ee's up to 99%.\nScheme 9. Low-palladium loading protocol for decarboxylative allylic alkylation\nMost recently in 2018, we extended the scope of decarboxylative allylic alkylation toward challenging acyclic substrates by reporting the first asymmetric decarboxylative alkylation of fully substituted acyclic enol carbonates to provide linear \u03b1-quaternary ketones 38, again employing electronic deficient PHOX ligand 5 (Scheme 10).37,38 Of particular interest, the same enantiomer of product was obtained with comparably high ee regardless of the E/Z ratio of the starting material, suggesting a possible dynamic kinetic enolate equilibration during the reaction.\nScheme 10. Synthesis of acyclic \u03b1-quaternary ketones using decarboxylative alkylation\nPHOX ligands in Natural Product Synthesis\nAs a testament to the versatility of allylic alkylation-type reactions, recent total syntheses that utilize PHOX ligands do so heavily in the context of transition-metal catalyzed allylic alkylations and protonations. For instance, in Takemoto's 2014 synthesis of the tricyclic alkaloid (-)-aurantioclavine (39), 1a was used in an intramolecular allylic amination of allyl carbonate 37 to generate an unusual seven-membered azepane 38 (Scheme 11).39\nScheme 11. Total synthesis of (-)-aurantioclavine via allylic amination\nSimilarly, in 2012 and 2014, we used a series of powerful allylic alkylations to intercept chiral gem-disubstituted cyclic intermediates 41, 44, and 47 en route to the formal syntheses of seven natural products including (-)-thujopsene (42), (-)-quinic acid (45), and (+)-rhazinilam (48) (Scheme 12).33,40\nScheme 12. Formal syntheses of diverse natural products via allylic alkylation\nDecarboxylative protonation has also found utility in natural product synthesis. In route to a 2014 catalytic enantioselective formal synthesis of the hexacyclic caged indole alkaloid (-)-aspidofractinine (51), Shao used 1a in an enantioselective decarboxylative protonation reaction to forge C3-monosubstitutions on medicinally important carbazolone heterocycles 50 (Scheme 13).41 Later in 2017, Robinson and co-workers also used 1a in a decarboxylative protonation protocol to make \u03b1-substituted ketone 53, which was then divergently advanced toward the spirocyclic marine alkaloids (-)-fasicularin (54) and (-)-lepadiformine (55).42\nScheme 13. Total syntheses of (-)-aspidofractinine, (-)-lepadiformine, and (-)-fasicularin using decarboxylative protonation\nMost of the remaining recent examples of PHOX ligands 1a and 5-7 in total synthesis have been found in the context of decarboxylative allylic alkylation toward the synthesis of indole alkaloid natural products (Scheme 14).43 For example, vinylogous ether 56, prepared from a (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a)-catalyzed allylic alkylation, can be advanced to (-)-aspidospermidine (57) in a formal total synthesis.40 Similarly, the familiar gem-disubstituted lactam 47 serves as an intermediate in the formal syntheses of (+)-quebrachamine (60) and (-)-vincadifformine (61).40 In 2014, Mukai synthesized the pentacyclic indole (+)-kopsihainanine A (59) utilizing (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) in a decarboxylative alkylation to generate lactam intermediate 58.44 Notably, (+)-kopsihainanine A was previously independently synthesized by both Shao and Lupton in 2013, who also also utilized decarboxylative alkylation to synthesize a structurally distinct carbazolone intermediate.45,46\nScheme 14. Decarboxylative allylic alkylation in the total synthesis of indole alkaloid natural products\nIn 2016, Zhu accomplished the syntheses of indole alkaloids (-)-rhazinilam (63), (-)-leucomidine B (64), and (+)-leuconodine F (65) via a divergent route from quaternary cyclopentanone 62, which was synthesized via allylic alkylation using ligand 1a.47 Ligand 5 was again utilized to obtain the dihydropyrido[1,2-a]indolone (DHPI) scaffold 66, which was crucial in our 2016 and 2017 total and formal syntheses of five indole alkaloids, (+)-limaspermidine (67), (+)-kopsihainanine (59), (-)-quebrachamine (68), (+)-aspidospermidine (69), and (-)-goniomitine (70).48,49 Most recently, Qin in 2017 leveraged ligand 1a to synthesize the quaternary indole 71, paving the way to a divergent synthesis of five Kopsia indole alkaloids: (-)-fruticosine (72), (+)-methyl chanofruticosinate (73), (-)-isokopsine (74), (-)-kopsine (75), and (-)-kopsanone (76).50\nFinally, in 2018 Li and co-workers reported an asymmetric synthesis of the pentacyclic anti-tumor alkaloid (-)-cephalotaxine (79) using decarboxylative alkylation on allyl enol carbonate precursor 77.51 Here, they utilized ligand 5 to attain 78 with high enantioselectivity; in contrast, (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a) provided the desired product in only 80% ee.\nScheme 15. Total synthesis of (-)-cephalotaxine\nThese aforementioned natural product syntheses highlight the impressive synthetic versatility of enantioselective allylic alkylation reactions facilitated by PHOX ligands. Especially in the cases of indole alkaloid syntheses, decarboxylative alkylation was used to synthesize a range of structurally diverse quaternary stereocenter-bearing intermediates, which were advanced toward the desired natural products. Additionally, electron-deficient variants of (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a) such as (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) have demonstrated superior efficacy in many instances, and are likely to find even wider use in the future, especially toward the synthesis of novel all-carbon quaternary stereocenter-bearing scaffolds using decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation methodologies. The PHOX ligand class has shown extensive versatility in various transition-metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations, thus enabling access to novel and biologically important chemical space. Their modular nature ensures the continual development of new electronically and sterically modified versions with even greater catalytic potential."

The mixture is observed to turn from a white to slightly yellow turbid solution. (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Experimental set-up and addition of (2S,3R)-noscapine\nThe flask is then lowered into a pre-heated oil bath maintained at 50 \u00b0C (Note 6) with the internal temperature monitored throughout the reaction via the thermometer. The mixture forms a yellow mixture upon heating and dissolves completely at 38 \u00b0C. During the reaction, a series of color changes are observed: the solution changes color from yellow to brown, then brown to red, and finally red to yellow (Note 7). Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture consists of a yellow solution and a white precipitate, which gradually forms during the course of the reaction (Note 8) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Yellow solution and white precipitate upon completion of the reaction\nNo more starting material is observed by TLC (Note 9) after 1.5 h, and the reaction flask is removed from oil bath and cooled to 25 \u00b0C. A 1-L filter flask is equipped with a sintered glass Bu\u0308chner funnel (150 mL, 6.7 cm diameter, coarse porosity) and connected to a vacuum source (5 mmHg, 24 \u00b0C) for filtration. The mixture is poured through the filtration set-up to remove the precipitate. The collected precipitate is washed with distilled water (3 x 5 mL) and eventually discarded. The Bu\u0308chner funnel is then removed and the 1-L filter flask containing the yellow filtrate is submerged in an ice-water bath (0 \u00b0C). A large magnetic stir bar (polygon, 51 x 8 mm Teflon-coated) is added to the filter flask along with a thermometer to monitor the internal reaction temperature, and continuous stirring is initiated (200 rpm). A 150-mL addition funnel containing an 40% (wt/wt) aqueous solution of KOH (140 mL) (Note 10) is positioned over the filter flask and the KOH solution is added dropwise over 25 min (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. KOH addition to the filtrate\nAn exotherm is observed upon addition of the KOH solution, thus the ice-water bath is employed to maintain the temperature \u2264 20 \u00b0C. A precipitate (the desired product) is formed over the course of the reaction. Upon reaching a pH = 11, the reaction is deemed complete as no additional precipitation is observed (Note 11). A sintered glass Bu\u0308chner funnel (150 mL, 6.8 cm diameter, coarse porosity) is fitted to a 1-L filter flask and equipped for vacuum filtration. The reaction mixture is poured through the filtration set-up to collect the crude yellow precipitate. The crude yellow solid is washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) distilled water (4 x 5 mL), followed by additional washes with water (4 x 10-mL (60 mL total). The yellow microcrystalline product is dried under high vacuum (1.8 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) for 3 h to afford 9.85 g (87 %) of cotarnine (1) (Figure 4). The obtained product is highly pure (>99%) as established by qNMR and is used directly for Step B (Notes 12 and 13).\nFigure 4. Isolated cotarnine (1)",

The flask is immersed in a 23 \u00b0C water bath and the geranyl bromide solution added dropwise over 10 min to the vigorously stirring suspension (Figure 1A). After complete addition, the grey, heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 1.5 h at 23 \u00b0C under an atmosphere of nitrogen, at which time stirring is stopped and excess zinc allowed to settle.

A) Preparation of allyl zinc reagent (left); B) Addition of allyl zinc reagent to benzoyl chloride via cannula (right) (photo provided by submitter)\nThe benzoyl chloride containing flask is immersed in an ice/water bath and the supernatant zinc reagent solution is added via a cannula at a rate that kept the internal temperature below 5-6 \u00b0C (Figure 1B). After addition is complete, the flask is maintained in the ice/water bath and the slightly cloudy solution is stirred for 30 min under an atmosphere of nitrogen until full conversion of starting material occurs, as judged by TLC (Note 5). An aqueous saturated NH4Cl solution (50 mL) and deionized water (50 mL) are added sequentially. After the ice/water bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 10 min, the biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the reaction flask rinsed with EtOAc (3 x 10 mL), which is added to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated, extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL) and the combined organic layers concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (100 mmHg, bath temperature 40 \u00b0C).

The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 (75 g), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (100 mmHg, bath temperature 40 \u00b0C) and then with a vacuum pump (0.5-1 mmHg) (Note 7). The crude residue is transferred into a 100-mL round-bottomed flask (Note 8) and distilled using a short-path distillation apparatus under vacuum (0.5-1 mmHg) (Figure 2) (Note 9).

            "Alkenes harboring allylic heteroatoms are a ubiquitous functional arrangement in organic molecules.2,3,4 Their enantioselective synthesis under mild conditions is of broad utility for the preparation of many biologically active and complex organic structures. One opportunity for such enantioselective syntheses is the use of nucleophilic heteroatom species in allylic substitution reactions of prochiral alkenes containing allylic leaving groups. Palladium(II) catalysts are ideal reagents for these transformations because of their chemoselectivity as \u03c0-acids,5 with catalyst complexes having planar chirality proven to be particularly effective for achieving antarafacial nucleopalladation of C-C double bonds.6 Our group has utilized a family of chiral cobalt oxazoline palladacycle (COP) catalysts (Figure 1), originally discovered by Richards,6a for the activation of alkenes for enantioselective nucleopalladation/deoxypalladation rearrangement and allylic substitution reactions.7,8 In 2007, we reported scalable syntheses of the three COP complexes depicted in Figure 1,9 as they had proven to be excellent catalysts for the transformation of prochiral allylic trichloroacetimidates to either branched allylic trichloroacetamides or branched allylic esters in good yields and enantioselectivities (Scheme 1).10 Although some attempts have been made to replicate the effectiveness of the COP catalysts with less elaborate ligand scaffolds, the COP complexes remain the most selective catalysts for these transformations.6c,7 High enantioselectivities, essentially complete selectivity for formation of the branched allylic product, and mild reaction conditions that tolerate most functional groups-notably those that are base labile-are typical of COP-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions.10,12 These features provide the COP family of catalysts with complementary reactivity to many catalytic enantioselective allylic functionalizations that proceed via \u03c0-allyl intermediates.13\nFigure 1. The COP family of catalysts\nAt the time of our report of the syntheses of the COP complexes, only the enantioselective trichloroacetimidate rearrangement and allylic substitution with carboxylic acid nucleophiles had been described (Scheme 1). In the following years, a number of new COP-catalyzed transformations and synthetic applications of the allylic products have been reported. These advances will be the focus of this Addendum.14\nScheme 1. Applications of COP catalysts in allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement and allylic ester synthesis\n(I) Rearrangements\nAdditional transformations involving formal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements of 1,3-dihetero-1,5-hexadienes catalyzed by COP catalysts have been reported. It has been found that the complex [COP-Cl]2 , having bridging chloride ligands, is generally the optimal catalyst for these applications.\nThe enantioselective synthesis of allylic thiocarbamates by the palladium-catalyzed rearrangement of carbamothioates has been described by our and the Clayden research groups (Scheme 2).15,16 Typical of this family of palladium-catalyzed rearrangements, the substrate scope was fairly broad and included unprotected alcohols and secondary carbamates. Clayden extended this chemistry by utilizing a subsequent lithiation/Smiles-type rearrangement to enable the synthesis of fully-substituted sulfur stereocenters. This tactic overcame the inability of the COP complexes to catalyze rearrangements of allylic precursors having two substituents at the site of C-S bond formation. The stereoselectivity of this two-step sequence was generally high, with the configuration of the newly formed stereocenter being determined by the enantioselectivity of the COP-catalyzed rearrangement.15\nScheme 2. Enantioselective rearrangements of allylic carbamothioates\nThe enantioselective introduction of nitrogen-containing stereocenters by COP-catalyzed allylic rearrangements has been extended to allylic alcohol precursors other than trichloroacetimidates. Batey recognized the opportunity to utilize 2\u2011allyloxypyridines as imidate surrogates in palladium-catalyzed rearrangements using COP complexes (Scheme 3).17 These transformations provide N-allylpyridones in good yields and enantioselectivities using [COP-Cl]2. It was found that generation of a cationic complex by removal of the chloride ligands with silver trifluoroacetate significantly enhanced the rate of the rearrangement without reduction in enantioselectivity. Batey also demonstrated that other allyloxy-substituted nitrogen heterocycles, including quinolines and benzothiazoles, could be transformed in a similar fashion to N-allylated products in good yields and enantioselectivities. In addition, Batey reported the COP-catalyzed rearrangement of iminodiazaphospholidines to provide chiral allylic phosphoramides, which upon reaction with 1 M HCl gave the corresponding allylic tosylamide.18 In the presence of silver trifluoroacetate and [COP-Cl]2, this rearrangement proceeded in moderate to good yields and modest to high enantioselectivities. As a method for enantioselective synthesis of chiral amines, the COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement has a broader scope and provides products readily converted to the corresponding primary amine.\nScheme 3. Enantioselective rearrangements to generate C-N bonds: allyloxypyridines and iminodiazapholidines\nThe typically broad scope, mild conditions, and high enantioselectivity of COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangements has led to this reaction being employed as a key step in the enantioselective construction of various nitrogen-containing molecules (Scheme 4). A common tactic is to strategically combine this reaction with ruthenium-catalyzed alkene cross-metathesis or ring-forming metathesis. For example, Han followed the COP-catalyzed enantioselective rearrangement of an allylic alcohol with an aminomercuration/demercuration reaction to construct 2,6-disubstituted piperidines.19 Cross metathesis was then employed to append a 2-octanone side chain to yield, after alkene hydrogenation, the CNS-active piperidine alkaloid (+)-iso-6-cassine. Combining COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangements with ring-closing metathesis (RCM) to construct nitrogen heterocycles was reported by Aldrich and Richards.20,21 After palladium-catalyzed rearrangement, both strategies appended an allyl or homoallyl group to the resulting nitrogen. Ruthenium-catalyzed RCM of the resulting dienes provided the targeted heterocycles. Aldrich utilized this strategy to construct a piperidinone inhibitor of biotin synthesis. Richards was able to synthesize a number of functionalized enantioenriched piperidines, pyrrolidines, quinolizidines, and indolizidines, including the natural products anisomycin and coniine. Sutherland also employed a palladium-catalyzed rearrangement/RCM strategy on dienol starting materials to construct amine-substituted carbocycles that were then elaborated to polyhydroxylated aminocarbocycles.22\nScheme 4. Applications of [COP-Cl]2-catalyzed rearrangements in synthesis\n(I) Rearrangements\nOne other important use of the COP family of catalysts is to promote enantioselective SN2'-type reactions of prochiral allylic imidates. Our original report of the intermolecular allylic esterification motivated us and others to pursue the utility of other nucleophiles in the enantioselective synthesis of branched allylic substitution products.9c,d In general, successful nucleophiles needed to be relatively acidic (pKa <12) in order to participate in the S N2' reactions. This requirement is particularly important for intermolecular reactivity and presumably results from the need to eventually protonate the imidate leaving group. Furthermore, intermolecular substitutions catalyzed by the COP family of catalysts require the use of the Z-allylic imidate in order to suppress competing [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement by increasing the steric demand of the intramolecular iminopalladation step.\nPhenols were quickly found to be particularly useful nucleophiles for the generation of allyl aryl ethers (Scheme 5).23 SN2' substitution onto prochiral Z\u2011allylic imidates provided the corresponding allyl aryl ethers in good yields and consistently high enantioselectivities. As in the synthesis of allylic esters, the palladacyclic complex [COP-OAc]2 was ideal for this transformation of the Z-allylic imidates. In the course of these studies, a new complex, [COP\u2011NHCOCCl3]2, was discovered in which the bridging acetate ligands were replaced by bridging trichloroacetamidates.24 This complex was the first catalyst capable of promoting the intermolecular SN2' substitutions of E-allylic imidates. For reasons still not well understood, [COP-NHCOCCl3]2 is a comparatively poor catalyst for the allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, allowing useful yields of allyl aryl ethers to be produced without the formation of significant amounts of allyl amide byproducts. Unfortunately, this reactivity could not be translated to the allylic esterification, as [COP-NHCOCCl3] 2 readily converts to a carboxylate-ligated species in the presence of carboxylic acids.12 These carboxylate complexes, like [COP-OAc]2, are also competent catalysts for the competing allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement.\nScheme 5. Enantioselective intermolecular SN2' reactions with phenol nucleophiles\nCatalytic, enantioselective, intramolecular substitution reactions with phenol nucleophiles were also realized with [COP-OAc]2 (Scheme 6).25 Vinylchromans and other oxygen heterocycles were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities. In particular, E-alkenes were found to be the ideal substrates, as the corresponding Z isomers provided products having significantly reduced enantioselectivities. This intramolecular reactivity allowed two firsts for the COP family of complexes: (1) the stereoselective synthesis of fully-substituted stereocenters in good enantioselectivity, albeit in low yield; and (2) the use of allylic acetates as effective and more atom-economical leaving groups giving allylic substitution products in comparable yields and enantioselectivities. In this latter case, basic potassium fluoride was required to promote the reaction.\nScheme 6. Enantioselective synthesis of 2-vinyl substituted oxygen heterocycles\nJirgensons also reported a COP-catalyzed intramolecular substitution of allylic bis-trichloroacetamidates (Scheme 7).26 In this case, the E-alkene stereoisomer of the bisimidate was required to achieve high yield and diastereoselectivity.\nScheme 7. Synthesis of a vinyloxazoline by a [COP-Cl]2-catalyzed substitution reaction\nThe allylic substitution reaction has found some use in total synthesis efforts. For instance, Kirsch demonstrated an iterative approach for the synthesis of 1,3-polyols.27 This strategy utilizes a ring-closing metathesis to generate a 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrone intermediate. Conversion of this lactone to theZ-allylic imidate allowed for a subsequent COP-catalyzed S N2' reaction to establish the next stereocenter. Kirsch demonstrated that this method could be used to construct all of the possible stereoisomers of 1,3-polyols with high levels of catalyst control, providing programmed access to polyketide scaffolds. Kirsch employed this iterative approach to synthesize polyrhacitides A and B.28 Kirsch also utilized the [COP-OAc]2-catalyzed allylic ester synthesis in his syntheses of rugulactone and chloriolide.27b\nScheme 8. Iterative strategy for 1,3-polyols utilizing COP-catalyzed SN2' reactions\nConclusion\nSeveral advances in the utility of the COP family of palladacyclic catalysts have been realized in recent years. These catalysts have proven to be relatively general enantioselective catalysts for both bimolecular and intramolecular allylic substitution reactions involving heteropalladation/deoxypalladation steps. We anticipate that these complexes will continue to find use in similar reactions where mild conditions and high selectivity for forming the branched product are paramount."
