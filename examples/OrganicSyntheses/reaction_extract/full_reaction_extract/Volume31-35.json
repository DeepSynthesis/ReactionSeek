            "A 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient condenser, the upper end of which is protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. In this flask 23 g. (1 g. atom) of lustrous sodium (Note 1) is dissolved in 400 ml. of absolute ethanol (Note 2). The sodium is cut into about 25 pieces, and the entire amount is added at one time. It may be necessary to cool the flask in a cold-water bath if the reaction becomes violent. When all the sodium has dissolved, the solution is cooled to 50\u00b0 and 130 g. (127 ml., 1 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate (Note 3) is added dropwise while the temperature is maintained between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0. The resulting solution is cooled to about 35\u00b0, and 92.5 g. (78.4 ml., 1 mole) of epichlorohydrin (Note 4) is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 20 minutes. The temperature is then raised to 45\u00b0 and is kept at 45\u201350\u00b0 for 18 hours. The clear red-orange solution is cooled to 15\u00b0, and chilled glacial acetic acid (60\u201365 ml.) is added with stirring until the solution is just acid to litmus; a mush of sodium acetate crystals precipitates. The dropping funnel is replaced by a capillary tube, and the condenser is set for distillation. About three-fourths of the ethanol is removed under reduced pressure while air is bubbled into the mixture through the capillary tube (Note 5). Care is taken that the internal temperature does not exceed 100\u00b0.\nThe mushy residue is shaken with 250\u2013300 ml. of water until the sodium acetate dissolves. The oily layer of lactone is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are washed with 150 ml. of water and dried overnight over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed under reduced pressure, and the product is distilled from a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 160\u2013170\u00b0/11 mm. is collected; refractionation yields 107\u2013114 g. (61\u201364%) of product boiling at 164\u2013168\u00b0/11 mm. or 151\u2013156\u00b0/8 mm.; n25D 1.4815\u20131.4830 (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

            "A solution of 368 g. of 96% sulfuric acid in 664 ml. of water is cooled to room temperature and placed in a 3-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. To this acid solution is added 114 g. (1 mole) of 2-methylcyclohexanol (Note 1). A mixture of 220 g. (2.2 moles) of chromic oxide (Note 2) in 368 g. of 96% sulfuric acid and 664 ml. of water is added from the dropping funnel to the 2-methylcyclohexanol suspension at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture remains at 30 \u00b1 2\u00b0 (Note 3). Good agitation and an ice bath are necessary to control the temperature in this range. The mixture is stirred at 30 \u00b1 2\u00b0 for 1 hour and then at room temperature until all the chromic oxide is consumed (Note 4). The sulfuric acid solution is extracted with ether until the returns from the ether extractions fall to an insignificant amount. Approximately 10 extractions with 200-ml. portions of ether are required (Note 5). The ether extracts are combined, and the ether is removed by distillation on the steam bath. The resulting crude \u03b4-acetyl-n-valeric acid is a yellow liquid with a sharp odor and amounts to about 130 g. The crude acid is purified by distillation through a 30-in. Vigreux column, using a variable take-off, a reflux ratio of 3:1, and a pressure of 1 mm. A fore-run of approximately 30 g. of material distilling up to 122\u00b0/1 mm. is obtained. The main fraction which distils at 122\u2013123\u00b0/1 mm. is pure \u03b4-acetyl-n-valeric acid and amounts to 66\u201379 g. (46\u201355%). The pure acid is a colorless crystalline hygroscopic solid which melts (sealed capillary) at 34\u201335\u00b0 and is miscible with water in all proportions. The literature records the melting point of \u03b4-acetyl-n-valeric acid as ranging from 31\u00b0 to 42\u00b0.2,3,4"

(0.36 mole) of p-nitrotoluene (Note 2) in 300 ml. of 95% ethanol. A reflux condenser is attached, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 3 hours. The resulting clear but deep red solution is rapidly steam-distilled until about 1.5\u20132 l. of condensate has been collected (Note 3). The distillate should be clear when the distillation is stopped. The residue in the 2-l. flask should have a volume of 500\u2013600 ml.; if less, it should be diluted to this volume with boiling water. The solution is rapidly chilled in an ice bath with occasional vigorous shaking and stirring to induce crystallization. After 2 hours in the ice bath the golden yellow crystals of p-aminobenzaldehyde are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 500 ml. of ice water to remove sodium hydroxide (Note 4). The product is immediately placed in a vacuum desiccator over solid potassium hydroxide pellets for 24 hours. The yield of p-aminobenzaldehyde, m.p. 68\u201370\u00b0, amounts to 18\u201322 g.

The reaction mixture, from which large quantities of lead sulfide separate instantly, is boiled for 6 minutes and cooled to 0\u00b0, and the lead sulfide is filtered with suction by means of a large B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 2). The colorless filtrate is acidified at 0\u20135\u00b0 (Note 3) by the slow addition with stirring of 120\u2013140 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The white crystalline precipitate of nearly pure o-chlorophenylcyanamide which separates is collected by filtration on a suction filter and is washed with six 150-ml. portions of ice water. The crystalline mass of white plates is filtered, drained, and dried (Note 4). The yield of product, melting at 100\u2013104\u00b0, is 26\u201328 g. (85\u201392%).\nRecrystallization from benzene-light petroleum ether (8 ml. and 4 ml. respectively per gram of the dried precipitated material) gives lustrous needles of o-chlorophenylcyanamide, m.p. 105\u2013106\u00b0 (60\u201370% recovery) (Note 5). The above method is generally applicable and affords an excellent route to arylcyanamides (Note 6)."

(1 mole) of 2,3-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (Note 3), and 400 ml. of pyridine. The malonic acid is dissolved by shaking and warming on a steam bath (Note 4). Piperidine (15 ml.) is then added, the reflux condenser and thermometer are fitted into place (Note 5), and the mixture is heated to 80\u00b0. About 30 minutes should be allowed for this rise in temperature. An internal temperature of 80\u201385\u00b0 is maintained for 1 hour, and the material is finally heated under reflux (109\u2013115\u00b0) for an additional 3 hours (Note 6).\nAfter being cooled the reaction mixture is poured into a large beaker containing 4 l. of cold water. The mixture is acidified by slowly adding with stirring 500 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid; it should be strongly acidic at this point. The light-brown crystals are separated by suction filtration and washed 4 times with 150-ml. portions of cold water. The crude acid is dissolved in a solution of 80 g. of sodium hydroxide in 3 l. of water. The resulting is filtered, diluted with an additional 1.2 l. of water, and acidified by adding with stirring 600 ml. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid. The mixture is filtered, and the crystalline material is washed with three 150-ml. portions of cold water. The product is dried at 60\u201370\u00b0 (Note 7). The yield is 180\u2013205 g. (87\u201398%), m.p. 174\u2013178\u00b0 (Note 8). Further purification is usually not necessary, but it may be accomplished by recrystallization from methyl ethyl ketone, using 12 ml. of solvent per gram of acid. The hot solution is filtered rapidly through a steam-heated B\u00fcchner funnel and chilled for several hours. A recovery of 70% of product, m.p. 179\u2013180\u00b0, may be obtained."

After all the \u03b2-dimethylaminoethanol has been added, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for another hour (Note 5). The temperature of the mixture is 35\u201350\u00b0. At this point the reaction mixture consists of a brown semisolid slush of the desired product together with a slight excess of thionyl chloride.\nThe entire contents of the reaction flask are transferred to a 2-l. beaker (or wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask) containing approximately 1 l. of absolute ethanol (Note 6). The resulting brown solution is heated to boiling on a hot plate, during which time there is a copious evolution of gases (Note 6).

To this solution 1250 g. of ice is added, and a stream of chlorine is passed in rapidly through a delivery tube having a small opening and extending almost to the bottom of the liquid. The passage of the chlorine is continued until 161 g. (2.27 moles) has been absorbed. The flask is then fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 500-ml. separatory funnel.\nSeventy grams (0.5 mole) of methone2 is dissolved in a solution of 65 g. (1.16 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 525 ml. of water. The solution is cooled to room temperature, poured into the separatory funnel, and run slowly with stirring into the sodium hypochlorite solution. The temperature rises gradually to 35\u201340\u00b0 during the addition. After the addition has been completed, the solution is stirred for 6\u20138 hours until the temperature drops to room temperature.\nWithout interrupting the stirring, 50 g. of sodium sulfite is added to decompose the excess sodium hypochlorite, and the solution is acidified to Congo red by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid slowly with stirring to avoid foaming. The acid solution is then concentrated by distillation until salts just begin to precipitate (Note 1).\nThe mixture is then cooled to room temperature, 300 ml. of ether and enough water are added to dissolve all of the precipitate, and the whole is transferred to a 3-l. separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous portion is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and dried for several hours over 15\u201320 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is then removed by distillation. This may be conveniently carried out by fitting a 250-ml. Claisen flask with a separatory funnel in order to add the solution as the ether distils. When only 150\u2013200 ml. of solution remains in the flask, the distillation is stopped and the residue is poured into a small beaker. The remaining ether is removed by heating on a steam bath, and the residue solidifies on cooling. The colorless, crystalline \u03b2,\u03b2-dimethylglutaric acid is dried in air. The yield is 73\u201377 g. (91\u201396%), m.p. 97\u201399\u00b0. Crystallization from 100\u2013125 ml. of benzene gives 65\u201373 g. (81\u201391%) of acid, m.p. 100\u2013102\u00b0 (Note 2)."

            "A solution of sodium amide in liquid ammonia is prepared according to a procedure previously described (Note 1) in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser attached to a soda-lime tower which is connected to a gas absorption trap,2 a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and an inlet tube. Anhydrous liquid ammonia (350 ml.) is introduced through the inlet tube, and about 0.3 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate and 13.7 g. (0.59 g. atom) of freshly cut sodium are added (Note 1) and (Note 2).\nAfter the conversion of sodium to sodium amide is complete, the inlet tube is replaced with a 500-ml. dropping funnel and the flask is cooled in a bath of Dry Ice and trichloroethylene. Benzyl cyanide (69 g., 0.59 mole) (Note 3) is added dropwise with stirring during about 20 minutes. The cooling bath is removed, and the solution is stirred for an additional period of 20 minutes, after which 700 ml. of dry ether is added slowly through the dropping funnel. The solution is allowed to stand or is warmed gently with a water bath until it comes to room temperature. The rate of addition of ether and subsequent warming are controlled so that the ammonia which is vaporized passes through the gas absorption trap rather than escaping in part through the mercury seal of the stirrer. When most of the ammonia has been removed, an additional 300-ml. portion of dry ether is added (Note 4). The flask is then heated on a hot water bath. By turning off the cooling water of the reflux condenser for a short time, a small amount of ether is allowed to distil out of the reaction mixture in order to remove as much of the ammonia as possible (Note 5). The condenser water is then turned on again, and dry nitrogen lines under a positive pressure of 2\u20133 cm. of mercury (maintained by a T-tube dipping into mercury) are attached to the top of the dropping funnel and the reflux condenser. A solution of 200 g. (1.1 moles) of benzophenone (Note 6) and (Note 7) in 300 ml. of dry ether (Note 8) is added through the dropping funnel during a period of 15 minutes, and the mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 24 hours. At the end of this period the solution contains a reddish brown precipitate. The mixture is allowed to cool, and 250 ml. of water is added slowly through the dropping funnel. The aqueous and ether layers are separated in a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the water layer is filtered directly through a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The aqueous filtrate is discarded. The ether layer also is run into the funnel, and the filtrate is concentrated to a volume of about 80 ml. The solid that separates is added to the solid previously collected on the filter. The crude reddish brown product is recrystallized from 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid. \u03b1,\u03b2-Diphenylcinnamonitrile separates as white crystals which are collected on a suction filter, washed with 100 ml. of water, and dried at 110\u00b0 for 24 hours. The yield of a pure product melting at 166\u2013167\u00b0 is 83\u2013110 g. (50\u201366%)."

(3 moles) of \u03b1-acetyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone (Note 1) and a boiling chip are placed in a 2-l. distilling flask fitted with a 90-cm. bulb-type condenser and a receiver immersed in an ice water bath (Note 2). Carbon dioxide is evolved immediately. Heating of the reaction mixture is begun at once, and the temperature is raised at such a rate that the reaction mixture does not foam into the condenser. In about 10 minutes the color changes from yellow to orange to black, the effervescence begins to subside, and distillation commences. The distillation is continued as rapidly as possible (Note 3). After 900 ml. of distillate has been collected, 450 ml. of water is added to the distilling flask and another 300 ml. of distillate is collected.\nThe yellow organic layer in the distillate is separated (Note 4), and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined with the organic layer and dried for 1 hour over 25 g. of calcium chloride. A saturated calcium chloride layer forms in the bottom. The ether solution is decanted and dried with an additional 25 g. of calcium chloride. The ether is removed by distillation through a 30-cm. column packed with glass helices and fitted with a total condensation, variable take-off head. The residual crude 5-chloro-2-pentanone weighs 287\u2013325 g. (79\u201390%) (Note 5). When 290 g. of this material is fractionated through a wrapped 12-in. Vigreux column, the major portion boils at 70\u201372\u00b0/20 mm., n25D 1.4371, and weighs 258\u2013264 g. (89\u201391%).\nB. Methyl cyclopropyl ketone. A 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sweep-type stirrer made from \u00bc-in. iron rod (Note 6), a reflux condenser, and a 500-ml. dropping funnel. In the flask is placed a solution of 180 g. (4.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide pellets in 180 ml. of water. To this solution is added over a period of 15\u201320 minutes 361.5 g. (342 ml., approximately 3 moles) of the crude 5-chloro-2-pentanone (Note 7). If the reaction mixture does not begin to boil during the addition, boiling is initiated by slight heating of the flask and is continued for 1 hour. Three hundred and seventy milliliters of water is then added slowly to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period, and the mixture is heated under reflux for an additional hour.\nThe condenser is arranged for distillation, and a water-ketone mixture is distilled until all the organic layer is removed from the reaction mixture. The aqueous layer of the distillate is saturated with potassium carbonate, and the upper layer of methyl cyclopropyl ketone is separated. The aqueous layer is extraced with two 150-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts and the ketone layer are combined and dried over 25 g. of calcium chloride for 1 hour. The ether solution is decanted and dried with an additional 25 g. of calcium chloride. The dried ether solution is fractionated through the 30-cm. column described in Part A (Note 8). The yield of methyl cyclopropyl ketone, b.p. 110\u2013112\u00b0, n25D 1.4226, is 193\u2013210 g. (77\u201383%)."

The flask is immersed in a water bath at 20\u201325\u00b0, and 8 ml. (0.126 mole) of concentrated nitric acid (70% by weight, sp. gr. 1.42), essentially free of oxides of nitrogen, is added slowly from the dropping funnel with vigorous stirring. The rate of addition is controlled so that the reaction temperature does not exceed 30\u00b0. About 15\u201320 minutes is required for this step.\nAfter all the nitric acid has been added, the mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained (about 30 minutes), and stirring is then continued for an additional 30 minutes. The solution is filtered to remove any anthracene, and a mixture of 50 ml.

            "A well-stirred (Note 1) and (Note 2) mixture of 740 ml. of glycerol and 216 g. of boric acid, in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer and a condenser for downward distillation, is dehydrated by heating in an oil bath to exactly 170\u00b0. This temperature is maintained for 30 minutes and then allowed to drop. When the temperature has fallen to 150\u00b0, a mixture of 154 g. (1 mole) of pyrogallol-1,3-dimethyl ether and 154 g. (1.1 moles) of hexamethylenetetramine (Note 3) is added as rapidly as possible through the neck holding the thermometer. The temperature drops to approximately 125\u00b0. Rapid heating is immediately started but is slowed down when the temperature begins to reach 145\u00b0 and stopped at 148\u00b0. The reaction must be watched and controlled very carefully when this temperature is reached, since the reaction becomes exothermic at this point (Note 4), (Note 5), and (Note 6). The temperature is maintained at 150\u2013160\u00b0 for approximately 6 minutes (Note 7). At the end of this reaction time the mixture is cooled to 110\u00b0 as rapidly as possible (Note 6) and (Note 8), and a previously prepared solution of 184 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 620 ml. of water is added to the reaction mixture. After being stirred for 1 hour, the mixture is cooled to 25\u00b0 in an ice bath. The boric acid, which separates from the solution, is removed by filtration (Note 9) and washed free of mother liquor with 400 ml. of water. The filtrate and washings are combined and extracted with three 500-ml. portions of chloroform (Note 10), (Note 11), and (Note 12).\nThe chloroform solution is then extracted with a filtered solution of 180 g. of sodium bisulfite in 720 ml. of water (Note 13) by stirring rapidly with a Hershberg stirrer for 1 hour. The separated bisulfite solution is washed twice with chloroform, filtered, and acidified in a hood with a solution of 55 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 55 ml. of water. After careful heating on a steam bath for a short time, air is bubbled through the hot solution until all the sulfur dioxide has been expelled. The product, which separates as a mixture of crystals and oil, readily solidifies upon cooling (Note 14). The syringic aldehyde is collected by filtration, washed with cold water, and dried in an oven at 40\u00b0 to give 62.5\u201366 g. of light-tan material, melting at 110.5\u2013111\u00b0, which still contains a small amount of foreign material that does not melt at 300\u00b0. Recrystallization of the crude product from aqueous methanol using 30 ml. of water and 3 ml. of methanol for each 10 g. of aldehyde gives 56\u201359 g. (31\u201332%) of product melting clear at 111\u2013112\u00b0 (uncor.). A second extraction of the chloroform solution with a filtered solution of 60 g. of sodium bisulfite in 240 ml. of water gives an additional 3\u20134 g. of product."

            "A. 3,5-Dichloro-2-aminobenzoic acid. A solution of 45 g. (0.33 mole) of anthranilic acid, 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 850 ml. of water is placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask in a hood and weighed. While the solution is stirred rapidly, chlorine is introduced until the reaction mixture gains 45 g. (0.63 mole) in weight (Note 1). The flask is surrounded by a water bath to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture below 30\u00b0 during the chlorination procedure. The reaction mixture is filtered by suction, using a large (10\u201312 in.) B\u00fcchner funnel; the crude product is washed with water and then dried at room temperature (Note 2). There is obtained 55\u201365 g. of crude product melting at about 205\u00b0. The crude product is leached with 4 ml. of boiling benzene per gram, filtered by suction, and washed on the filter with 1 ml. of cold benzene per gram. After drying at room temperature, there is obtained 46.5\u201353 g. (69\u201378%) of crude 3,5-dichloro-2-aminobenzoic acid. The melting point of this material should not be lower than 211\u00b0 (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nB. Diazotization of 3,5-dichloro-2-aminobenzoic acid. Fifty grams (0.24 mole) of 3,5-dichloro-2-aminobenzoic acid is dissolved in a solution of 12 g. (0.3 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 700 ml. of water. To this solution is added 20 g. (0.29 mole) of sodium nitrite, and the solution is cooled to 10\u00b0 (Note 5). One hundred milliliters of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.191) and 200 ml. of water are placed in a 2-l three-necked flask and cooled to 10\u00b0. The cold solution of sodium 3,5-dichloro-2-aminobenzoate and sodium nitrite is then added to the hydrochloric acid solution with cooling (10\u00b0) and efficient stirring at such a rate that no appreciable accumulation of undiazotized amine results (Note 6). At the conclusion of the diazotization, the resulting solution is stirred a few minutes with 2 g. of diatomaceous earth and filtered by suction (Note 7).\nC. Preparation of the reducing agent. One hundred and twenty-five grams (0.5 mole) of cupric sulfate pentahydrate is dissolved in 500 ml. of water contained in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, and then 210 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added with stirring. The solution is cooled to 10\u00b0. A solution of 40 g. (0.57 mole) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 140 ml. of water is prepared and also cooled to 10\u00b0. To the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution there is added 95 ml. of 6N sodium hydroxide solution, and if not entirely clear, it is filtered by suction. This hydroxylamine solution is immediately added to the ammoniacal cupric sulfate solution with stirring. Reduction occurs at once with the evolution of nitrogen, and the solution becomes pale blue. If this solution is not used at once, it should be protected from the air.\nD. dl-4,4',6,6'-Tetrachlorodiphenic acid. The reducing solution prepared above is cooled to 10\u00b0 and maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0 during the addition of the diazo solution from Part B, which is added from dropping funnel. A feed tube having a 2-mm. opening and dipping well below the surface of the reducing solution should be attached to the stem of the dropping funnel. The feed tube should be bent upward at the end and so placed that mixing of the reducing solution occurs rapidly (Note 8). The diazo solution is added at approximately 25 ml. per minute, and excessive foaming is suppressed by the addition of small amounts of ether (Note 9). At the conclusion of the reaction (Note 10), the ammoniacal solution is transferred to two 4-l. beakers, heated to 80\u201390\u00b0, and rapidly acidified to litmus with concentrated hydrochloric acid with vigorous stirring (Note 11). At this point acidification is continued more carefully until the solution is acid to Congo red (Note 12). A total excess of 100 ml. of acid is then added, and the solution is allowed to stand overnight. The product is filtered by suction and washed on the filter with four 250-ml. portions of water. After drying, the yield of crude product, melting at 180\u2013215\u00b0, is 29\u201338.5 g. (63\u201384%).\nThe crude product is dissolved in 3.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid per gram, heated with stirring to 150\u00b0 for 5 minutes, and allowed to cool overnight. The resulting product is filtered by suction through a sintered-glass funnel and washed on the filter with three 15-ml. portions of concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature. The filter cake is removed from the funnel and boiled with 50 ml. of water to remove adherent sulfuric acid. The product is then filtered and dried. The above procedure yields 19\u201322 g. (41\u201348%) of almost colorless dl-4,4'6,6'-tetrachlorodiphenic acid melting at 243\u2013250\u00b0 (uncor.) (Note 13). Pure acid may be obtained by a second recrystallization from concentrated sulfuric acid. Twenty grams of crude dl-4,4',6,6'-tetrachlorodiphenic acid, m.p. 243\u00b0, recrystallized from 70 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid yields 6.54 g. (33% recovery) of colorless product melting at 258\u2013259\u00b0."

(11 moles) of 99.5% paraformaldehyde (Note 1), and 1.8 l. of water is placed in a 5-l. flask equipped with a thermometer and an efficient stirrer. The mixture is cooled to 10\u201315\u00b0 by an ice-water bath, and 70 g. (1.25 moles) of calcium oxide is added through a powder funnel over a period of 10\u201315 minutes. The temperature is allowed to rise slowly to 40\u00b0 and is kept there by means of the cooling bath until the addition is complete. Stirring is maintained throughout. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes. During this time the temperature usually falls to approximately 35\u00b0, and at this point the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is then made slightly acid (pH 6\u20136.5) by the addition of 11\u201313 ml. of aqueous 87% formic acid. It is best to stir the reaction mixture for 30 minutes after neutralization in order to make sure that any suspended particles of lime are neutralized. If at the end of this time the solution is not acid, more formic acid should be added. The reaction mixture is then evaporated under reduced pressure to dryness (Note 2). The residue, which consists of a mixture of product and calcium formate, is mixed with 1 l. of absolute methanol. On warming, the organic material dissolves and the calcium formate settles to the bottom of the flask. A practically colorless solution of the product is obtained by filtration with suction (Note 3) through a heated funnel. The insoluble calcium formate is washed with about 50 ml. of methanol. Approximately one-half of the methanol is removed under reduced pressure, and the residual syrupy solution (Note 4) is allowed to crystallize in an ice chest for 24 hours. Thereafter the product is filtered and washed with 50 ml. of methanol. The mother liquor and washings are combined and set aside. With a mortar and pestle, the crystals are triturated successively with three 200\u2013300-ml. portions of acetone, filtered, and air-dried. By continued evaporation of the mother liquor and washings, at least two successive crops of product are obtained, and these are processed as described above (Note 5). The total yield of product melting at 128\u2013129\u00b0 is 320\u2013374 g. (73\u201385%). Recrystallization of 100 g. of material, m.p. 128\u2013129\u00b0, from 175 ml. of absolute methanol yields 84 g. of pure product melting at 129\u2013130\u00b0."

            "A 200-ml. three-necked flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed glass stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a gas inlet tube and thermometer, both of which extend into the lower half of the flask. The top of the condenser is connected to a mercury bubbler tube, and the gas inlet tube is attached to the inlet tube of a gas-washing bottle which serves as a safety trap to prevent liquid from being drawn into the hydrogen sulfide source. The gas-washing bottle is connected through a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite) to a T-tube. The vertical arm of the T-tube dips into mercury and forms a safety valve; the other arm is connected to a commercial cylinder (Note 1) or other source of hydrogen sulfide. To the flask are added 107 g. (100 ml., 1 mole) of 95% acetic anhydride and 1 g. (0.025 mole) of powdered sodium hydroxide. The assembly of the flask, condenser, inlet tube, and thermometer is weighed and arranged so that the amount of hydrogen sulfide introduced can be determined by subsequent weighing. The stirrer is started, and hydrogen sulfide is passed into the mixture as rapidly as possible without much loss of the gas through the bubbler connected to the top of the condenser. The temperature of the mixture rises to 55\u00b0 within 30 minutes and is kept at 50\u201355\u00b0 by intermittent cooling. The temperature begins to drop after 14\u201317 g. of hydrogen sulfide has been absorbed and is maintained at 50\u201355\u00b0 by external heating. After a total reaction period of 6 hours, hydrogen sulfide ceases to be absorbed and the gain in weight amounts to about 31 g.\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a 250-ml. Claisen flask (Note 2) and distilled rapidly at 200 mm. in order to separate the sodium salts (Note 3). The distillate of thiolacetic acid and acetic acid, b.p. 35\u201382\u00b0/200 mm., amounts to 120\u2013124 g. It is fractionally distilled at atmospheric pressure through an efficient, variable take-off type column2 with a 30- to 40-cm. section packed with glass helices. The fraction boiling at 86\u201388\u00b0, n25D 1.4612, is nearly pure thiolacetic acid and amounts to 55\u201357.5 g. (72\u201376%) based on the acetic anhydride (Note 4) and (Note 5). The residual liquid is mainly acetic acid. If distillation is continued after separation of the thiolacetic acid, the vapor temperature rises rapidly to the boiling point of acetic acid."

            "The reaction is carried out in a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with ground-glass joints and equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a calcium chloride tube. In the flask are placed 135 g. (1.0 mole) of N-methylformanilide (Note 1) and 153 g. (91 ml., 1.0 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 30 minutes (Note 2). Mechanical stirring is then begun, and the flask is immersed in a cold-water bath while 92.4 g. (1.1 moles) of thiophene is added at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at 25\u201335\u00b0 (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred 2 hours longer at the same temperature and is then allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 hours. The dark, viscous solution is poured into a vigorously stirred mixture of 400 g. of cracked ice and 250 ml. of water. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with three 300-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined with the organic layer and washed twice with 200-ml. portions of dilute hydrochloric acid (Note 4) to remove all traces of N-methylaniline (Note 5). These aqueous washings are in turn extracted with 200 ml. of ether, and the ether extract is added to the ether solution of the product. The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 200-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 6), then with 100 ml. of water, and finally are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The yellow oil obtained by concentrating the ether solution is distilled from a 100-ml. flask fitted with a satisfactory column (Note 7). The yield of 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde boiling at 97\u2013100\u00b0/27 mm., nD23 1.5893, is 80\u201383 g. (71\u201374%). The product darkens on standing."

(0.74 mole) of N-grade wood rosin (Note 1), 740 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 42 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). A stream of carbon dioxide is passed over the surface of the solution by means of a glass tube which extends downward through the condenser during this reaction (Note 2). The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 hours (Note 3). At the end of this time, the ethanol and acid are removed by steam distillation and the water is decanted. The residue is cooled to room temperature and dissolved in 1 l. of ether. The ether solution is extracted with water and dried over 200 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The bulk of the ether is evaporated on the steam bath, and the last traces are removed by fusing the rosin over a free flame and under a vacuum furnished by a water aspirator. The molten rosin, blanketed continuously with carbon dioxide, is most conveniently handled by being poured into a paper boat; yield 245 g.; [\u03b1]D24 \u221235\u00b0 (Note 4).\nThe isomerized rosin, 245 g. (0.72 mole) (Note 1), is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 375 ml. of acetone by heating the mixture on a steam bath. To this solution, at incipient boiling, is added slowly and with vigorous agitation (Note 5) 127 g. (0.81 mole) of diamylamine2 (Note 6). Upon cooling to room temperature, crystals appear in the form of rosettes. The mass is agitated, cooled well in an ice bath, and filtered by suction. The crystalline salt is washed on a B\u00fcchner funnel with 150 ml. of acetone and dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0 for 1 hour. The optical rotation of this material is [\u03b1]D24 \u221218\u00b0 (Note 4). The solid is recrystallized four times from acetone. Each time a sufficient quantity (20 ml. per g.) of acetone is used to obtain complete solution, and the solvent is evaporated until incipient precipitation of the salt occurs. The yield of product is 118 g.; [\u03b1]D24 \u221260\u00b0 (Note 4). An additional 29 g. of product, having the same rotation, can be recovered from filtrates of the previous crystallizations.\nThe amine salt (147 g.) is placed in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 1 l. of 95% ethanol by heating the mixture on a steam bath. To the solution, which has been cooled to room temperature (Note 7), is added 39 g. (35.8 ml.) of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is stirred. Water (900 ml.) is added cautiously at first and with vigorous agitation until crystals of abietic acid begin to appear; the remainder of the water is then added more rapidly. The abietic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 8) and washed with water until the acetic acid has been removed completely as indicated by tests with indicator paper. Recrystallization can be effected by dissolving the crude product in 700 ml. of 95% ethanol, adding 600 ml. of water as described above, and cooling the solution. The yield of abietic acid is 98 g.

When all the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is maintained at 60\u201370\u00b0 for an additional 20 minutes. The temperature is raised to about 85\u00b0, 10 g. of Norit is added cautiously, and the solution is filtered by suction through a previously heated B\u00fcchner funnel.\nIn a 4-l. beaker equipped with a stirrer which can be operated above the liquid level to break the foam are placed 250 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid and 250 ml. of water. The filtrate obtained above is cooled to about 50\u00b0 and is added to the hydrochloric acid in small portions and at such a rate that the mixture does not foam over. If efficient stirring is used in the foam layer, this addition can be carried out in 5 minutes. The product is isolated by filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel and is washed on the filter, first with a 250-ml. portion of dilute hydrochloric acid (prepared by diluting 50 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid to about 250 ml.) to remove anthranilic acid, and then with 500 ml. of water.

The benzene is best removed by vacuum distillation using a water aspirator (Note 5). The grainy, brown, crude product is separated by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed thoroughly with dilute hydrochloric acid, with water, then with two 500-ml. portions of 5% sodium carbonate (to remove anthranilic acid and starting material), and finally with three 500-ml. portions of water (Note 6). The filter cake is sucked reasonably dry.\nThe crude, moist sulfonamide is dissolved in 1.6 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid by warming on the steam bath for 15 minutes. The sulfuric acid solution is divided into two equal parts, each of which is placed in a 4-l. beaker. The beakers are cooled in ice baths while 1.6 kg. of ice is added slowly and with stirring to the contents of each beaker. During the addition of the ice, phenyl p-tolyl sulfone separates. A total of 50 g. of Norit is added, and the solution is filtered (Note 7) and (Note 8).\nThe filtrates are best neutralized separately. Two 5-gal. crocks are half filled with crushed ice, and one-half of the total filtrate is poured into each. For neutralization, commercial 12N ammonium hydroxide is added slowly with stirring; a total of 4.8 l. is required. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with water, and air-dried.\nThe product is obtained in the form of bright yellow crystals, m.p. 103\u2013105\u00b0. The yield is 68\u201371 g. (69\u201372% based on p-toluenesulfonylanthranilic acid). This material is dissolved in 1 l. of hot 95% ethanol, treated with 15 g. of Norit, and filtered. The hot solution is diluted with 700 ml. of hot water and cooled. After a second recrystallization, the yield of hexagonal yellow plates is 47 g.; m.p. 105\u2013106\u00b0. Another 6 g. of pure aminoketone can be recovered from the filtrate. The total yield of recrystallized 2-aminobenzophenone is 53 g. (54%) (Note 9)."

To this, in 3- to 4-g. portions, is added with good stirring a total of 127 g. (0.50 mole) of iodine over a period of 30\u201340 minutes. A given portion of iodine is not added until the preceding one has reacted almost completely. Ten minutes after the addition of iodine is completed, 120 ml. of peroxide-free ether is added and the mixture is stirred for a few minutes until the precipitated cyanogen iodide has dissolved in the ethereal layer. The entire contents are then transferred to a previously cooled separatory funnel, and the aqueous layer is separated. This aqueous solution is again extracted successively with 100-ml. and 80-ml. portions of cold, peroxide-free ether. The combined ethereal extracts are poured into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, and the ether is evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature. To the slightly brown crude product, which weighs about 90 g., is added 120 ml. of water. A slightly diminished pressure (\u00bd atm.) is maintained while the contents in the closed flask are heated at 50\u00b0 for 15 minutes with occasional vigorous shaking (Note 1). The mixture is then cooled to 0\u00b0, and the crystalline cyanogen iodide is separated from the light yellow mother liquor by suction on a sintered-glass funnel or filter plate (Note 2). The crude product is washed with six 25-ml. portions of ice water, removed from the sintered-glass funnel, and air-dried (in a good hood) for 1 hour at room temperature. Colorless cyanogen iodide weighing about 59 g. (77%) is obtained; m.p. 141\u2013144\u00b0 (Note 3).\nCyanogen iodide of highest purity may be produced in the following way. The above crude product is dissolved in 150 ml. of boiling chloroform, and the solution is filtered through a plug of glass-wool on a hot-water funnel into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. This solution, after being cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes, is placed in an ice-salt bath and cooled to \u221210\u00b0 (Note 4). By means of suction filtration, the crystalline product is collected on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with three 15-ml. portions of cold chloroform (0\u00b0), and freed from the last traces of solvent by being placed on a watch glass and exposed to the atmosphere (in a good hood) at room temperature for 1 hour. Practically colorless needle-shaped crystals weighing 45 g. (59%) are obtained; m.p. 146\u2013147\u00b0 (Note 3) and (Note 5).\nRemoval of 100 ml. of chloroform from the above filtrate by means of evaporation under reduced pressure at room temperature and subsequent cooling permits isolation of an additional 2 g. of cyanogen iodide; m.p. 146\u2013147\u00b0.

The solution, obtained by decantation from the compact gray selenium, is combined with the above filtrate in a 4-l. distilling flask. Distillation under reduced pressure gives two fractions. The lower-boiling fraction (25\u201360\u00b0/16 mm.) consists mainly of ethanol, water, dioxane, and cyclohexanone; the higher-boiling one (60\u201390\u00b0/16 mm.) contains cyclohexanone and 1,2-cyclohexanedione with traces of water and dioxane. The yield of crude product is approximately 322 g.\nThe higher-boiling fraction is redistilled (Note 5), and again two fractions, boiling at 25\u201375\u00b0/16 mm. and 75\u201379\u00b0/16 mm., are collected. The latter fraction is essentially pure 1,2-cyclohexanedione and crystallizes at 34\u00b0 to ice-like crystals which become light yellow-green when exposed to the air; yield 202.5 g. (60% based on selenous acid). A considerable amount of light-brown, clear, resinous residue remains in the distilling flask.",
            "B. 1,2-Cyclohexanedione dioxime. In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask is placed 200 ml. of water and 100 g. of cracked ice. To this ice-water mixture is added 86.9 g. (1.25 moles) of hydroxylammonium chloride. An ice-cold basic solution is prepared by dissolving 82.4 g. (1.25 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide in 50 ml. of water and then adding 150 g. of cracked ice. The ice-cold potassium hydroxide solution is added to the hydroxylammonium chloride solution, and the mixture is thoroughly shaken. To the mixture is added about 0.5 g. of nioxime (1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime) with stirring (Note 6). The solution turns red owing to the reaction of the nioxime with quantities of iron and other impurities in the reagents. Four grams of Norit is added; the mixture is thoroughly shaken and then filtered with the aid of a 5-in. B\u00fcchner funnel. After this operation the filtrate should be water white.\nThe cold solution is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and is placed in an ice bath. To the stirred solution is added slowly 56 g. (0.5 mole) of melted 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Precipitation of the 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime should take place almost immediately. If not, the solution may be seeded to initiate rapid precipitation. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes after the addition of the 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and the precipitate is then collected on a 5-in. B\u00fcchner funnel. The precipitate is thoroughly washed with water to remove inorganic salts. The 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime is partially dried by suction and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator to give snow-white crystals; yield 52.5 g. (74%); m.p. 185\u2013188\u00b0 (darkening at 170\u00b0) (Note 7). The crude 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime is recrystallized from 550 ml. of water using 2.5 g. of iron-free Norit; yield 39.3 g. (55%); m.p. 186\u2013188\u00b0."

            "A. Cyclopentadiene. Two hundred milliliters (195 g.) of technical dicyclopentadiene (Note 1) is placed in a 500-ml. two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with thermometer and an upright Friedrichs-type condenser (through which water at 50\u00b0 (Note 2) is circulated). The ground-glass (Note 3) outlet of the Friedrichs condenser is connected to the side arm of a simple distilling head fitted with a thermometer and attached to an efficient water-cooled condenser held in a vertical position. At the lower end of this condenser is a receiver which consists of a carefully weighed 500-ml. two-necked round-bottomed flask immersed in a Dry Ice bath (Note 4) and protected from the air by a calcium chloride drying tube.\nThe flask containing dicyclopentadiene is now heated by means of an electric heating mantle or oil bath to approximately 160\u00b0, or until cyclopentadiene distils smoothly at 38\u201346\u00b0 and a little dicyclopentadiene refluxes from the cold-finger (Friedrichs) condenser. After two-thirds of the dicyclopentadiene has been pyrolyzed (during the course of 4\u20135 hours), the residue in the flask may tend to become viscous and a higher temperature for the pyrolysis will be required in order to obtain rapid distillation of cyclopentadiene. In such an event it is desirable to discard the residue while it is still hot and mobile.\nCyclopentadiene dimerizes rapidly at room temperature and should be used immediately (Note 5) or stored at Dry Ice temperatures. As obtained above, the product has a refractive index of about 1.433 at 25\u00b0 and is quite satisfactory as a starting material for the following preparation (Note 6). The yield, which is determined by weighing the receiving flask plus product, depends upon the quality of dicyclopentadiene employed (Note 7).",
            "B. 3-Chlorocyclopentene. The flask containing cyclopentadiene is weighed and the quantity of cyclopentadiene determined (Note 8). A thermometer and gas inlet tube are passed through a two-holed rubber stopper which is fitted to the center neck of the flask; the side neck is fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. While the flask containing cyclopentadiene is being cooled in a Dry Ice bath (Note 9), dry hydrogen chloride (Note 10) is passed in rapidly. During this operation the temperature of the reaction mixture must be kept below 0\u00b0 and the flask swirled to ensure good mixing. From time to time the flask is detached, wiped dry, and weighed quickly in order to determine the amount of hydrogen chloride that has been added. An excess is to be avoided, and it is advisable to stop the addition about 10% short of the theoretical quantity.\nFor many purposes, this crude 3-chlorocyclopentene, either as such or in solution (Note 5), may be used without purification (Note 11) and (Note 12). If a purer product is desired, however, it may be distilled according to the following procedure.\nThe flask containing the crude product is equipped with a capillary tube and distilling head and surrounded by a water bath, which may be heated by a hot plate or steam cone. A water-cooled condenser connects the distilling head with the center neck of a two-necked receiver which is surrounded by a Dry Ice bath. The outer neck of the receiver is fitted with a Dry Ice condenser arranged in such a way that vapors which first escape the receiver are condensed and returned to it. This apparatus is connected through a second Dry Ice trap and soda-lime tower (Note 13) to a vacuum pump. A fore-run is removed at a bath temperature of 20\u00b0 and a pressure of about 15 mm. The receiver is changed, and the product is distilled at 18\u201325\u00b0/5 mm. The temperature of the water bath should not exceed 30\u00b0. 3-Chlorocyclopentene is obtained as a colorless liquid in a yield of 70\u201390% based on cyclopentadiene; n26D 1.4708."

The solution is warmed to 56\u201360\u00b0, and a reaction sets in vigorously with evolution of nitrous oxide. External cooling with water is applied when required; the reaction temperature is maintained below 70\u00b0 during the first 5\u20137 minutes and below 85\u00b0 during the second period of 5\u20137 minutes. After a total of 10\u201315 minutes, the effervescence slackens and the reaction mixture is kept at 90\u2013100\u00b0 until the evolution of gas has completely ceased. This usually requires an additional 15\u201320 minutes.\nThe resulting liquid is heated with about 1 g. of activated carbon and is filtered with suction while hot; the clear, faintly colored filtrate is transferred to an evaporating dish and heated on a steam bath to remove most of the water. The residual, somewhat viscous, liquid (about 120 ml.) is then transferred to a beaker; the evaporating dish is rinsed with 10 ml. of water, and this solution is added to the contents of the beaker. To this is added 95% ethanol (50 ml.), and the mixture is warmed to effect solution. On cooling, large crystals separate which, at 0\u00b0, almost fill the bulk of the solution. The crystalline mass is broken up with a glass rod, collected on a suction filter, and washed quickly, while on the filter, with two successive portions of ice water (Note 2), drained, and air-dried (Note 3). The yield of large, colorless prismatic crystals of asym-dimethylurea is 35\u201340 g.

In a series of preparations, yields can be further increased a few per cent by carrying over mother liquors to subsequent batches."

The cooled mixture is filtered by suction. Crude phenylacetamide remains on the filter and is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water. The crystals are then dried at 50\u201380\u00b0. The yield of crude phenylacetamide is 190\u2013200 g. (82\u201386%). It is sufficiently pure for most purposes although it contains traces of phenylacetic acid. If pure phenylacetamide is desired, the crude, wet solid is stirred for about 30 minutes with 500 ml. of a 10% solution of sodium carbonate, collected on a suction funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and dried. The yield of this product is 180\u2013190 g. (78\u201382%); m.p. 154\u2013155\u00b0 (Note 8) and (Note 9)."

            "A. Reduction and hydrolysis. A solution of 129 g. (0.75 mole) of \u03b2-naphthyl ethyl ether in 1.5 l. of 95% ethanol is prepared in a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a bulb condenser topped by a Friedrichs condenser, and a Y-tube to allow for the introduction of nitrogen and sodium. The apparatus is flushed thoroughly with nitrogen, the nitrogen flow is reduced, and 225 g. (9.8 g. atoms) of sodium is added in small portions (Note 1), with efficient stirring, at a rate sufficient to maintain vigorous boiling. The hydrogen liberated passes through the condensers and a delivery tube into a hood or directly out a window. When approximately two-thirds of the sodium has been introduced, an additional 375 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to reduce the viscosity of the reaction mixture. Approximately 1.5 hours is required for the addition of the sodium. Near the end of this period, the rate of the reaction decreases and heat is supplied by means of an electric heating mantle to maintain the reflux temperature (Note 2).\nAfter all the sodium has dissolved, the hydrogen is thoroughly swept from the system with nitrogen and the heating is discontinued. The Y-tube is replaced by a separatory funnel, and 750 ml. of water is added cautiously (Note 3), with stirring, followed by 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 3). The acidic mixture containing precipitated sodium chloride is heated, with stirring, at the reflux temperature for 30 minutes, and then allowed to cool.\nThe mixture is extracted with ten 175-ml. portions of benzene or 1:1 benzene-ether mixture (Note 4). The combined extract is washed with 75-ml. portions of water until the washings are neutral to litmus. The organic solvent is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The crude oily residue is converted directly (Note 5) to the \u03b2-tetralone bisulfite addition product.",
            "B. Bisulfite addition product of \u03b2-tetralone. To a solution of 325 g. (3.12 moles) of sodium bisulfite (commercial purified grade) in 565 ml. of water is added 175 ml. of 95% ethanol. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight, and the precipitated sodium bisulfite is removed by filtration. The filtrate is added to the crude \u03b2-tetralone, and the mixture is shaken vigorously. Within a few minutes the addition product separates as a voluminous precipitate. The mixture is kept cold for several hours, shaken periodically, and then filtered with the aid of suction. The precipitate is washed well, first with 125 ml. of 95% ethanol, then four times with 125-ml. portions of ether (Note 6). The colorless addition product is air-dried (Note 5) and is stored in air-tight containers. The yield is 113\u2013131 g. (60\u201370% based on \u03b2-naphthyl ethyl ether) (Note 7).",

(0.6 mole) of sodium carbonate monohydrate is added. At this point the pH of the solution is approximately 10. The mixture is extracted with five 100-ml. portions of ether (Note 8). The combined extract is washed with 100 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, then with 100-ml. portions of water until the washings are neutral to litmus, and is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure, preferably in a nitrogen atmosphere.

The flask is fitted with a 500-ml. dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask, and hydrogen sulfide is passed in through the inlet tube with stirring and cooling until the solution is saturated and does not give an alkaline reaction with phenolphthalein (Note 2) and (Note 3). The mixture is further cooled to 10\u201315\u00b0 by means of an ice bath, and 200 g.

            "Caution! All reactions involving liquid ammonia must be carried out in an effective hood.\nBromine (approximately 15 ml.) is added dropwise to 50 g. (0.271 mole) of 10-undecenoic acid (Note 1) dissolved in 210 ml. of dry ether with constant stirring while the temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0 until the color of bromine persists. The excess bromine is then removed by the addition of a few drops of 10-undecenoic acid.\nThe sodamide for dehydrobromination of dibromohendecanoic acid is prepared according to the method of Khan et al.,2 with some modifications (Note 2). A 3-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a stirrer and a Dry Ice-acetone cold finger reflux condenser attached through a drying tube to a trap and a bubbler filled with a saturated ammonia solution. After the condenser has been cooled with a mixture of Dry Ice and acetone, 1.5 l. of liquid ammonia is introduced into the flask through an inlet tube. Stirring is started, and 1.2\u20131.5 g. of ferric chloride (C.P., anhydrous, black) is added to the liquid ammonia in one portion as quickly as possible. Within 20 seconds after this addition, 6 g. of metallic sodium is dropped into the brown solution in two portions in order to convert the iron salt into catalytic iron. When the evolution of hydrogen gas ceases, the remainder of the sodium (total amount, 27.7 g., 1.2 g. atoms) is added in pieces and the solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes (Note 3).\nFinally, the solution of 10,11-dibromohendecanoic acid in absolute ether is added slowly from a separatory funnel to the reaction flask. The reaction mixture is then stirred for 6 hours. After an additional hour (Note 4) of stirring, during which time the cold-finger condenser is removed from the system, an excess of solid ammonium chloride (40 g., 0.74 mole) is introduced slowly into the reaction mixture to destroy excess sodamide. The ammonia is allowed to evaporate, 400\u2013500 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred until all the solid is broken up and dissolved (Note 5).\nThe water solution containing the sodium salt of the product is acidified with 6N hydrochloric acid and then extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are combined, washed with water (until the aqueous phase shows a pH in the range 5\u20136), and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of the solvent, the red-colored residual oil is fractionally distilled through a packed column (Note 6). The middle portion (26\u201328 g.) distilling at 124\u2013130\u00b0/3 mm. is crystallized twice from petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) to obtain white crystals of 10-undecynoic acid. The end fractions also yield some white product after 4\u20135 crystallizations. A total yield of 19\u201324 g. (38\u201349%) is obtained; m.p. 42.5\u201343\u00b0."

Three-holed rubber stopper G (bearing the stem of a 125-ml. separatory funnel C with stopcock D closed, a long inlet tube E, and a short outlet tube F) is inserted in the neck of H. In the neck of C, a rubber stopper B, provided with an inlet tube A, is inserted. H is flushed with nitrogen (Note 2) admitted at E. To the water is added 16.0 g. (0.1 mole) of alloxan monohydrate (Note 3), and the mixture is stirred by the flow of nitrogen through E until the alloxan monohydrate has dissolved. The nitrogen flow is discontinued, and hydrogen sulfide (Note 4) is passed in at E until the mixture is saturated with this gas and the aqueous solution is free from opalescence (about 2 hours). Carbon disulfide (100 ml.) is now added, and the mixture is agitated for 5 minutes by means of the hydrogen sulfide gas stream. The carbon disulfide layer is then cautiously withdrawn through J and discarded, and the aqueous solution is washed once more with 100 ml. of carbon disulfide which is separated and discarded. The hydrogen sulfide flow is discontinued, and nitrogen is passed in at E for about 2 hours or until the gas emerging at F gives no more than a faint test for hydrogen sulfide with lead acetate paper.\nFig. 1. Apparatus for preparation of alloxantin dihydrate.\nTubes E and F are now closed, stopper B is loosened, and C is flushed out with nitrogen admitted through tube A. Deaerated water (100 ml.) is placed in C, which is then flushed with nitrogen. To this water is added alloxan monohydrate (16.0 g.; 0.1 mole), and the mixture is stirred with A, while the nitrogen stream is continued, until the solid has dissolved. B is now pushed down to give a tight fit, a slight pressure of nitrogen is applied (at A), F and D are opened, and the solution is allowed to pass from C into H. To wash out traces of alloxan, a further 10 ml. of water is placed in C and run into H. D is closed, and nitrogen is passed in at E and out of F until the solutions are thoroughly mixed. E and F are now closed, and the mixture in H is allowed to stand until crystallization is complete (overnight). In the meantime, the stem of funnel H is inserted in one hole of the two-holed rubber stopper L (also bearing inlet tube K); L is inserted in the mouth of M (a 150-ml., Pyrex B\u00fcchner funnel with coarse, fritted-glass septum); and the stem of M is inserted in the rubber stopper N placed in the neck of a 2-liter B\u00fcchner flask P (side arm, Q). To flush out M and P, nitrogen is passed in at K and out of Q. K and Q are now closed, F is opened, and a slight pressure of nitrogen is applied at F. Q and J are opened, and, if necessary, slight suction is applied at Q. When all the suspension has passed out of H, the nitrogen stream is continued for a few minutes, to remove as much as possible of the liquid clinging to the precipitate in M.

(0.67 mole) of acetophenone, 60 ml. of ether, and 100 ml. of water. The apparatus is assembled in a well-ventilated hood, the flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and 82 g. (1.67 moles) of granulated sodium cyanide is added all at once with vigorous stirring. When most of the sodium cyanide has dissolved and the temperature of the mixture has fallen to 5\u00b0, 140 ml. (1.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains between 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0. The addition requires about 1.7 hours. After all the acid has been added, the cooling bath is removed and vigorous stirring is continued for 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to settle, and the liquid portion is decanted into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The water layer is returned to the reaction flask, and 100 ml. of water is added to dissolve the salts. The aqueous solution is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of ether, and the original ether layer and extracts are combined in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. The ether is distilled at 20\u201330 mm. pressure (water aspirator) (Note 1), and the residual oil is poured slowly with stirring into 160 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture then is saturated with hydrogen chloride gas in the hood (Note 2) and (Note 3) and allowed to stand overnight.\nPart of the excess hydrogen chloride is removed by blowing (or drawing) air through the solution for 1 hour. The solution then is made alkaline by the slow addition of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide. (Note 4) with mechanical stirring and cooling in an ice bath. Solid sodium hydroxide (24 g.) is added, and the mixture is steam-distilled until no more ammonia and acetophenone pass into the distillate (Note 5). About 3\u20134 l. of distillate is collected (Note 6).\nWater is added to the residue if necessary to make the volume 700 ml., and the solution is treated with 2 g. of Norit and filtered with suction (Note 7). The filtrate is extracted with 100 ml. of ether (which is discarded), and acidified by the addition of 80 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After thorough chilling, preferably overnight in a refrigerator, the precipitated atrolactic acid is collected on a suction filter (Note 8) and air-dried at a temperature not exceeding 65\u00b0.\nThe crude product weighs somewhat more than 70 g. and contains water and sodium chloride. It is dissolved in 500 ml. of boiling benzene, the solution is filtered by gravity, and the solid in the flask and funnel is rinsed with 50 ml. of boiling benzene. The filtrate is concentrated by distillation until no more water collects in the distillate, and the residual solution (300\u2013400 ml.) is cooled. The atrolactic acid which crystallizes is collected on a suction filter and washed with 25 ml. of cold benzene and 25 ml. of commercial pentane (b.p. 30\u201340\u00b0). After air-drying, the cream-colored product amounts to 42.9\u201343.5 g., m.p. 88\u201390\u00b0 with shrinking at 82\u00b0 (Note 9) and (Note 10). It is pure enough for most purposes but is intermediate in composition between the anhydrous acid and hemihydrate and contains about 3% sodium chloride. This product is dissolved in 200 ml. of boiling water and treated with 10 g. of Norit. The solution is filtered and cooled overnight at 0\u20135\u00b0. The pure, colorless crystals of atrolactic acid hemihydrate that separate are collected on a suction filter and air-dried. The yield is 33.5\u201334.7 g. (29\u201330%), m.p. 88\u201390\u00b0 with softening beginning at 75\u00b0. The anhydrous acid can be obtained by drying the hemihydrate at 55\u00b0/1\u20132 mm.; m.p. 94.5\u201395\u00b0."

            "A 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser topped with a tube containing soda lime and calcium chloride. In this flask are placed 38 g. (1 mole) of pulverized lithium aluminum hydride (Note 1) and 400 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 15 minutes or until most of the lithium aluminum hydride has dissolved. A solution of 90.5 g. (0.8 mole) of 5,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone (p.357) in 200 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2) is added slowly at such a rate that the solvent refluxes gently without external heating. When the addition is complete and the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is stirred and heated at gentle reflux for 8 hours.\nThe condenser is then set for downward distillation, and, while the mixture is stirred, about 450 ml. of solvent is distilled (Note 3) and (Note 4). The condenser is reset in the reflux position, and 300 ml. of ether (commercial anhydrous) is added slowly from the dropping funnel with vigorous stirring. This is followed by 50 ml. of ethyl acetate added very slowly with vigorous stirring and finally by 500 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid added in the same manner.\nThe condenser is again set downward, and the dropping funnel is replaced by a tube reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask. Steam is passed in, and the distillation is continued for several minutes after the boiling point reaches 100\u00b0 (Note 5). The distillate is discarded. The mixture in the flask is cooled, and to it is added carefully 350 ml. of 12N sodium hydroxide with stirring (Note 6). The alkaline mixture is then steam-distilled until the distillate is no longer basic (Note 7).\nThe 2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine may be recovered from the aqueous distillate in two ways: (a) the distillate can be extracted continuously with ether;2 or (b) the distillate can be acidified with hydrochloric acid and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give crude 2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine hydrochloride. The base is then liberated by adding an excess of saturated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The oily layer is separated. The aqueous layer and salt are extracted several times with ether, which is combined with the amine. In either case the ether solution is dried thoroughly over anhydrous potassium carbonate (Note 8).\nThe drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is stripped through a short helices-packed column. The residue is fractionally distilled at 103\u2013105\u00b0/745 mm.;nD20 1.4330;nD251.4304; d4250.8211. The yield is 53\u201362 g. (67\u201379%)."

To the stirred mixture is added, in one portion, 80 g. (0.6 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The stirred mixture is heated until refluxing begins and is maintained at this temperature for 3 hours. During this period much hydrogen chloride is evolved, and the initially yellow solution soon becomes deep red. The solution is cooled and decomposed by the cautious addition of small pieces of ice, and then 400 ml. of water is added cautiously, followed by 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene is removed by steam distillation, and the product is separated by filtration from the hot mixture. The lumps of product are crushed and extracted with 400 ml. of boiling 10% sodium carbonate solution. The mixture is filtered, and the extraction is repeated on the undissolved residue with an additional 200 ml. of hot 10% sodium carbonate solution. The basic filtrates are combined, 3\u20134 g. of Norit is added, and the mixture is heated to boiling. The Norit is separated by filtration, and the cooled solution is strongly acidified with cold concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 2).

Claisen flask, equipped with a dropping funnel, is heated on a steam bath, and the filtered chloroform extract is added dropwise. Heating is continued until all the solvent has been removed. The residue is then distilled at 3\u20135 mm. pressure. Following a small fore-run of less than 1 g. (Note 5), the m-nitrostyrene distils as a yellow liquid. The yield is 13\u201314 g. (56\u201360%), b.p. 90\u201396\u00b0/3.5 mm., nD20 1.5836, nD27 1.5800\u20131.5802 (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A wide-mouth 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask is supported inside a water bath of at least 2-l. capacity so that the bottom of the flask is not in contact with the bottom of the bath. The bath is filled with water at about 15\u00b0 to cover at least half the height of the flask. The flask is fitted with a moderate-speed stainless-steel propeller-type stirrer, and 350 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) at 20\u00b0 is poured into it. Veratraldehyde,2 70 g. (0.42 mole) (Note 2), is crushed at least as fine as rice grains and is slowly added in small portions to the acid. The rate of addition should be such that it requires about 1 hour to add all the aldehyde. It is helpful, although not usually necessary, to add two or three ice cubes to the bath at the start of the nitration. The internal temperature is checked from time to time and should be held between 18\u00b0 and 22\u00b0. The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes after the addition of the last of the aldehyde.\nThe mixture is then poured into 4 l. of vigorously agitated cold water (Note 3) in a suitable opaque container. From this point onward the protection of the product from light is extremely important. The stirring is continued for a few minutes; then the batch is filtered through a 24-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The container and funnel are kept covered with an opaque sheet of some kind except while the transfer is being made. The cake is sucked down well and then returned to the crock and reslurried a few minutes with 2 l. of cold water. It is then refiltered, pressed out well with a spatula, and drained as well as possible.\nThe filter cake at this point is 60% to 80% water, and the material is sensitive to heat and to light. The drying, therefore, is difficult and slow, and the exact procedure will depend upon the equipment available. One satisfactory method is to set the B\u00fcchner funnel containing the wet material in a large forced-draft oven for 8 hours at 50\u00b0. The material, still very wet, is then easily spread on a tray and is placed in a dark but ventilated storeroom, where it is allowed to air-dry for 48 hours or until the weight of the product is less than about 90 g. The product now contains from 10% to 20% of water and is best recrystallized without more thorough drying.\nThe material is dissolved in 2 l. of boiling 95% ethanol. It is not necessary to filter this solution for the first crystallization. Upon standing overnight, the solution is solid with precipitate. This structure is easily broken up and is filtered on a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The mother liquor is concentrated to about 700 ml. and allowed to cool. The second crop of solid is added to the first and dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0 overnight. The dry material weighs 65\u201370 g., corresponding to a yield of 73\u201379%, and melts at 129\u2013131\u00b0. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes. One additional crystallization from 1 l. of 95% ethanol gives 55\u201360 g. of pure material, melting at 132\u2013133\u00b0."

Anhydrous liquid ammonia (1 l.) is introduced from a commercial cylinder through the inlet tube, and 1 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate is added, followed by 80.5 g. (3.5 g. atoms) of clean, freshly cut sodium (Note 1) and (Note 2).

            "A 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask in an electric heating mantle is fitted with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser topped with a tube containing soda lime and calcium chloride. In this flask are placed 21.3 g. (0.56 mole) of pulverized lithium aluminum hydride (Note 1) and 300 ml. of dry ether. The mixture is heated under reflux until most of the hydride has dissolved. A solution of 157.3 g. (0.92 mole) of ethyl \u03b1-(1-pyrrolidyl)propionate (p.466) in 200 ml. of dry ether is then added slowly with vigorous stirring at such a rate that the solvent refluxes gently. When the addition is complete and the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is stirred at the reflux temperature an additional 30 minutes. The excess lithium aluminum hydride is decomposed by adding 50 ml. of ethyl acetate slowly with stirring. This is followed by 600 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, added slowly with vigorous stirring.\nThe mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The water layer is separated, washed once with ether, and made strongly alkaline by the addition of 1 l. of 6N sodium hydroxide (Note 2). The mixture is returned to the original 2-l. three-necked flask. An attachment for continuous ether extraction is placed in one of the side necks,2 and 6-in. extension columns are placed in the other two necks. The stirrer is fitted through the center column and neck. Ether is added through the column attached to the side neck until the proper ether level is attained. A stopper is then placed on this column. The stirrer is run at such a rate that gentle swirling is accomplished without hindering the separation of the ether layer, and the continuous extraction with ether is continued until test with pH paper indicates that the ether coming over contains no more basic material. The ether solution of the product is thoroughly dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate (Note 3). The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent by distillation at atmospheric pressure and finally at water-pump pressure. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure through a short fractionating column; b.p. 95\u201396\u00b0/20 mm. (109\u2013110\u00b0/40 mm., 80\u00b0/11 mm.); nD20 1.4780; nD25 1.4758; d425 0.9733.

(0.5 mole) of magnesium oxide (Note 3). The flask is immersed in a Wood's metal bath heated at 335\u2013340\u00b0 (Note 4). After the reaction has proceeded for 1 hour, 10-g. portions of melted stearic are added down the condenser at 15-minute intervals until an additional 240 g. (284 g., 1 mole total) has been added (Note 5). The heating is continued until the total reaction time is 10 hours.\nThe reaction flask is removed from the metal bath and allowed to cool to about 100\u00b0, and the liquid contents are poured with stirring into 1 l. of 4N sulfuric acid in a 3-l. beaker. This mixture is boiled with vigorous mechanical stirring until the frothing ceases (Note 6) and the upper layer is clear (about 2 hours). The lower aqueous layer is then siphoned off, and the upper layer is boiled for 1 hour with 1 l. of water. The water layer is separated, and the upper layer is boiled with 1 l. of a 5% sodium hydroxide solution for 1 hour with vigorous stirring. The ketone layer is then separated and boiled for 1 hour each with three successive 1 l. portions of hot water (Note 7) with good stirring.\nThe crude stearone is allowed to solidify and is then broken up and dried by pressing between filter paper. The crude yield is 230\u2013240 g. (91\u201395%). The product melts at 84\u201386\u00b0 and has an acid value of zero. It is purified by dissolving in 1.2 l. of a 2:1 mixture of benzene and absolute ethanol, filtering hot, and allowing to crystallize (Note 8). After a second crystallization from the same mixed solvents, the stearone is obtained as glistening white flakes, melting clear at 89\u201389.5\u00b0 (shrinks at 87\u201388\u00b0).

(0.2 mole) of p-aminoacetophenone (Note 1), 100 g. of chopped ice, and 53 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). To the stirred mixture is added, over a period of 5 minutes, a solution of 13.8 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 75 ml. of water. The stirring is continued for 15 minutes, during which all the insoluble amine hydrochloride reacts to form the soluble diazonium compound (Note 2).\nIn a 4-l. beaker, equipped with a high-speed stirrer (Note 3), are placed 20 g. (0.185 mole) of quinone (Note 4), 34 g. (0.4 mole) of sodium bicarbonate, 50 g. of chopped ice, and 500 ml. of water. About 10 ml. of the above diazonium salt solution is added (Note 5). After the frothing has subsided (Note 6), the diazonium salt solution is added in 10- to 20-ml. portions over a period of about an hour (Note 7). The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 15\u00b0 during this period by the addition of ice. After the diazonium salt solution has been added, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, and the stirring is continued for an additional hour. The precipitate of 2-p-acetylphenylquinone is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed thoroughly with approximately 1 l. of water. The yield of crude yellow-brown solid is 40\u201341 g. (96\u201398%). The melting point ranges from 125\u2013135\u00b0 to 134\u2013136\u00b0 (Note 8).\nThe crude quinone is dissolved in 250 ml. of chloroform (Note 9) and added to a solution of 40 g. of sodium hydrosulfite in 300 ml. of water. The mixture is shaken for 10 minutes, and the light-tan 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone which precipitates from solution is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried. The yield of crude hydroquinone is 32\u201337 g. (78\u201392%). The melting point ranges from 175\u2013180\u00b0 to 184\u2013194\u00b0 (Note 10).\nA suspension of 35 g. (0.153 mole) of 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone in 77 ml. of acetic anhydride is treated with 0.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The hydroquinone goes into solution immediately with the evolution of much heat. The dark-colored solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight; then it is poured into 400 ml. of water. The acetylated material is collected by suction filtration and dried. The crude 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone diacetate is distilled at reduced pressure (b.p. 236\u2013241\u00b0/1 mm. or 182\u2013190\u00b0/0.1 mm.), and the hot distillate is poured into 20 ml. of n-butyl alcohol (Note 11). The product immediately separates as a colorless, crystalline mass, which is collected by suction filtration and dried. The yield is 32\u201335 g.

(0.11 mole) of 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone diacetate in 140 ml. of hot methanol. The solution is cooled to room temperature, causing some of the hydroquinone diacetate to crystallize. A slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the suspension, and 70 ml. of methanol containing 6.1 g. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours under nitrogen, during which period the hydroquinone diacetate gradually dissolves. The pale yellow solution is poured onto 500 g. of chopped ice, and the colorless or faintly yellowish solid is collected by suction filtration and dried. The yield of p-acetylphenylhydroquinone melting at 193\u2013194\u00b0 is 24.8 g. (quantitative). The over-all yield of product based on quinone is 50\u201366%."

A is a Pyrex combustion tube, 54 cm. long and 3.5 cm. in diameter, having a glass star seal or indentations 14 cm. from the lower end to support the catalyst, and fitted with ground-glass joints. B is a Pyrex tube, 21 cm. long and 3.5 cm. in diameter, which has a 6-cm. length of 6-mm. capillary tubing attached at the lower end. The capillary tube is attached to a ground-glass joint and an inlet tube, C, is inserted above the end of the capillary tube. The top section of the apparatus (above the first ground-glass joint) is covered with asbestos and wound with 14 ft. of No. 22 Chromel A resistance wire. D is a 500-ml. round-bottomed two-necked flask with ground-glass joints and a 4-mm. stopcock sealed to the bottom. An efficient condenser is attached to the flask and connected to a gas absorption trap.2 The hot junction of a pyrometer is placed in contact with the glass combustion tube A at its center, and the tube is wrapped with a thin layer of asbestos paper. An electric furnace with a 33-cm. heated section which is rated at 6.8 amp. (110 v.) is used to heat the combustion tube.\nFig. 3.\nA piece of glass wool is placed on the star seal, and the combustion tube is filled with 74 g. (110 ml.) of 14- to 20-mesh silica gel (Note 1). The tube is heated to 500\u00b0, and nitrogen is passed through the column for 30 minutes to activate the catalyst. Anhydrous ammonia is then passed through the column at a rate of 3.9 moles per hour (Note 2). Molten azelaic acid, 100 g. (0.53 mole) (Note 3), is poured into the reservoir B, which is maintained at 108\u2013112\u00b0 by means of the electrically heated jacket, and allowed to drop onto the hot silica gel over a 4-hour period (Note 4). After the azelaic acid has been added, ammonia is passed through the tube for an additional period of 30 minutes, with the temperature maintained at 500\u00b0, to complete the removal of product from the combustion tube.\nWater (100 ml.) and ether (350 ml.) are added to the condensate in the receiver D, and the mixture is shaken. The aqueous layer is removed, and the ethereal solution is washed with 75 ml. of 6N sodium hydroxide solution. The ethereal solution is washed with water until the washings are neutral and is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed under reduced pressure by warming with a water bath, and the residue is distilled through a Vigreux or packed column.

            "A. o-Carboxycinnamic acid. Eighty-eight grams (78 ml., 0.46 mole of peracid) of 40% peracetic acid (Note 1) is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask which is immersed in a water bath maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0. A 150-ml. dropping funnel is mounted so that the stem enters the flask to within about 4 cm. of the liquid surface. With mechanical stirring (Note 2), a cold solution of 20 g. (0.14 mole) of \u03b2-naphthol (Note 3) in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise over a period of 4 hours to the peracid. With the appropriate rate of addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture slowly rises to 30\u201335\u00b0 and should not exceed 40\u00b0. Solid material begins to separate from the orange solution when one-third or more of the naphthol solution is introduced. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour and the flask is allowed to stand in the water bath until the exothermic reaction ceases (usually 6\u20138 hours), then at room temperature for 4 days (Note 4). The solid material is collected by suction filtration and washed on the filter with sufficient (10\u201320 ml.) acetic acid to remove colored impurities. Drying in the air gives 19.6\u201320.1 g. of crude o-carboxycinnamic acid as a pale yellow crystalline solid (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nThe crude acid is purified by dissolving in 360\u2013400 ml. of cold 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, filtering, and acidifying the filtrate with sufficient excess of mineral acid to turn Congo red paper blue. The product is separated by suction filtration, washed with water to remove mineral acid, and air-dried. Material thus obtained weighs 17.9\u201318.7 g. (67\u201370% yield). It melts generally (Note 6) between 202\u00b0 and 205\u00b0, and is sufficiently pure (Note 7) for most practical purposes.",

The steam bath is then removed while 54 g. (Note 9) of nickel-aluminum alloy (Raney catalyst) powder is added through the open neck of the flask in small portions (from the end of a spatula) at frequent intervals (Note 10). When addition of the alloy is complete (about 50 minutes), the mixture is stirred and maintained at 90\u201395\u00b0 for 1 hour by warming on a steam bath. Distilled water is added as needed to maintain the total volume at approximately 550 ml. The hot mixture is filtered with suction, and the metallic residue is washed with 50 ml. of hot 10% sodium hydroxide solution and two 50-ml. portions of hot water in such a manner that the solid is always covered with liquid (Note 11). The cooled filtrate and washings are added dropwise with mechanical stirring to 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in an open 2-l. beaker at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 80\u201385\u00b0 (Note 12).

(4 moles) of diethyl oxalate (Note 2) and 312 g. (1 mole) of ethyl stearate (Note 3) are quickly added. The condenser is replaced by a still head connected to a condenser and receiver arranged for distillation at reduced pressure. If a water aspirator is used, a drying tube filled with Drierite should be inserted in the line between the receiver and aspirator. The receiver is cooled in a bath of ice water. The reaction mixture is heated at 50\u00b0, and the pressure in the system is reduced to about 100 mm. The temperature is gradually raised to 60\u00b0, with the system at a pressure of 100 \u00b1 10 mm., to remove the ethanol used as solvent and formed as by-product. This distillation requires 2\u20133 hours (Note 4).\nThe receiver is changed and the excess diethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure in the range of 76\u201382\u00b0/15 mm. (Note 5).

The organic (upper) layer is taken up in 300 ml. of ether and washed well with sodium bicarbonate solution and with water; then the ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath.\nThe residual \u03b1-ethoxalyl ester is decarbonylated to cetylmalonic ester by heating at 160\u2013170\u00b0 under reduced pressure. A water aspirator is sufficient to facilitate removal of the carbon monoxide formed during the heating. The decarbonylation requires about 1\u20131.5 hours (Note 7).

After addition is complete, the white, pasty mass is stirred for an additional 3 hours without cooling or heating and then is allowed to stand overnight. The resulting suspension is cooled with an ice bath, and the white sodium salt of 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is collected on a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and dried by suction for about 1 hour (Note 1). The sodium salt cake is broken up and transferred to a 4-l. beaker equipped with a Hershberg stirrer and immersed in an ice bath. A cold solution of 184 g. (175 ml., 3 moles) of glacial acetic acid in 1250 ml. of water is added in a single portion, and the mixture is stirred for 10\u201330 minutes to complete dissolution. The oily layer of 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts and the 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol are combined, dried briefly over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation from a steam bath with a water aspirator at 20\u201335 mm. to remove ether and excess nitromethane. The crude, undistilled 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol (Note 5) is dissolved in 450 ml. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. externally cooled stainless-steel hydrogenation bottle (Note 6). Three heaping teaspoonfuls of W-4 Raney nickel catalyst2 are added, and the mixture is shaken with hydrogen at 40\u201345 p.s.i., with cooling to maintain the temperature below 35\u00b0, until about 90% of the theoretical amount (7.5 moles) is taken up and absorption ceases (Note 7). The catalyst is separated by filtration with suction through Filter-Cel, and the filtrate (sometimes green or tan) containing the 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanol is used directly in the next step (Note 8).\nThe filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, immersed in an ice-salt mixture and equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The solution is diluted with 2.3 l. of ice water; then an ice-cold solution of 290 g. (4.2 moles) of sodium nitrite in 750 ml. of water is added dropwise during a period of about 1 hour with stirring and cooling (ice-salt bath) to maintain the temperature at \u22125\u00b0. The mixture is stirred for an additional period of 1 hour and then allowed to come to room temperature overnight as the ice in the cooling bath melts. The acetic acid in the reaction mixture is neutralized by the addition of small portions of solid sodium bicarbonate, and the neutral (to litmus paper) solution is then steam-distilled until about 2 l. of distillate is collected. The oily cycloheptanone layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried briefly over magnesium sulfate. Most of the ether is removed by distillation through a 17 by 2.5 cm. glass helix-packed column at atmospheric pressure (Note 9). The residue is then distilled through the same column, and the fraction boiling at 80\u201385\u00b0/30 mm. is collected. The yield of cycloheptanone is 112\u2013118 g. (40\u201342%), n25D 1.4600 (Note 10) and (Note 11).",
            "In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1), a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, are placed 49 g. (0.5 mole) of cyclohexanone (Note 2), 125 g. (0.58 mole) of p-tolylsulfonylmethylnitrosamide (p. 943), 150 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 10 ml. of water (Note 3). The nitroso compound is largely undissolved. The stirrer is adjusted so that only the upper portion of solution is stirred and the precipitate moves slightly. The thermometer bulb is placed in the liquid.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to about 0\u00b0 with an ice-salt bath; then with gentle stirring a solution of 15 g. of potassium hydroxide in 50 ml. of 50% aqueous ethanol is added dropwise very slowly from the dropping funnel. After the addition of 0.5\u20131 ml. of the alkaline solution a brisk evolution of nitrogen commences and the temperature rises. The rate of addition is adjusted so that the temperature is maintained at 10\u201320\u00b0 (Note 4). The addition of the alkali requires about 2 hours, during which the nitroso compound gradually disappears. The orange-yellow solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, then 2N hydrochloric acid (about 50 ml.) is added until the solution is acidic to litmus paper.\nA solution of 100 g. of sodium bisulfite (Note 5) in 200 ml. of water is added as stirring is continued. After a few minutes a thick precipitate separates. The mixture is stirred or preferably shaken mechanically at room temperature with exclusion of air for 10 hours. The bisulfite addition product is separated by suction filtration, washed with ether until colorless, and decomposed in a flask with a lukewarm solution of 125 g. of sodium carbonate in 150 ml. of water. The ketone layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with four 25-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Most of the ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residual oil is distilled at reduced pressure (Note 6).\nAfter a few drops of fore-run, practically all the liquid distils at 64\u201365\u00b0/12 mm. The yield of cycloheptanone is 18.5\u201320.2 g. (33\u201336%) (Note 6)."

During this period the mixture, which is agitated occasionally by gentle swirling, gradually darkens to a deep brownish red or sometimes a blue color. Finally the mixture is heated at 60\u00b0 for 5\u20136 hours. After cooling, it is transferred to a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask and distilled at reduced pressure (water aspirator). A calcium chloride guard tube is inserted between the vacuum line and the apparatus, and the flask is heated with a bath rather than a free flame. After a small fore-run of thionyl chloride, the malonyl chloride distils at 58\u201360\u00b0/28 mm. The pale yellow product amounts to 50.5\u201360 g. (72\u201385% yield), nD29 1.4572.\nB.

A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer, a mercury- or rubber sleeve-sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard tube, and a dropping funnel (either pressure-equalized or protected by a calcium chloride guard tube).

(0.2 mole) of malonyl dichloride in about 60 ml. of dry, alcohol-free chloroform (Note 6) is added slowly from the dropping funnel while the reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath. The reaction is strongly exothermic, and the rate of dropping is regulated so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 30\u00b0. After the addition is complete (about 30 minutes) the light-greenish mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours. The mixture is then cooled, 150 ml. of ice-cold 6N sulfuric acid is added with stirring, and the product is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether (Note 7). The combined ether extracts are washed once with 6N sulfuric acid, twice with water, twice with 10% potassium carbonate, and once with saturated sodium chloride, and are finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to which a small amount of potassium carbonate is added.

            "A. Purification of phenanthrene. 1. By azeotropic distillation.2 A mixture of 300 g. of commercial phenanthrene (Note 1), 90 g. of maleic anhydride, and 600 ml. of xylene, contained in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, is heated under reflux for 20 hours (Note 2). The initially yellow solution rapidly turns to a dark brown on heating. This solution is cooled to room temperature and filtered by suction to remove any insoluble adduct. The filtrate is then extracted with two 100-ml. portions of dilute sodium hydroxide, and the basic extracts are discarded. The organic phase is next washed with water and saturated sodium chloride solution, and finally is filtered through a layer of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The excess xylene is removed by distillation, first at atmospheric pressure; then the final portions are removed at reduced pressure. The residue, while still hot, is poured into a large mortar and, after solidification, is powdered to a convenient size. The yield of crude phenanthrene is 230\u2013240 g.\nA solution of 52 g. of the crude phenanthrene in 400 ml. of diethylene glycol (Note 3) is azeotropically distilled through a small column (Note 4). A fore-run of approximately 50 g. is collected at 155\u2013165\u00b0/100 mm., followed by the main fraction of 390\u2013400 g., b.p. 140\u2013141\u00b0/21 mm. (Note 5). The fore-run contains considerable fluorene and should be discarded. The main fraction is added to five times its volume of water, and the precipitated hydrocarbon is collected by suction filtration and washed well with water to remove the last traces of diethylene glycol. The colorless product (41\u201343 g.) is heated under reflux for 3 hours with about 450 ml. of 95% ethanol containing approximately 9 g. of Raney nickel catalyst. The hot solution is filtered with slight suction through a sintered-glass funnel. On being concentrated to about 250 ml. and cooled, the filtrate deposits 33\u201335 g. (63\u201367%) of colorless phenanthrene, m.p. 97.5\u201398\u00b0.\n2. By sodium treatment.3 Commercial phenanthrene (Note 1) is treated with maleic anhydride as described above (part 1), and 170 g. of the residue is added to a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a Hershberg mercury-sealed Nichrome stirrer,4 an air condenser, and a thermometer. Ten grams of sodium is added, and the mixture is vigorously stirred at 190\u2013200\u00b0 for 6 hours. The dark residue is cooled to about 80\u00b0, and 300 ml. of benzene is added. The mixture is brought to reflux with stirring and, while still hot, is cautiously filtered through a coarse sintered-glass funnel with gentle suction (Note 6). The benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residual phenanthrene is distilled through a small column (Note 4) adapted to the distillation of solids to give 125\u2013130 g. (74\u201376%) of colorless phenanthrene, b.p. 183\u2013183.5\u00b0/15 mm. This product is heated under reflux for 3 hours with about 1.2 l. of 95% ethanol containing approximately 9 g. of Raney nickel catalyst, and the hot solution is filtered as described under paragraph 1. The filtrate on cooling deposits 115\u2013120 g. (68\u201371%) of colorless phenanthrene, m.p. 97\u201398\u00b0.",
            "B. Catalytic reduction. A hydrogenation bomb of approximately 300 ml. total capacity is charged with 29.5 g. (0.17 mole) of purified phenanthrene (Note 7); then 70 ml. of cyclohexane (Note 8) and 1.5 g. of copper chromium oxide catalyst (Note 9) are added. The bomb is filled with hydrogen to an initial pressure of 2000 p.s.i. at 20\u00b0 and heated with shaking to 150\u00b0 (maximum pressure about 2900 p.s.i.). The hydrogenation proceeds rapidly under these conditions, and about 85% of the theoretical uptake is complete within 1.75\u20132 hours. The reaction is interrupted at this point (Note 10), and the catalyst is removed by centrifugation or filtration. The cyclohexane is evaporated, and the residue is distilled through a small column (Note 4). After a small fore-run (0.2\u20130.3 g.) distilling below 182\u00b0, there is collected 21\u201323 g.(70\u201377% yield) of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, b.p. 183\u2013184\u00b0/25 mm., nD25 1.6401\u20131.6416. The residue consists of 4.5\u20135.0 g. (15\u201317%) of phenanthrene, m.p. 96.5\u201398\u00b0, which may be recycled."

Heat is then applied again, and distillation of the product begins at a flask temperature of 160\u00b0 and continues until the temperature reaches 200\u00b0. The stirrer is stopped, the receiver is changed, and, after the flask and contents have cooled to about 120\u00b0, 50 ml. of water is added. The thermometer is replaced by an inlet tube, and steam is passed in until no more insoluble material passes over. Usually collection of about 200\u2013300 ml. of distillate is sufficient. The distillate is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the extracts are combined with the dimethylfurazan obtained by direct distillation (Note 4). The ether solution is dried for a short time over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is evaporated on a steam bath. The residue is distilled at atmospheric pressure through a short column, and after a fore-run, consisting chiefly of biacetyl, the dimethylfurazan distils at 154\u2013159\u00b0 as a colorless liquid, nD25 1.4234\u20131.4243, m.p. \u22127.2 to \u22126.6\u00b0. The yield is 59\u201363 g. (60\u201364%)."

            "A. o-Methylbenzyl acetate. A solution of 29.8 g. (0.20 mole) of 2-methylbenzyldimethylamine (p.585) and 32.7 g. (0.30 mole) of ethyl bromide in 40 ml. of absolute ethanol is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser capped with a calcium chloride drying tube. The solution is heated under reflux on the steam bath for 1 hour; then an additional 10.8 g. (0.10 mole) of ethyl bromide is added and the heating continued for an additional 3 hours. The solvent and residual ethyl bromide are removed to reduced pressure (water aspirator) while the flask is heated in a water bath kept at about 60\u00b0 (Note 1). The oily residue is treated with about 300 ml. of absolute ether, and on scratching crystallization is induced. The product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 50-ml. portions of anhydrous ether, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of colorless 2-methylbenzylethyldimethylammonium bromide is 47.5\u201349.0 g. (92\u201395%) (Note 2). It is hygroscopic and should therefore not be exposed to moist air.\nIn a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser capped with a calcium chloride drying tube, are placed 38.7 g. (0.15 mole) of the quaternary ammonium bromide (Note 3) described above, 24.6 g. (0.3 mole) of fused sodium acetate, and 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 24 hours (Note 4) and then allowed to cool. It is transferred to a large beaker (Note 5), 250 ml. of water is added, and the acid is partially neutralized by the addition of 84 g. of solid sodium bicarbonate. The mixture is extracted with three 75-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether solutions are washed with two or more 50-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution until all the acetic acid has been removed. The ether layer is then washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of colorless liquid acetate, b.p. 119\u2013121\u00b0/15 mm. or 129\u2013131\u00b0/31 mm., is 21.6\u201322.4 g. (88\u201391%), nD25 1.5041\u20131.5045 (Note 6).\nB. o-Methylbenzyl alcohol. A solution of 5 g. (0.12 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 50 ml. of water is added to a solution of 16.4 g. (0.1 mole) of 2-methylbenzyl acetate (prepared as described above, part A) in 50 ml. of methanol contained in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 hours, cooled, diluted with 50 ml. of water, and extracted with three 75-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 50 ml. of water and 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation, finally at reduced pressure to remove the last traces of methyl alcohol, and the residue is dissolved in 50 ml. of boiling 30\u201360\u00b0 petroleum ether. The colorless crystals obtained on cooling, finally in the ice bath, are collected by suction filtration, washed with a few milliliters of cold petroleum ether, and air-dried. Concentration of the mother liquors to 6\u20137 ml. and cooling gives an additional crop. The total yield of product melting between 33\u201334\u00b0 and 35\u201336\u00b0 is 11.6\u201311.8 g.

            "A. Benzyltrimethylammonium iodide. A solution of 135 g. (1 mole) of N,N-dimethylbenzylamine (Note 1) in 200 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol (Note 2) is placed in a three-necked flask fitted with a 125-ml. dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a rubber slip-sleeve-sealed stirrer. The openings of the dropping funnel and condenser are protected from atmospheric moisture with drying tubes. While the solution is stirred rapidly, 190 g. (1.34 moles) of methyl iodide contained in the dropping funnel is added slowly at first, then at such a rate as to cause gentle refluxing of the solution. After the addition is complete (30 minutes), the solution is boiled under reflux on the steam bath for 30 minutes more and transferred to a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask with the aid of an additional 25-ml. of absolute ethanol for rinsing. On cooling to room temperature a large portion of the methiodide crystallizes, and the remaining material is then precipitated by the addition of 1 l. of anhydrous ether with stirring (Note 3). The product is separated by suction filtration, washed with two 100-ml. portions of anhydrous ether (Note 4), and dried in air at room temperature. The yield of benzyltrimethylammonium iodide, m.p. 178\u2013179\u00b0 (dec.), is 260\u2013274 g. (94\u201399%), and is pure enough for most purposes (Note 5).\nB. 2-Methylbenzyldimethylamine. (Caution! This preparation should be conducted in a good hood to avoid exposure to ammonia). To 800 ml. of liquid ammonia contained in a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a rubber slip-sleeve-sealed wire stirrer and an air-cooled reflux condenser, sodium is added in small pieces until the blue color persists (Note 6). At this point 0.5 g. of granulated ferric nitrate is added, and then 27.8 g. (1.2 g. atoms) of sodium (cut into approximately 0.5-g. pieces), is introduced at such a rate that stirring is not hindered. After all the sodium has been added (about 15 minutes), the mixture is stirred until the blue color disappears and the grayish-black suspension of sodium amide remains (15\u201320 minutes). Stirring is discontinued, and the mixture is swirled to wash down the mirror of sodium which forms on the upper walls of the flask (Note 7).\nA 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 277 g. (1 mole) of benzyltrimethylammonium iodide (prepared as described in Part A) and is connected with a short section of large-diameter rubber tubing to the third neck of the flask containing the sodium amide. Stirring is started, and the salt is shaken in at a steady rate and as rapidly as possible without serious loss of material through the condenser. This operation requires about 10\u201315 minutes (Note 8). The greenish-violet color, which is first produced by addition of the salt, persists for about 15 minutes after all the material has been added. During this and the subsequent reaction period, more ammonia is added as necessary to maintain the original volume. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours, and then 27 g. (0.5 mole) of ammonium chloride is added cautiously to destroy excess sodium amide.\nThe flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, and enough (about 100 ml.) water is added, dropwise at first, to bring all the solid material into solution. The mixture is stirred until it reaches room temperature, 70 ml. of ether is added, and the organic layer is separated. The water layer is extracted with two 70-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether solutions are washed with two 50-ml. portions of saturated salt solution and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration and removal of the ether by distillation, the amine is distilled through a 10-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction, b.p. 72\u201373\u00b0/9 mm.., 97\u201399\u00b0/13 mm., or 197\u2013198\u00b0/atm., amounts to 134\u2013141.5 g. (90\u201395% yield), nD20 1.5050\u20131.5060 (Note 8). On redistillation all but about 5% of the material is recovered, b.p. 78\u201379\u00b0/12 mm., nD20 1.5049\u20131.5052."

They are separated by suction filtration at 0\u00b0 (Note 13) and quickly rinsed with a very little ice-cold methanol. The product is hygroscopic and is quickly pressed between filter paper, then dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The filtrates yield a further crop on partial evaporation under reduced pressure, the total recovery of recrystallized material being 85\u201390% (Note 14)."

The flask is charged with 150 ml. of mineral oil (Note 2), and the system is thoroughly swept out with a slow stream of carbon dioxide admitted through the gas inlet tube while the flask is heated with an electric heating mantle. When the temperature of the oil reaches 240\u2013250\u00b0, a slurry of 90 g. (0.51 mole) of powdered anhydrous disodium methylsuccinate (Note 3) and 100 g. (0.287 mole) of phosphorus heptasulfide (Note 4) in 250 ml. of mineral oil is placed in the addition funnel. With efficient stirring and a slow continuous stream of carbon dioxide passing through the system, the slurry is added to the hot mineral oil at such a rate as to effect fairly rapid distillation of 3-methylthiophene accompanied by considerable gas evolution (mostly hydrogen sulfide). During the addition, which requires about 1 hour, the temperature is maintained at 240\u2013250\u00b0 (Note 5). The temperature is then raised to 275\u00b0 and stirring continued in the inert atmosphere for an additional hour or until distillation ceases. The total distillate, amounting to 33\u201338 ml., is washed with two 50-ml. portions of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and finally with 50 ml. of water (Note 6). The crude 3-methylthiophene is then distilled (Note 7). A small fore-run is discarded, and the fraction boiling between 112\u00b0 and 115\u00b0 is collected. The yield is 26\u201330 g. (52\u201360%), n25D 1.5170 \u00b1 0.0005 (Note 8), (Note 9), and (Note 10)."

The crude precipitate is separated by suction filtration and thoroughly washed with cold water until the washings no longer show any chrome green color. The precipitate is triturated with three 300-ml. portions of boiling water and filtered to remove the diphenic acid formed in the reaction. The precipitate is then triturated with several (4\u20136) 300-ml. portions of hot 40% sodium bisulfite solution and again filtered (Note 5). The insoluble material is a mixture of anthraquinone and some resinous products derived from anthracene and other contaminants present in the starting material (Note 6).

The lower end of the reaction tube is fitted with a Friedrichs condenser and receiver. A thermocouple well, concentric with the reaction tube, is passed through the upper end by means of a standard ground-glass joint. The tube is packed with 200 ml. of 4- to 8-mesh alumina (Note 1) held in place by a plug of glass wool supported by indentations in the tube, followed by 100 ml. of marble chips which serve as a vaporizer and preheater for the reactants. The reaction tube is supported in an electrically heated furnace (Note 2) extending from the inlet tube to the joint connecting the condenser.\nFig. 15.\nThe reaction tube is heated to 330\u2013340\u00b0 (Note 3) and is swept out with a stream of nitrogen gas. A solution of 258 g. (3 mole) of tetrahydropyran (Note 4) and 559 g. (6 mole) of aniline is then placed in the graduated funnel and introduced into the reaction tube at a rate of 90\u2013100 ml. per hour. The product, which is collected in a 1-l. flask containing 10 g. of sodium chloride, consists of a light-yellow oil and a lower aqueous layer. After the addition of the reactants is complete, a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the reaction tube for 20\u201330 minutes to remove any product adsorbed on the catalyst. The lower aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the upper organic layer is dried over sodium hydroxide pellets. The product is fractionated under reduced pressure using a Whitmore-Lux column2 (Note 5) only to remove the small amount of unchanged tetrahydropyran and excess aniline. The column is permitted to drain, and the residue is distilled from an ordinary Claisen flask under reduced pressure. 1-Phenylpiperidine is obtained as a colorless or very light-yellow liquid, b.p. 123\u2013126\u00b0/12.5 mm., 133\u2013136\u00b0/21 mm., nD25 1.5603.

(1.1 moles) of dry o-xylene (Note 2). An ultraviolet lamp such as a General Electric R.S. Reflector Type 275-watt sun lamp is placed about 1 cm. from the flask so as to admit the maximum amount of light. The stirrer is started, and the o-xylene is heated to 120\u00b0 with an electric heating mantle. A total of 700 g. (4.4 moles) of bromine (N.F. grade) is added in portions from the dropping funnel to the reaction flask at such a rate that the bromine color is removed as fast as it is added. After approximately one-half of the bromine has been added, the temperature is slowly increased to 175\u00b0 for the remainder of the addition; the mixture becomes very dark toward the end of the reaction. The bromine can be added rapidly at first, but toward the end it must not be added at a rate exceeding 4\u20135 drops per minute in order to avoid loss of a visible amount of bromine with the evolved hydrogen bromide. After all the bromine has been added (10\u201314 hours), the mixture is illuminated and stirred at 170\u00b0 for 1 hour. After removal of the stirrer, etc., the mixture is cooled and allowed to stand overnight to crystallize in the reaction flask exposed to the air.\nThe dark, solid tetrabromide is dissolved in 2 l. of hot chloroform (Note 3) and treated with 100 g. of 325-mesh Norit.

The solid product is collected on a cold B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with a small amount of cold chloroform. The filtrate is concentrated further and cooled to obtain a second crop of crystals, which is purified by recrystallization from chloroform. The yield of the tetrabromide obtained from the first crop (white) and second crop after recrystallization (light tan) is 344\u2013370 g. (74\u201380%), m.p. 115\u2013116\u00b0.",

            "A. Sodium \u03b2-styrenesulfonate. In a 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a drying tube, a sealed stirrer, and a ground-glass stopper, is placed 800 ml. of ethylene chloride (Note 1). The flask with fittings is weighed and then connected through the third neck to a sulfur trioxide distillation apparatus (Note 2). Sulfur trioxide is distilled into the flask until about 300 g. has been collected. During the distillation the flask is cooled with a large pan of cold water (Note 3). The distillation is stopped, the condenser is disconnected and replaced by the glass stopper, and the flask is again weighed.\nThe stopper is replaced by a thermometer, and the other side neck is equipped with a two-way adapter to hold a dropping funnel and a drying tube. The sulfur trioxide solution is cooled below \u22125deg; with an ice-salt bath, then an amount of dioxane (Note 4) equivalent to the sulfur trioxide is added slowly with vigorous stirring at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 5\u00b0 (Note 5).\nOne molar equivalent of styrene (Note 6) dissolved in 2 volumes of ethylene chloride is added with stirring to the suspension of dioxane sulfotrioxide. The temperature is maintained below 10\u00b0 during the hour required for addition, during which the suspension of colorless solid changes to a milky tan solution. The cooling bath is removed, and stirring is continued for an additional hour. After standing overnight, the nearly clear yellow solution is heated under reflux for 2 hours on the steam bath. The solution, now dark brown, is allowed to cool, is poured into 3 l. of ice water, and is stirred or shaken to ensure transfer of the sulfonic acid to the water (Note 7). The emulsion is neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution (Note 8), the layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 500-ml. portions of isopropyl ether (Note 9).\nSeveral crops of crystals are now taken by evaporating the aqueous solution to the saturation point on a hot plate with stirring, then cooling. Each crop is dried for 2 hours at 100\u00b0 and analyzed for unsaturation by the bromate-bromide titration method (Note 10). The first two crops usually total about 380 g. (based on 300 g. of sulfur trioxide), 49% yield, and are about 95% pure by titration. They may be further purified by one recrystallization from water, with about 80% recovery of 99 + % pure salt.\nThe third crop generally weighs about 100 g. and is about 80% pure; the fourth crop weighs about 75 g., and is about 60% pure (Note 11). For purification, the third crop is recrystallized from the mother liquor resulting from the recrystallization of the combined first and second crops; the fourth crop is recrystallized from the third-crop mother liquor. An additional recrystallization from water is usually required to obtain material of 95 + % purity.\nThe total weight of 95 + % pure sodium \u03b2-styrenesulfonate from 300 g. of sulfur trioxide is 450\u2013500 g. (58\u201365% yield) (Note 12) and (Note 13).\nB. \u03b2-Styrenesulfonyl chloride. One hundred grams of dry sodium \u03b2-styrenesulfonate (Note 14) is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask and thoroughly mixed with 120 g. of powdered phosphorus pentachloride with vigorous shaking. The flask is attached to a reflux condenser capped with a drying tube and heated on the steam bath until the reaction mixture liquefies, then for an additional 4 hours. The phosphorus oxychloride is removed by distillation at reduced pressure (water aspirator) on the steam bath. The semisolid residue is extracted three times by boiling for 15 minutes with 100-ml. portions of chloroform. The residue in the flask is dissolved in 200 ml. of ice water and extracted with 100 ml. of chloroform. The combined chloroform solutions are washed with 200 ml. of water, two 100-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate, and finally with 100 ml. of water. After drying for 2 hours over calcium chloride, the solution is treated with 3 g. of Norit, filtered, and concentrated to 150 ml., and 200 ml. of 60\u201368\u00b0 petroleum ether is added. On cooling, 81\u201386 g. (83\u201388% yield) of \u03b2-styrenesulfonyl chloride separates as colorless needles, m.p. 88\u201390\u00b0. Recrystallization raises the melting point to 89\u201390\u00b0 (Note 15), (Note 16), and (Note 17)."

The pot residue is a slightly viscous amber-colored oil which weighs 225\u2013235 g. and consists of about 80% tetralin hydroperoxide (Note 5). To obtain the pure hydroperoxide the residue is dissolved in 450 ml. of toluene and the solution is cooled to \u221250\u00b0 with stirring (Note 6). After standing at \u221250\u00b0 for 1 hour, the slurry is separated by suction filtration (Note 7) and the precipitate is dried at room temperature at 1\u20132 mm. There is thus obtained 120\u2013125 g. of moderately pure tetralin hydroperoxide, m.p. 50.2\u201352.0\u00b0, active oxygen content 9.20% (Note 8). Recrystallization from 480 ml. of toluene at \u221230\u00b0 yields 80\u201385 g. (44\u201357% yield based on the peroxide content of the oxidized tetralin) of pure tetralin hydroperoxide as a colorless solid, m.p. 54.0\u201354.5\u00b0, active oxygen content, 9.70% (Note 9)."

            "To 179 g. (109 ml., 1.5 moles) of thionyl chloride (Note 1) contained in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask, 42.8 g. (0.2 mole) of powdered sodium p-toluenesulfinate dihydrate2 (Note 1) is added in portions at room temperature over a 10- to 15-minute period. A vigorous reaction occurs with the evolution of hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. As the first portions of the sulfinate are added, the temperature of the reaction mixture rises, but it soon drops to approximately 0\u00b0 as the addition proceeds (Note 2). The resulting reaction mixture, a clear yellow liquid containing a white opaque solid, is protected from atmospheric moisture by means of a calcium chloride drying tube and is set aside at room temperature for 1.5\u20132 hours. During this time slight effervescence continues (Note 3) and the white opaque suspended material gradually disintegrates to a finely divided translucent deposit.\nThe excess thionyl chloride is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (15\u201320 mm.) with the bath temperature below 50\u00b0, and the last traces are eliminated by one or two evaporations under reduced pressure after the addition of 50-ml. portions of anhydrous ether (Note 4). The residue consists of a viscous yellow oil containing a suspension of white granular inorganic solid. The crude sulfinyl chloride is readily dissolved by three successive treatments with portions of anhydrous ether (50, 30, and 30 ml., respectively) which are decanted without difficulty from most of the inorganic residue (Note 5). Removal of the solvent by distillation at reduced pressure leaves the sulfinyl chloride as a clear, pale, straw-yellow oil. The yield is 30\u201332 g. (86\u201392%) (Note 6). Distillation at reduced pressure (Note 5) yields p-toluenesulfinyl chloride as a deep yellow mobile oil, b.p. 113\u2013115\u00b0/3.5 mm. or 99\u2013102\u00b0/0.5 mm. (Note 7). The yield of redistilled material is 23\u201326 g. (66\u201374%). A small quantity (2\u20133 g.) of a dark tarry residue remains in the distilling flask."

            "A total of 320 g. (1.68 moles) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 1) is divided into three portions of 190, 90, and 40 g.; and a solution of alkali is prepared by dissolving 70 g. of sodium hydroxide in 70 ml. of water with cooling. The 190-g. portion of the sulfonyl chloride is added with swirling during about 5 minutes to 210 ml. (2.1 moles) of 33% aqueous methylamine (or 174 ml. of the 40% solution) contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is allowed to heat up to 80\u201390\u00b0 in order to maintain the sulfonylmethylamide (m.p. 78\u00b0) in a molten condition (Note 2). After all this portion of the sulfonyl chloride has been added, the mixture is shaken vigorously. Boiling is prevented by mild cooling with water in order to avoid an excessive loss of methylamine.\nAs soon as the mixture has become acidic (Note 3), as indicated by testing a drop on litmus paper, 50 ml. of the 50% sodium hydroxide solution is added carefully with swirling. This is followed immediately by gradual addition of the 90-g. portion of the sulfonyl chloride as before. When the mixture has again become acidic (Note 3), 25 ml. of the sodium hydroxide solution is added, followed by the final 40 g. of the sulfonyl chloride. After the mixture has again become acidic, the remainder of the sodium hydroxide solution is added. The liquid phase of the final mixture should be alkaline (Note 4).\nAfter the walls of the flask have been rinsed with a little water, the reaction is completed by heating the mixture, consisting of two layers and a precipitate of sodium chloride, on a steam bath for 15 minutes with vigorous mechanical stirring. The hot reaction mixture (Note 2) and (Note 5) is then poured into 1.5 l. of glacial acetic acid contained in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, and the smaller flask is rinsed clean with 250 ml. of acetic acid (Note 6). The solution is cooled in an ice bath to about 5\u00b0 (Note 7) and stirred mechanically as a solution of 124 g. (1.8 moles) of sodium nitrite in 250 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel during about 45 minutes. The temperature of the mixture is kept below 10\u00b0, and stirring is continued for 15 minutes after addition is complete. During the reaction, the nitroso compound separates as a yellow crystalline product.\nOne liter of water is added to the mixture; then the precipitate is separated by suction filtration, pressed on the funnel, and washed with about 500 ml. of water. The product is transferred to a beaker, stirred well with about 500 ml. of cold water, then filtered and washed again on the funnel. This process is again repeated if necessary to remove the odor of acetic acid. After drying to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid, the product melts in the range between 55\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 (Note 8). The yield is 306\u2013324 g.

            "Caution! o-Xylylene dibromide is a powerful and persistent lachrymator. The preparation and all subsequent handling of this substance should, therefore, be carried out in an efficient hood with adequate protection by rubber gloves. A gas mask should be at hand for emergency. All apparatus coming in contact with the dibromide should be immersed in alcoholic alkali contained in a large crock with a lid. A period of 24 hours is sufficient for decontamination. Waste substances such as filter paper and corks usually require several days of such soaking before they can be safely discarded.\nA 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber slip-sleeve-sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel with the tip extended to reach almost to the bottom of the flask (Note 1), and an efficient condenser leading to a gas absorption trap.2 o-Xylene (106 g., 1 mole) (Note 2) is placed in the flask, which is heated with an oil bath and illuminated with a sun lamp (Note 3) placed 1\u20135 cm. from the upper portion of the flask. When the temperature of the o-xylene reaches 125\u00b0, the dropwise addition of 352 g. (2.2 moles) of bromine is commenced with stirring. The rate of addition is regulated so that all the bromine is introduced in 1.5 hours. The mixture is stirred at 125\u00b0 under illumination for an additional 30 minutes. It is then allowed to cool to 60\u00b0 and poured into 100 ml. of boiling 60\u201368\u00b0 petroleum ether contained in a beaker, the transfer being assisted with small amounts of warm solvent. As the homogeneous solution cools slowly to room temperature it is stirred frequently to prevent caking of the brown crystalline product that separates. After the mixture is cool and the bulk of the dibromide has crystallized, the beaker is placed in a refrigerator for 12 hours (Note 4). The product is then separated by suction filtration, washed twice with 25-ml. portions of cold petroleum ether, and then pressed on the filter until nearly dry. Final drying is effected in a vacuum desiccator containing solid potassium hydroxide. The brown crystalline product amounts to 123\u2013140 g. (48\u201353% yield), the melting point ranging between 89\u00b0 and 94\u00b0 (Note 5)."

(107 ml., 1 mole) of o-toluidine (Note 1) is introduced from the dropping funnel. The mixture becomes very warm. After the amine has been completely added, the solution is cooled to 12\u201313\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath (Note 2). During the cooling, the dropping funnel and condenser are replaced by another dropping funnel containing 126 ml. (2 moles) of 70% nitric acid and a thermometer which can be read to within 0.5\u00b0 in the range from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 (Note 3).\nThe nitric acid is added drop by drop to the cold slurry at a rate which maintains the temperature carefully within the limits of 10\u201312\u00b0 (Note 4). If the temperature persists in dropping, the addition is stopped after about 5 minutes. The ice bath is removed until the temperature rises 0.5\u00b0, the ice-salt bath is replaced, and addition is continued. As the reaction progresses, the acetotoluide which may have precipitated redissolves, and the solution becomes deeply colored. The addition is complete in 1\u20132 hours, and the nitro compounds may start to separate.\nThe solution is poured, with stirring, into 3 l. of ice water. The mixture of 4- and 6-nitroacetotoluides precipitates as a creamcolored solid which is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel. After thorough washing with four 500-ml. portions of ice water, the precipitate is partly dried by suction (Note 5). The moist product is then placed in a steam-distillation apparatus (Note 6), covered with 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and heated until the mixture boils. The acetotoluides are rapidly hydrolyzed, and the solution becomes dark red. Steam is then introduced, and the distillation is thus continued until 36 l. of distillate has been collected (Note 7) and (Note 8). The 2-amino-3-nitrotoluene, which separates as bright orange needles when the distillate is cooled, is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The dried product amounts to 75\u201384 g.

The mixture is boiled for 15 minutes after completion of the addition, then a solution of 110 g. (0.66 mole) of ethyl sec-butylidenecyanoacetate in 130 ml. of benzene is added over a 30-minute period with spontaneous reflux. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for an additional hour. A precipitate separates after about 30 minutes.\nThe reaction mixture is poured onto about 400 g. of cracked ice and is made acidic with 20% sulfuric acid. After two clear phases have formed the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, and the lower layer is removed. This aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene and discarded. The three organic extracts are washed separately and successively with 125 ml. of water and 125 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, then filtered successively through a layer of anhydrous sodium sulfate.\nThe combined extract (about 1 l.) is flash-distilled at atmospheric pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask. After the solvent and a small amount of fore-run (ca. 15 g., b.p. 45\u00b0/3 mm.) have been removed, the product is distilled to yield 157\u2013162 g.

In a 1-l. three-necked flask (Note 1) equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a gas outlet leading to a hood or trap are placed 100 g. (0.5 mole) of p-bromoacetophenone (Note 2) and 300 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled to 20\u00b0, and a solution of 26 ml. (0.5 mole) of bromine in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise (Note 3). Crystals of the mono-\u03b1-brominated derivative separate during the addition, which requires about 30 minutes. When the addition is completed, a second solution of 26 ml. (0.5 mole) of bromine in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise. Slight heating may be necessary to keep the reaction proceeding, as indicated by decolorization of the bromine, but the temperature should be kept as near 20\u00b0 as possible. During the addition, which requires about 30 minutes, the solid dissolves and crystals of the di-\u03b1,\u03b1-brominated derivative appear toward the end of the addition. The flask is heated to dissolve the contents, which are transferred, preferably in a hood, to a 1-l. beaker and cooled rapidly by means of an ice-water bath (Note 4). The mixture is filtered with suction (Note 5), and the solid is washed with 50% ethanol until colorless. The air-dried product has a slight pink cast and melts at 89\u201391\u00b0. The yield is 130\u2013135 g. (73\u201375%) (Note 6). A pure, white solid melting at 92\u201394\u00b0 is obtained by recrystallization from ethanol, but the initial product is sufficiently pure for the next step.",

The mixture is stirred for 10\u201315 minutes, and the contents are transferred to a 1-l. wide-mouthed bottle. The mixing vessel is rinsed with 150\u2013200 ml. of ice-cold water. The material from the rinse is combined with the mixture in the bottle, and sufficient crushed ice is added to bring the temperature below 10\u00b0. One hundred milliliters of a chilled aqueous solution containing 50 g. of sodium hydroxide is added slowly while the bottle is rotated (Note 7). The contents are stored for approximately 4\u20135 days in a refrigerator (5\u00b0) and are shaken occasionally. During this time most of the solid dissolves, but a slight amount remains as a yellow sludge and the liquid assumes a yellow to amber color. The mixture is filtered, and the insoluble material is discarded. An excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate. The entire resulting mixture containing a white solid is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered into a 1-l. flask. The ether is carefully removed by distillation using a hot-water bath to give a yellow oil which solidifies when cooled. The product is recrystallized from 500 ml. of benzene. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with benzene until the filtrate is colorless. The air-dried product (Note 8) weighs 40\u201348 g.

(0.60 g. atom) of freshly sand-papered zinc foil cut into narrow strips, and 1.2 l. of benzene previously dried over sodium are added to the flask. To dry the apparatus and contents, 300 ml. of benzene is slowly distilled from the flask with stirring. Heating is interrupted, and the condenser is quickly arranged for reflux and fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. To the flask are added rapidly with stirring 38.9 g. (0.40 mole) of n-capronitrile (Note 1) and 125.4 g. (0.60 mole) of sec-butyl \u03b1-bromopropionate (Note 2). Refluxing is resumed, and after a 3\u20135 minute induction period blackening of the zinc surface and clouding of the solution are noted as the first signs of reaction. Heating is maintained a total of 45 minutes, after which the solution is cooled for 15 minutes in an ice bath (Note 3).\nTo the cooled solution is added with vigorous stirring 400 ml. of ice-cold 12N sulfuric acid. The ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued at room temperature for a total of 2 hours (Note 4). The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel; after separation, the aqueous lower layer is drained into a 2-l. separatory funnel containing 800 ml. of water which has been used to wash the reaction flask. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with 200-ml. portions of benzene which have also been employed to rinse the reaction flask. The original organic layer and the combined benzene extracts are kept separate and are washed successively with 400-ml. portions of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and again with water. The two organic portions are combined and allowed to stand over anhydrous sodium sulfate until clear. The solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure by flash distillation through a fractionating column (Note 5). For this operation, a side-arm distilling flask equipped with a dropping funnel is heated by an oil bath whose temperature is maintained at 140\u2013150\u00b0. After all the solvent has been added, the dropping funnel is replaced by a capillary, and the last of the solvent is removed at reduced pressure furnished by a water pump. Finally, an oil pump is attached and the product is fractionated at about 5 mm. pressure (Note 6).

            "A. Apparatus. The reduction is carried out in a 400-ml. beaker. The anode, a cylinder of sheet lead 3 in. in height and 2.25 in. in diameter, rests on the bottom of the beaker. Clamped inside the anode and extending almost to the bottom of the beaker is the catholyte chamber, a porous cup (Note 1) 5 in. deep and 1.75 in. in diameter. Clamped securely inside the cup and about 0.25 in. above its inside bottom surface is the cathode, a cylinder of 25-gauge sheet copper 6 in. long and 1.25 in. in diameter. It is provided with a row of seven vertical slots 0.25 in. wide and 1.25 in. long, evenly spaced around its circumference; the lower ends of the slots are about 2.5 in. from the bottom of the cathode (Note 2). Both electrodes are provided with binding posts for connection to the circuit. A stirrer is constructed with two double propeller blades attached to the shaft, one about 1.5 in. above the other, at a pitch that will direct the flow of liquid downward. The mechanically driven stirrer is set to run deep inside the cathode (Note 3).\nThe current may be drawn from a commercially available battery charger (Note 4) or from a storage battery, each capable of operating at about 6 volts. Experiment has shown that the considerable ripple in the output of the charger has no adverse effect on the reduction. A transformer in the input to the charger, or a variable resistance in the battery circuit, and a 0\u20133 ampere range d.c. ammeter complete the apparatus.\nB. Reduction of o-chloronitrobenzene. The stirrer is set in position carefully inside the cathode, which is clamped in place at the top. The porous cup, previously impregnated with the electrolyte, is charged with 11.5 g. (0.073 mole) of o-chloronitrobenzene (Note 5) and about 80 ml. of a mixture of acetic acid (70 ml.), concentrated sulfuric acid (22 ml.), and water (8 ml.) (Note 6). The cup is then clamped securely in position, and the beaker containing the anode is supported just clear of the bottom of the porous cup and filled with the same solution of aqueous sulfuric and acetic acids to the same level as the liquid inside the cup. The stirrer is started, the current turned on, and the system observed for a few minutes until the current has become stable. It is then adjusted at some convenient value no greater than 2 amperes.\nThe temperature will rise slowly and should be maintained at 30\u201345\u00b0 throughout the reduction, with cooling as necessary. The system requires no attention while in operation except for occasional inspection and possibly the addition of a few milliliters of 90% acetic acid to maintain the surface of the catholyte at the desired level (Note 7).\nC. Oxidation of 4-amino-3-chlorophenol. When the reduction is complete (Note 8), the system is disassembled, the catholyte poured into a flask, and the apparatus rinsed with hot water into the same flask. The combined catholyte and washings are extracted with ether in a continuous-type liquid-liquid extractor to remove the acetic acid almost completely (Note 9). The residual aqueous acid solution of the aminophenol (Note 10) is made up to 4N in sulfuric acid by adding 20 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and diluting with water to 400 ml.\nAt room temperature there is added in one portion a solution of 11 g. (0.037 mole, 50% excess over the theoretical amount) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 20 ml. of water. A rise in temperature of some 6\u20137\u00b0 will be observed; it is desirable to moderate the temperature by external cooling if it should rise above 35\u00b0.\nAfter the mixture has been allowed to stand at room temperature for at least an hour (Note 11), a few grams of clean sand is added and the dark red mixture is filtered with suction. The filtrate is extracted with ether (100 ml., then 4\u20135 portions of about 30 ml. each), and each extract is used in turn to extract the filter cake.\nThe ether extracts are combined; the ether is removed by distillation (Note 12), and the dark red tarry residue subjected to steam distillation. Some 40\u201350 ml. of distillate is collected after solid quinone no longer appears in the condenser (total volume about 150 ml.).\nThere is obtained by filtration 5.0\u20135.5 g. (48\u201353%) of yellow chloro-p-quinone of m.p. 53\u201355\u00b0; ether extraction of the filtrate yields a further 1.0 g., which brings the total yield to 58\u201363% (Note 12) and (Note 13). Crystallization from a small volume of aqueous ethanol (85\u201390%) raises the melting point to 55\u201356\u00b0."

            "A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with an internal thermometer, a sealed stirrer, and a reflux condenser, the upper end of which is protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. In this flask are placed 307 g. (2 moles) of dry, pulverized betaine hydrochloride (Note 1) and 285 g. (174 ml., 2.4 moles) of thionyl chloride. The mixture is stirred and heated slowly. When the internal temperature reaches 68\u00b0 copious evolution of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride occurs, and the mass becomes pasty. The temperature is maintained with stirring at 68\u201370\u00b0 for 1.5 hours (Note 2).\nWarm (80\u00b0) dry toluene (150 ml.) is added to the melt, and stirring is continued for 5 minutes. The entire mass is quickly poured into a dry beaker (Note 3) and slowly stirred, manually, until the entire mass has crystallized (Note 4). The cool toluene is decanted rapidly, and 150 ml. of warm toluene is added. The mixture is heated sufficiently to melt the crystals (about 68\u00b0), then allowed to cool again with stirring. The toluene is decanted once more, and 150 ml. of hot (60\u00b0) dry benzene is added. The mass is melted once more and cooled with stirring. The crystalline mass, with the benzene layer still covering it, is transferred rapidly to a B\u00fcchner funnel sufficiently large to hold all the contents of the beaker. The funnel is immediately covered with a rubber diaphragm, and suction is applied (Note 5). The crystals are quickly covered with 150 ml. of dry methylene chloride, dried with suction, and quickly transferred into a glass vacuum oven at 50\u00b0 (Note 6).

            "A 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 64 g. (10 oxygen equivalents) of sodium dichromate dihydrate and 225 ml. of acetic acid is heated and swirled until all the solid has dissolved, and then is cooled in an ice bath to bring the temperature of the solution to 15\u00b0. In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask 25 g. (0.065 mole) of commercial cholesterol is dissolved in 225 ml. of benzene by brief warming, and the solution is cooled to 20\u00b0; 225 ml. of acetic acid is added, the solution is cooled to 15\u00b0, and the dichromate solution (at 15\u00b0) is poured in, whereupon a thick orange paste of cholesteryl chromate, (C27H45O)2CrO2, separates. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath that is allowed to stand in a refrigerator for 40\u201348 hours. No stirring or other attention is required in this period; the temperature soon drops to 0\u00b0 (Note 1), and the chromate dissolves in a few hours.\nThe resulting brown solution is poured into a separatory funnel and shaken with 225 ml. of 30\u201360\u00b0 petroleum ether. After brief standing, the mixture when viewed against a strong light can be seen to have separated into a reddish upper hydrocarbon layer and a smaller, very dark lower layer containing chromium compounds and acetic acid. The lower layer is drawn off and discarded. Then 50 ml. of water is added to the hydrocarbon layer, and the mixture is shaken and allowed to settle. Another lighter-colored, lower layer is drawn off and discarded, and the process is repeated with 50 ml. more water. The hydrocarbon layer, now light in color, is then shaken with 110 ml. of Claisen's alkali (Note 2); this first portion neutralizes the residual acetic acid and acidic oxidation products and extracts some of the enedione as the yellow enolate. The funnel is allowed to stand, with occasional twirling, until the lower layer has settled to a clear yellow solution; the upper hydrocarbon layer acquires a dirty red-brown color. The extract is drawn off into a wide-mouthed 2-l. separatory funnel charged with 200 ml. of water, 600 g. of ice, 200 ml. of 36% hydrochloric acid, and 300 ml. of ether (Note 3). The hydrocarbon layer is extracted in the same way with five more 100-ml. portions of Claisen's alkali and then discarded (Note 4).\nAfter the last alkaline extract has been run into the receiving funnel, this is shaken and the aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The light-yellow ethereal layer is run into a smaller funnel and shaken with 100 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution and 30 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution (Note 5). This extraction is repeated a second time (Note 6). The carbonate extract is either discarded or worked up for recovery of acidic oxidation products (Note 7). The ethereal solution is finally shaken with 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, filtered into a round-bottomed flask (Note 8) by gravity through a paper containing 25 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. The residue is initially an oil, but when the last traces of solvent are removed by evacuating the flask (Note 8), reheating, and re-evacuating, it is obtained as a yellow solid (about 13 g.). This is taken up in 125 ml. of boiling methanol, and crystallization is allowed to proceed, first at room temperature and then at 0\u00b0. \u03944-Cholesten-3,6-dione separates in glistening, thin, yellow plates, m.p. 124\u2013125\u00b0; yield in the first crop, 9.0\u20139.3 g.

A portion (200 ml.) of the toluene is distilled from the flask (take-off cock open) in order to dry the system by azeotropic distillation; then 100 g. (0.26 mole) of cholesterol and 500 ml. of cyclohexanone (Note 1) are added to the flask. After an additional 50 ml. of toluene has been distilled, a solution of 28 g.

During this time toluene is distilled at a rate slightly greater than the rate of addition of catalyst solution, so that when the addition is complete about 600 ml. of toluene has distilled. An additional 300 ml. of toluene is distilled, and the murky orange-colored reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature.\nFour hundred milliliters of a saturated aqueous solution of potassium-sodium tartrate (Note 4) is added to the mixture, and the organic layer becomes clear and orange. The stirrer assembly is removed, and the mixture is steam-distilled until about 6 l. of distillate has been collected. The residual mixture is cooled and extracted successively with one 300-ml. portion and two 100-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform is removed by distillation on the steam bath at reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residual viscous amber oil (Note 5) is dissolved by heating in 150 ml. of methanol. When the solution has cooled to about 40\u00b0, seeds of cholestenone are added, and the flask is wrapped with a small towel to ensure slow cooling (Note 6).

(0.4 mole) of bromine is then added and the solution is poured with stirring into the cholesterol solution. The solution turns yellow and promptly sets to a stiff paste of dibromide. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath to 20\u00b0, and then the product is collected on a 16-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 3). The cake is pressed down and washed with acetic acid until the filtrate is completely colorless; 500 ml. is usually sufficient. A second crop of satisfactory dibromide is obtained by adding 800 ml. of water to the combined filtrate and washings, collecting the precipitate, and washing it with acetic acid until colorless. Dibromide moist with acetic acid is satisfactory for most transformations; dry dibromide, even when highly purified by repeated crystallization, begins to decompose (darkens) within a few weeks. When material prepared as described is dried to constant weight at room temperature, it is obtained as the 1:1 dibromide/acetic acid complex. Yields obtained in the first and second crops, respectively, are: 171\u2013186 g. and 13\u201325 g., total yield 197\u2013199 g. (84\u201385%) (Note 1).\nB. Cholesterol from the dibromide. The acetic acid-moist filter cake of dibromide from 150 g. of cholesterol is transferred (Note 3) to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and covered with 1.2 l. of U.S.P. ether, and the suspension is stirred mechanically above a bucket of ice and water that can be raised as required (Note 4), (Note 5). Forty grams (0.61 g. atom) of fresh zinc dust is added in the course of 5 minutes. The first 5- to 10-g. portion is added without cooling; when the reaction has started, as evidenced by solution of part of the dibromide and by ebullition, the cooling bath is raised during the remainder of the addition. At the end, the ice bath is lowered, and the mixture, which soon sets to a paste of white solid (Note 6), is stirred for 15 minutes longer. Then 50 ml. of water is added to dissolve the white solid, and the ethereal solution is decanted into a separatory funnel and washed with 400 ml. of water containing 25 ml. of 36% hydrochloric acid. After three more washings with 400-ml. portions of water, the solution is shaken thoroughly with 300 ml. of water and 150 ml. of 25% sodium hydroxide solution, and the ethereal solution is tested with moist blue litmus paper to make sure that all the acetic acid is removed (Note 7). The solution is then dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to a volume of 600 ml., methanol (600 ml.) is added, and the solution is evaporated to the point where crystallization just begins (about 1 l.). After standing at room temperature and then at 0\u20134\u00b0, the main crop of cholesterol is collected and dried at room temperature; yield 108\u2013110 g., m.p. 149.5\u2013150\u00b0 (Note 8). A second crop of 8.4\u201310.4 g., m.p. 148\u2013149\u00b0, is obtained after evaporation of the mother liquor to a volume of 250 ml. (Note 9); total yield 117\u2013120 g. (78\u201380% from commercial cholesterol) (Note 10).\nC. 5\u03b1,6\u03b2-Dibromocholestan-3-one. The moist dibromide from 150 g. of cholesterol (part A) is suspended in 2 l. of acetic acid in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and mounted over a bucket of ice and water that later can be raised to immerse the flask (Note 5). The suspension is stirred at room temperature (25\u201330\u00b0), and a solution, preheated to 90\u00b0, of 80 g. (2 oxygen equivalents) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 2 l. of acetic acid is poured in through a funnel (Note 3). The mixture reaches a temperature of 55\u201358\u00b0 during the oxidation, and all the solid dissolves in 3\u20135 minutes. After another 2 minutes the ice bucket is raised until the flask is immersed; stirring is then stopped, and the mixture is allowed to stand in the ice bath without disturbance for 10 minutes to allow the dibromoketone to separate in easily filterable crystals. With stirring resumed, the temperature is brought to 25\u00b0 and then, after addition of 400 ml. of water, to 15\u00b0. The product is collected on a 21-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filter cake is drained until the flow of filtrate amounts to no more than 25 drops per minute. The suction is released, the walls of the funnel are washed down with methanol, and 200 ml. of methanol is added. After a few minutes' standing, suction is applied and the crystals are drained thoroughly of solvent before they are washed in the same way with 200 ml. of fresh methanol. The last drops of filtrate should be completely colorless. Dried to constant weight at room temperature in a dark cupboard, the dibromoketone consists of shiny white crystals, m.p. 73\u201375\u00b0 (dec.), [\u03b1]D25 \u221247\u00b0 chloroform (c = 2.11) (Note 11); yield about 171 g. (96% in the oxidation or 81% from cholesterol).\nD. \u03945-Cholesten-3-one. (Note 12) The moist 5\u03b1,6\u03b2-dibromocholestan-3-one from 150 g. of cholesterol is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and covered with 2 l. of U.S.P. ether and 25 ml. of acetic acid. The suspension is stirred mechanically, and ice bath is raised into position (Note 5), and the temperature is brought to 15\u00b0. The ice bath is then lowered, and 5 g. of fresh zinc dust is added. As soon as the exothermic reaction of debromination sets in, the temperature is controlled to 15\u201320\u00b0 by cooling during the addition (in about 5 minutes) of 35 g. more zinc dust. The ice bath is then lowered, and the ethereal solution containing suspended zinc dust is stirred for 10 minutes longer. With continued stirring, 40 ml. of pyridine is added; this precipitates a white zinc salt (Note 13). The mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filter cake is washed well with ether. The colorless filtrate is washed with three 600-ml. portions of water and then shaken thoroughly with 600 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution until free from acetic acid as indicated by testing the ethereal solution with moist blue litmus paper. The solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to a volume of about 1 l.; 500 ml. of methanol is added, and the evaporation is continued until the volume is approximately 1.2 l. Crystallization is allowed to proceed at room temperature, then at 0\u20134\u00b0, and the large colorless prisms are collected by suction filtration; yield in the first crop 87\u201394 g., melting point in the range 124\u2013129\u00b0 (camphorlike odor), [\u03b1]D25 \u22122.5\u00b0 chloroform (c = 2.03), no selective absorption at 242 m\u03bc. Concentration of the mother liquor gives a second crop of 12\u201319 g. melting in the range 117\u2013125\u00b0 and suitable for conversion to \u03944-cholesten-3-one; total yield 106\u2013108 g. (71\u201372% from cholesterol).\nE. \u03944-Cholesten-3-one. A mixture of 100 g. of \u03945-cholesten-3-one (0.26 mole), 10 g. (0.11 mole) of anhydrous oxalic acid (Note 14), and 800 ml. of 95% ethanol is heated on the steam bath until all the solid is dissolved (15 minutes) and for 10 minutes longer, and then is allowed to stand at room temperature. If crystallization has not started after a period of several hours, the solution is seeded or scratched. After crystallization has proceeded at room temperature and then at 0\u20134\u00b0, the large, colorless, prismatic needles that separate are collected by suction filtration; yield in the first crop 88\u201392 g., m.p. 81\u201382\u00b0, [\u03b1]D25 92\u00b0 chloroform (c = 2.01); \u03bbmax.ethanol 242 m\u03bc (\u03b5 = 17,000). A second crop (5.0\u20137.5 g., melting in the range 78\u201382\u00b0) is obtained after concentration of the mother liquor to a volume of about 100 ml., and a third crop (3\u20134 g., low melting) by dilution with water. Recrystallization of these crops from 95% ethanol gives a total of 6.8\u20138.1 g. of satisfactory material, m.p. 81\u201382\u00b0; total yield 96\u201398 g. (68\u201369% over-all yield from cholesterol)."

            "A. 1,1,1',1'-Tetraethoxyethyl polysulfide (Note 1). In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and an addition funnel, 540 g. (2.25 moles) of sodium sulfide enneahydrate (Note 2) is dissolved in 2.7 l. of boiling 95% ethanol. Sulfur (144 g., 4.5 g. atoms) is added, and the solution is heated under reflux until it has assumed a deep-red color (10 minutes). The source of heat is removed, and 588 g. (3 moles) of diethyl bromoacetal (Note 3) is added over a period of about 30 minutes at such a rate that the solution boils gently. The mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 4 hours. During the last hour of heating, ethanol is allowed to distil from the reaction flask, and after the first 700 ml. of distillate is collected sodium bicarbonate (135 g.) (Note 4) is added to the reaction mixture. A total of 2.0\u20132.5 l. of ethanol is collected. Water (1.5 l.) is added, and the upper layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 250-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, three 100-ml. portions of water, and two 250-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, and are dried over potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is brought to constant weight by heating for about 1 hour on the steam bath at 10\u201315 mm. pressure. The orange liquid obtained in this way (Note 5) weighs 450\u2013500 g. and has n25D 1.515\u20131.517.",
            "B. Diethyl mercaptoacetal. A 12-l. three-necked flask, equipped with an efficient Hershberg stirrer, a Dry Ice condenser, and a stopper, is placed in an enameled container (Note 6). The flask is charged with 500 g. (1.38 moles, calculated as tetrasulfide) of 1,1,1',1'-tetraethoxyethyl polysulfide and 500 ml. of anhydrous ether. The condenser is filled with acetone and Dry Ice, and the contents of the flask are cooled by means of acetone and Dry Ice kept at \u221235\u00b0 to \u221245\u00b0. Liquid ammonia (Note 7) is introduced into the stirred solution until 4.5\u20135.0 l. has been added (Note 8). The solution is stirred for several minutes to ensure homogeneity, and 200 g. (8.7 g. atoms) of sodium is added in 2- to 5-g. lumps to the mixture over a period of 30\u201345 minutes. The last 2\u201310 g. of sodium causes the solution to turn deep blue. The mixture is stirred for 30 additional minutes, and ammonium chloride (about 200 g.) is cautiously added with stirring until the blue color is discharged. The cooling bath is removed and replaced by a bath of hot water into which steam may be introduced. The mixture is stirred while the ammonia is removed by distillation or evaporation (the distillation should be continued until the residue can no longer be stirred or is difficult to stir). The soft, semisolid mass containing small amounts of ammonia is cooled in ice, and 1 l. of ice-cold water is added with stirring. When most of the solid has dissolved, ice-cold hydrochloric acid is added cautiously, with frequent checks of the pH, until a pH of 8.0\u20138.5 is reached. The pH is then adjusted to 7.8\u20138.0 (preferably by a pH meter) by passing carbon dioxide into the cold solution (Note 9). The oil is separated from the aqueous layer, which is extracted with two 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and two 100-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride, and are dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled from a 500-ml. flask using a small Vigreux column or a Claisen head. The product (Note 10) weighs 320\u2013372 g. (77\u201390% yield, based on polysulfide; 71\u201383% yield, based on bromoacetal), boils at 62\u201364\u00b0/12 mm., and has n25D 1.4391\u20131.4400. The residue, 23\u201327 g., n25D 1.4702\u20131.4730, consists mainly of 1,1,1',1'-tetraethoxyethyl sulfide."

            "A 200-ml. three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer arranged to permit escape of gas, a thermometer, and a gas-inlet tube 10 mm. in diameter (Note 1), is placed in a vessel to which cooling water may be added. The entire apparatus is placed in a well-ventilated hood (Note 2). The flask is charged with 74 g. (0.25 mole) of dry (Note 3), molten (70\u00b0) tetraethylthiuram disulfide (Note 4). The molten mass is stirred vigorously, and chlorine is passed through a safety trap and is introduced below the surface of the liquid through the inlet tube. The reaction is exothermic, and the temperature is held at 70\u201375\u00b0 by adjusting the rate of chlorine addition and by surrounding the reaction flask with cold water. After approximately 6 g. of chlorine has been absorbed, the temperature is lowered to 50\u201355\u00b0 and held in this range for the remainder of the chlorination (Note 5). When about 90% of the theoretical amount of chlorine has been added, sulfur begins to precipitate and the reaction mass changes from a clear yellow-to-red solution to a cloudy yellow mixture. The reaction is considered complete when 18 g. (0.25 mole) of chlorine has been absorbed (measured by gain in weight of the reaction mixture). The time required for the chlorination is about 40 minutes.\nThe crude reaction product at 50\u00b0 consists of a reddish yellow upper layer of diethylthiocarbamyl chloride saturated with sulfur (Note 6) and a viscous lower layer of amorphous sulfur saturated with diethylthiocarbamyl chloride. The mechanical stirrer is replaced by a 6-in. glass-helix-packed column arranged for distillation. A magnetic stirrer is used throughout the distillation. The diethylthiocarbamyl chloride is distilled under reduced pressure, b.p. 80\u201385\u00b0/1 mm. (Note 7) and (Note 8), m.p. 48\u201351\u00b0. The yield is 71\u201372 g.

            "A 2-l. three-necked flask (Note 1), fitted with a sealed stirrer (Note 2) and an efficient reflux condenser (protected by a calcium chloride tube), is surrounded by a water bath. Sodium ethoxide is prepared in this flask by adding 31 g. (1.35 g. atoms) of sodium in portions to 450 ml. of absolute ethanol (Note 3). When practically all the sodium has dissolved, 50 g. (0.39 mole) of dichloroacetic acid is added with stirring at such a rate that the solvent refluxes smoothly. About 20 minutes is required. Sodium chloride soon begins to separate, and the solution becomes a yellow-orange color. After the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 3.5 hours.\nThe water is removed from the water bath and replaced by an ice-salt mixture. A thermometer is placed in the flask with the bulb below the surface of the liquid, and the mixture is cooled below 0\u00b0. Then a solution of about 27 g. (0.75 mole) of hydrogen chloride in 200 ml. of absolute ethanol (Note 4) is slowly added (Note 5) during about 40 minutes with stirring and cooling at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10\u00b0. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature, and the stirring is continued for 3 hours. It is then allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is again cooled to 0\u00b0, and the excess acid is neutralized to approximately pH 7 by slowly adding sodium ethoxide solution (Note 6). The mixture is tested from time to time during the addition of the alkali by placing a drop on moistened pH test paper. About 75 ml. of sodium ethoxide solution is required. The mixture is then filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 7), and the precipitate is extracted thoroughly with ether which is added to the alcoholic filtrate. The solid is discarded.\nMost of the solvent is removed by distillation through a Vigreux column under reduced pressure (about 40 mm.) and a pot temperature less than 40\u00b0. The product is then transferred to a smaller flask (Note 8). The remainder of the solvent is removed through the Vigreux column at a pressure of about 15 mm. and a boiling point up to about 40\u00b0. A Dry Ice-cooled receiver (Note 9) is then attached, and the pressure is lowered by means of a high-vacuum pump. The crude product is distilled until no more material comes over while the flask is heated on a steam bath. This crude product, b.p. 87\u201388\u00b0/17 mm., 69\u201370\u00b0/10 mm., nD25 1.4073\u20131.4076, may be redistilled, a pinch of calcium carbonate being added, through an efficient column (Note 10) at a pressure of about 12 mm. The fore-run (boiling point up to about 60\u00b0/12 mm.) is discarded. The fraction, b.p. 60\u201381\u00b0/12 mm., is saved for redistillation with a subsequent run. The main fraction is obtained at a boiling range of 81\u201383\u00b0/12 mm. The yield of ethyl diethoxyacetate is 31\u201334 g. (45\u201350%) of colorless liquid, nD25 1.4075."

The lower third of the flask is immersed in a steam bath, and the mixture is stirred vigorously until it turns to a viscous, homogeneous, brown liquid (1.7\u20132.3 hours). Stirring is interrupted, the steam bath is removed, and the stirrer is raised to a position just above the liquid (Note 1). Water (300 ml.) is added through the condenser to avoid loss of product during the addition. Potassium cyanide (610 g., 9.37 moles) and 260 ml. of water are then added through the third neck of the flask, and the mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes, during which the heavy brown liquid below the aqueous solution disappears and a brown layer of ethyl isocyanide appears above the aqueous solution. Stirring is discontinued, the reflux condenser is replaced by one arranged for distillation, and a thermometer extending into the aqueous layer is placed in the third neck. A receiver immersed in an ice bath is attached to the condenser, and the reaction mixture is heated by means of an electric heating mantle, causing a mixture of oil and water to distil. When the distillate contains almost no oil (Note 2), the distillation is discontinued (Note 3). The receiver contains about 200 ml. of crude ethyl isocyanide and 50 ml. of water. Sodium chloride (7 g.) is dissolved in the aqueous layer, and the ice-cold mixture is poured into a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and discarded. The ethyl isocyanide is washed with two 50-ml. portions of ice-cold saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and is dried overnight with 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

            "Caution! This preparation should be conducted in a good hood.\nA 250-ml. three-necked flask is equipped with a rubber-sealed mechanical stirrer, two gas-inlet tubes, and a mercury-sealed escape valve consisting of an outlet tube dipping into a test tube of mercury. A solution of 25 g. (0.14 mole) of benzophenone in 125 ml. of 95% ethanol is placed in the flask, which is cooled in an ice-salt freezing mixture. Hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen chloride are passed simultaneously into the stirred solution for 3 hours (Note 1). Within 1 hour the solution becomes blue. After 3 hours, the flow of hydrogen chloride is stopped and hydrogen sulfide alone is passed for a further 20 hours, with continued ice cooling. Toward the end of the reaction, the contents of the flask assume an intense violet color. The solid thiobenzophenone (23\u201325 g.) is filtered from the ice-cold solution in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide (Note 2), immediately dried under high vacuum (Note 3), and recrystallized twice from about 20 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201380\u00b0), giving long needles, m.p. 53\u201354\u00b0. The yield of purified product, is 18\u201321 g. (66\u201377%)."

            "Chlorine (Note 1) is passed into 300 ml. of anhydrous carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) contained in a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel protected from atmospheric moisture by a calcium chloride tube, and a gas-inlet tube equipped with a sintered-glass tip (Note 3). The amount of chlorine contained in the resulting yellow-green liquid, estimated volumetrically (Note 4), varies between 25 and 32 g. The gas-inlet tube is replaced by a calcium chloride tube, and the reaction vessel is cooled externally with ice water and protected from light by being covered with a towel.\nOne or two crystals of iodine are added to the chlorine solution, and a solution of p-toluenethiol (7.3 g. per 10 g. of dissolved chlorine, i.e., halogen in 140% excess) (Note 5) in 50 ml. of anhydrous carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) is added dropwise over a period of approximately 1 hour. The initial slight turbidity disappears gradually, a bright orange solution being formed (Note 6). After an additional 30 minutes' stirring, the solvent and excess chlorine are rapidly removed under reduced pressure at the lowest possible temperature (Note 7), the crude sulfenyl chloride being left as an orange-red mobile liquid (Note 8). For batches starting with 24.8 g. (0.2 mole) of p-toluenethiol, the yield varies between 27 and 30.5 g. (85\u201396%).\nRapid distillation under reduced pressure affords p-toluenesulfenyl chloride as a red mobile liquid boiling at 66\u201368\u00b0/0.8 mm. (74\u201376\u00b0/1.5 mm.; 82\u201384\u00b0/3.5 mm.) (Note 9). The yield of redistilled material varies between 24.5 and 28 g. (77\u201388%)."
