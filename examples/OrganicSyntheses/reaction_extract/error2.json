(0.500 mole) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Note 1) and 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The reaction flask is equipped with an efficient magnetic stirring bar, and chlorine gas is introduced through a safety trap into the well-stirred mixture (Note 2). During the course of the reaction, which should be completed in 35\u201340 minutes (Note 3), the mixture becomes homogeneous and warms to about 60\u00b0. The mixture is flushed with nitrogen to expel excess chlorine. During this process the product crystallizes from the solution; precipitation is completed by cooling the reaction mixture to 20\u00b0. The mixture is filtered, and the product is washed with 1 l. of water and air dried, yielding 112 g. (77%) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-5,6-dichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione, m.p. 125\u2013129\u00b0 (Note 4).",

Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. Over 1 hour, 91.5 g. (0.478 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 2) is added portionwise and with stirring to the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature at 0\u20135\u00b0. The resulting slurry is allowed to stand overnight (Note 3) in a refrigerator, then poured into 500 g. of an ice-water mixture. The reaction mixture is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are washed successively with four 150-ml. portions of 2 N sulfuric acid, 50 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and two 50-ml. portions of water. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator at 25\u00b0, yielding 76\u201388 g. (78\u201391%) of crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate as a pale yellow oil (Note 4).\nA dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. Sodium hydride dispersion (Note 5), [19.2 g. of a 50% w/w suspension in mineral oil, 9.6 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium hydride] is placed in the flask, and 100 ml. of anhydrous pentane is added. After the dispersion has been stirred, the sodium hydride is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is removed with a pipet or a siphon. This washing operation is repeated with two additional 100-ml. portions of pentane, and 400 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 6) is then added to the reaction flask. To the vigorously stirred suspension of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide is added, dropwise over 30 minutes, 68 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate (Note 7). The mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained before all of the previously prepared crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate, dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 6), is added in one portion. The resulting solution is slowly heated to 100\u00b0, with continuous stirring, over a period of 3 hours. During this time the reaction becomes dark red, and crystalline sodium p-toluenesulfonate separates. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, then transferred to a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual semisolid is mixed with 700 ml. of water and extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column. After removal of a low-boiling forerun, b.p. 54\u201357\u00b0 (0.2 mm.), containing mainly ethyl cyanoacetate, 34.5\u201338.4 g.

The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and 200 ml. of freshly distilled cyclohexane and 0.30 g. (0.0012 mole) of benzoyl peroxide are added to the flask. While a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the flask (Note 11), a solution of 5.00 g. (0.0270 mole) of ethyl (E)-2-cyano-6-octenoate in 800 ml. of freshly distilled cyclohexane is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred, refluxing benzoyl peroxide solution over a period of 40 hours (Note 10). Three additional 0.30-g. (0.0012-mole) portions of benzoyl peroxide (total: 1.2 g., 0.0050 mole, (Note 11)), are added at 12-hour intervals during the addition of the unsaturated ester. After the addition of the unsaturated ester and the benzoyl peroxide is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional 20 hours (Note 12). The resulting colorless to pale-yellow solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 200 ml., diluted with 250 ml. of ether, and washed with 100 ml. of aqueous saturated iron(II) sulfate to destroy any unchanged benzoyl peroxide. The organic layer is then washed successively with two 200-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and two 200-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 5-cm. Vigreux column. After separation of a 0.16\u20130.25-g.

Anhydrous chlorine (Note 2) is passed through the solution and introduced at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction solution does not rise above \u221210\u00b0 (Note 3). Completion of the addition process (ca. 1 hour) is indicated by a rapid development of a yellow color (excess chlorine) in the reaction solution and a distinct decrease in the temperature of the reaction mixture.

The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0\u00b0), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, then concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 122\u2013136 g. (65\u201372%) of a mixture of cis- and trans-3-chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid, boiling over the range 48\u201395\u00b0 (17\u201318 mm.) (Note 6), sufficiently pure for use in the next step (Note 7).",

(2.3 g.-atoms) of finely divided sodium (Note 8) and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. 3-Chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran (136 g., 1.01 moles) is added dropwise to the rapidly stirred, ethereal suspension of sodium. When the reaction commences (Note 9), the reaction mixture turns blue. After the reaction has started, the remaining chloro-ether is added, dropwise and with stirring over approximately 90 minutes, at such a rate that a brisk reflux is maintained. The resulting mixture, which remains dark blue throughout the addition of the chloro-ether, is refluxed with stirring for an additional hour (Note 10), then cooled in an ice\u2013salt bath. The cold reaction mixture is stirred vigorously as 30 ml. of absolute ethanol is added dropwise and with caution to the reaction mixture, after which, 700 ml. of water is added dropwise, with stirring and cooling. After the organic layer has been separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure.

Stirring is begun, and the remaining portions of these solutions are transferred to the appropriate dropping funnels. The metaperiodate solution is added over a period of about 30 minutes, and the permanganate solution is added as needed to maintain a pink color (Note 3). Stirring is continued for an additional 1.5 hours (Note 4) before a solution of 20.0 g. of sodium bisulfite in 40 ml. of water is slowly added (Note 5).

Stirring is continued for 4 hours at 2\u20134\u00b0, with the flask cooled with an ice-water bath. The reaction mixture is mixed thoroughly with 600 g. of ice, and the dimesylate precipitates. After careful acidification of the mixture with 6 N hydrochloric acid to approximately pH 3 (Note 21), the dimesylate is suction filtered, washed twice with 100-ml. portions of ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. This product, which is still moist, is transferred to a separatory funnel and is shaken well with 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted further with two 20-ml. portions of dichloromethane.

After 20\u201324 hours of stirring at room temperature two entirely clear layers can be observed upon the cessation of stirring (Note 22), indicating that the reaction is complete. The hydrazine hydrate is separated from the pentane and extracted with two 30-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane layers are filtered through cotton, which holds back any remaining droplets of hydrazine hydrate, into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask.

Three drops of acetic acid are added at first, and stirring is continued at 0\u00b0 until the precipitation of white 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate begins. If necessary, crystallization is initiated by scratching with a glass rod or by addition of a seed crystal from a previous run. The remainder of the acetic acid is added over a 10-minute period, and stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at 0\u00b0. The salt is filtered, washed with 30 ml. of pentane precooled to 0\u00b0, and dried in a vacuum desiccator (10 mm.) at room temperature, yielding 10.0\u201310.5 g.

Recrystallization is possible; however, it must be carefully carried out to avoid the formation of a yellow product, whose melting point is lower than that of the crude product. A solution of 10 g. of 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate in 40 ml. of dichloromethane is prepared at a maximum temperature of 20\u201322\u00b0.

            "A. Lithium phenylthio(tert-butyl)cuprate. A dry, 200-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, the top of which is connected to a nitrogen inlet. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 50 ml. of 1.60 M (0.080 mole) n-butyllithium (Note 1) solution is placed in the flask and cooled with an ice bath. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of 8.81 g. (0.0801 mole) of freshly distilled thiophenol (Note 2) in 30 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) is added dropwise to the cooled, stirred solution. An aliquot of the resulting solution (Note 4) is standardized by quenching in water, followed by titration with 0.10 N hydrochloric acid to a green end point with a bromocresol indicator. The concentration of lithium thiophenoxide prepared in this manner is typically 1.0 M.\nA dry, 250-ml., three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 5), a glass stopper, and a rubber septum through which are inserted hypodermic needles used to evacuate the flask and to admit nitrogen. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 4.19 g. (0.0220 mole) of purified copper(I) iodide (Note 6) is added, and while warming with a flame, the apparatus is evacuated, then refilled with nitrogen. After this procedure has been performed twice, the flask is allowed to cool, the stopper is replaced with a thermometer, and 45 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added (Note 3) with a hypodermic syringe. With continuous stirring, 22 ml. of 1.0 M (0.022 mole) lithium thiophenoxide solution is added with a syringe to the slurry of copper(I) iodide. After 5 minutes, the resulting yellow solution is cooled, with continuous stirring, to \u221265\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice cooling bath. Some copper(I) thiophenoxide usually separates from solution at ca. \u221245\u00b0. When the temperature of the mixture has reached ca. \u221265\u00b0, 13.6 ml. (0.0218 mole) of 1.60 M tert-butyllithium (Note 7) solution is added with a syringe to the stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture remains at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0. The resulting cloudy yellow-orange solution of the cuprate reagent is stirred at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0 for 5 minutes (Note 8).",

The resulting yellow-brown solution is stirred for 20 minutes (at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0) and quenched by the addition, with a syringe, of 5 ml. of anhydrous methanol. The red-orange reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then poured into 100 ml. of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride. The copious precipitate of copper(I) thiophenoxide is separated by suction filtration and washed thoroughly with several 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is washed with two 50-ml. portions of aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide and with one 50-ml. portion of aqueous 2% sodium thiosulfate. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted in turn with a fresh 50-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by distillation through a short Vigreux column.

A greenish precipitate is formed locally where the phosphine is added. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for 2 hours, during which time a heavy, greenish precipitate is formed. After cooling to room temperature, 600 ml. of ether (Note 10) is added, and the reaction mixture is left standing overnight, during which time the precipitate separates to the bottom of the flask. The solution is decanted into a 3-l. separatory funnel containing 300 ml. of 40% aqueous potassium hydroxide and 1 kg. of ice. The remainder of the reaction product is suction filtered with the aid of 1200 ml. of 5:1 ether\u2013dichloromethane through a 3-cm. layer of Celite\u00ae (Note 11).

(0.498 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 3) is added dropwise over 15\u201320 minutes while the temperature is kept at 0\u00b0. The mixture becomes reddish brown as it is stirred and cooled at 0\u00b0 for an additional 1 hour. The ice\u2013salt bath is removed and replaced by an ice-water bath. Stirring is continued as a solution of 100 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 400 ml. of water is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0 (Note 4). The two-phase mixture is stirred for another 30 minutes, after which water is added until the volume of the aqueous layer is brought to 1 l. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 250-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane solutions are combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and distillation of the remaining brown oil afford 43\u201344 g. (76\u201378%) of ethyl isocyanoacetate, b.p. 89\u201391\u00b0 (11 mm.) (Note 5).",
            "C. O-Ethyl thioformate. Caution! Hydrogen sulfide gas is highly toxic; this procedure should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube with a fritted-glass tip extending near to the bottom of the flask, and a gas-outlet connected to a scrubber flask containing 0.5\u20131.0 l. of aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide (Note 6). The flask is charged with 333 g. (2.25 moles) of triethyl orthoformate (Note 7), 330 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 3.2 g. of hydroquinone, and 0.4 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath as hydrogen sulfide gas is passed through the gas-inlet tube into the solution (Note 8). After the solution becomes saturated with hydrogen sulfide, the contents of the flask are poured into a 4-l. beaker containing a mechanically stirred mixture of 2.3 l. of ice and 340 ml. of diethyl ether. The mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, and the layers are separated. The organic layer is washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, two 100-ml. portions of water, three 80-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and two 80-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium chloride. The solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and distilled at atmospheric pressure through a 45-cm. Vigreux column, affording 60\u201376.7 g. (30\u201338%) of O-ethyl thioformate as a yellow liquid, b.p. 87\u201389\u00b0 (Note 9) and (Note 10).",
            "D. Ethyl thiazole-4-carboxylate. A 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 0.25 g. (0.0051 mole) of sodium cyanide and 10 ml. of absolute ethanol. The suspension is stirred vigorously at room temperature as a solution of 4.52 g. (0.0439 mole) of ethyl isocyanoacetate and 3.60 g. (0.0400 mole) of O-ethyl thioformate in 15 ml. of absolute ethanol is added slowly. Because the reaction is exothermic the temperature of the mixture should be kept below 45\u00b0 by adjusting the addition rate and, if necessary, cooling the flask in an ice bath (Note 11). When the addition is completed, the contents of the flask are stirred and heated at 50\u00b0 for another 30 minutes. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the resulting dark oil is extracted with three 60-ml. portions of hot hexane (Note 12). The combined hexane extracts are concentrated with a rotary evaporator until the product begins to separate, and the concentrate is cooled in an ice bath, yielding 5.1\u20135.5 g. (81\u201387%) of ethyl thiazole-4-carboxylate as off-white needles, m.p. 52\u201353\u00b0 (Note 13)."

            "A. N-(Hydroxymethyl)acetamide. In a 2-l., round-bottomed flask, 100 g. (1.70 moles) of acetamide (Note 1) is added to a solution of 10 g. (0.072 mole) of anhydrous potassium carbonate in 137 g. (1.7 moles) of an aqueous 36\u201338% solution of formaldehyde (Note 2). The mixture is swirled, heated on a steam bath for 3 minutes, and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. Several pieces of crushed dry ice are added (Note 3), after which the mixture is evaporated under reduced pressure with a heating bath kept below 40\u00b0 (Note 4). A 128-g. portion of anhydrous sodium sulfate is added to the remaining colorless oil, which may have some precipitated salt suspended in it. After several hours the oil is dissolved in 1 l. of acetone, the suspended drying agent and salts are filtered, and the filtrate (Note 5) is dried further with additional anhydrous sodium sulfate. The suspension is filtered, and the clear filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure. The yield of N-(hydroxymethyl)acetamide, a colorless hygroscopic oil at this point, is 148\u2013151 g. (98\u2013100%) (Note 6). The oily product, which may solidify (Note 7) on standing for several days, is used directly in step B.",

(1.30 moles) of L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Note 8), and 350 ml. of water. The resulting solution is swirled and cooled in an ice bath as 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is slowly added (Note 9). The flask is flushed with nitrogen, capped with a nitrogen-filled balloon, and allowed to stand for 1\u20132 days at room temperature. The progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 10). When L-cysteine hydrochloride is no longer detectable, the solution is evaporated under reduced pressure at a bath temperature of ca. 40\u00b0. The remaining solid is suspended in a small amount of absolute ethanol, and the mixture is again carefully evaporated to avoid bumping. This entrainment procedure with absolute ethanol is repeated several times to remove traces of water. The dry solid is dissolved in the minimum amount of methanol (Note 11), and anhydrous diethyl ether is added until the cloud point is reached. The cloudy solution is allowed to stand in a refrigerator at ca. 4\u20135\u00b0 for 1 week, during which the crystalline mass is broken up several times. The white crystalline product is collected, washed with ether, and dried under reduced pressure, yielding 152\u2013190 g.

In the flask are placed 37.8 g. (0.400 mole) of freshly distilled methyl chloroformate (Note 2) and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is illuminated with a 100-W., high-pressure, mercury-vapor lamp (Note 3) placed beside it (Note 4) and (Note 5). The methyl chloroformate is stirred and irradiated as a slow stream of chlorine (Note 6) is passed into the flask through the gas-inlet tube (Note 7).

The chlorine is then passed into the solution more rapidly so as to maintain the temperature at 30\u201335\u00b0 (Note 9). After ca. 6.5\u20137 hours the colorless solution assumes the pale yellow-green color of chlorine, which indicates that the end point of the reaction has been reached (Note 10).

The suspension is stirred and heated under reflux for 4.75 hours (Note 14), after which the starting thioacetal has completely reacted, as judged by TLC (Note 15). Water (2 ml.) is added to the cooled mixture, the insoluble material is removed by filtration through Celite, and the flask is rinsed with several portions of ether. A 40-ml. portion of water is added to the filtrate, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 25-ml. portions of ether. The organic solutions are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Bulb-to-bulb distillation of the residual brown oil (0.782 g.) in a Kugelrohr apparatus (Note 16) with an oven temperature of 85\u201395\u00b0 (0.005 mm.) provides 0.421\u20130.486 g.

            "The electrode assembly (Note 1) is constructed; the platinum electrodes are positioned vertically, parallel, and about 5 mm apart by careful bending of the lower platinum wire connections.\nTo a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask having a central 34/45 standard taper neck and two 24/40 standard taper necks are added 120 g (0.75 mol) of methyl hydrogen hexanedioate (Note 2), 250 mL of methanol, 4.1 g (0.075 mol) of sodium methoxide, 10 mL of pyridine, and a magnetic stirring bar. The electrode assembly is inserted so that the platinum electrodes are immersed in the solution. A thermometer and reflux water condenser are attached. The mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C and stirred until the sodium methoxide dissolves.\nThe mixture is electrolyzed with a constant current of 1.1 A (Note 3) until GLC analysis (Note 4) of the solution shows the absence of the peak due to methyl hydrogen hexanedioate. This requires about 23 hr; electrolysis is continued for an additional 2.5 hr at the same current (Note 5). Throughout the electrolysis the reaction mixture is maintained at 62\u201365\u00b0C by passage of the current. After about 1 hr of electrolysis, when conditions are stabilized, the reaction may be left unattended.\nThe yellow reaction mixture is allowed to cool and then is acidified with 20 mL of glacial acetic acid. The acidified solution is transferred with methanol washing to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and evaporated (70\u201380\u00b0C, 12 mm) to dryness. The solid residue is stirred with 500 mL of diethyl ether for 1 hr. Undissolved solids are removed by filtration and the residue is washed twice with 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and washings are washed with aqueous sodium carbonate until neutral and then three times with 200-mL portions of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate. Filtration and evaporation of the ether afford a yellow oil that is distilled under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column (30 \u00d7 2.5 cm). This gives 6\u20137 g of dimethyl hexanedioate (bp 69\u201371\u00b0C, 0.02 mm), 3\u20134 g of a mixed fraction (bp 72\u2013105\u00b0C, 0.02 mm) (Note 6), and 60\u201361 g (70\u201371%) of dimethyl decanedioate (bp 105\u2013107\u00b0C, 0.02 mm). The dimethyl decanedioate crystallizes on standing at room temperature, mp 26.5\u201327.2\u00b0C (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed \"Morton\" flask (Note 1) equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser are placed 57 mL (0.50 mol) of styrene, 50 mL of chloroform, 2 g of triethylbenzylammonium chloride, 25 mL of methylene chloride, and a solution of 77 g of sodium hydroxide in 77 mL of water (Note 2). The mixture is stirred vigorously.\nThe temperature is allowed to rise to 40\u00b0C and then kept between 40 and 45\u00b0C by cooling with water (Note 3). After about an hour evolution of heat subsides, and the dark reaction mixture is heated to 55\u201360\u00b0C for an additional hour. The products are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel with 250 mL of water and shaken. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with 25 mL of petroleum ether (Note 4). The organic fractions are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated in vacuo, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column. A forerun at about 50\u00b0C (16 mm) consists mainly of styrene. Distillation of the remainder affords 80\u201382 g (86\u201388%) of dichlorophenylcyclopropane, bp 118\u2013120\u00b0C (16 mm) (Note 5).\nB. Atropaldehyde diethyl acetal.

The mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hr. Some bumping may occur. Water (200 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with three 30-mL portions of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, dried as above with magnesium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column. The acetal begins to distill at about 70\u00b0C (0.5 mm), and the product (14\u201315 g) is collected until the temperature reaches about 100\u00b0C. Gas chromatographic analysis of the product shows it to be about 85% pure (yield 58\u201362%) (Note 6).\nC. Atropaldehyde. The acetal (15 g), placed in a 100-mL flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer, is cooled to about 4\u00b0C in an ice bath. A mixture of 15 mL of formic acid and 4 mL of water is similarly cooled and added in one lot with stirring to the acetal. The temperature drops to about \u22124\u00b0C. The homogenous mixture is stirred for 60 sec and then quenched by adding 15 mL of petroleum ether and 25 mL of water. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken. The aqueous phase is extracted with two additional 15-mL portions of petroleum ether, and the combined extracts are dried as above with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo (Note 7). A mixture of 10 mL each of petroleum ether and diethyl ether is added to the crude aldehyde, and the solution is cooled to about \u221250\u00b0C.

A dry nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the system (Note 3) and the solution is cooled to \u221260\u00b0C by means of a dry ice-methanol bath. Then a solution of 120 g (0.75 mol) of bromine and 375 mL of anhydrous pentane is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 2 hr. When the addition is complete, the mixture must be heated to 40\u00b0C for 2 hr (Note 4) and concentrated by removing ca. 550 mL of solvent under reduced pressure (15 mm) at room temperature. To isolate the dione the residue is cooled to \u221260\u00b0C by immersion of the flask in a dry ice\u2013methanol bath. The crystallized product is quickly filtered through a hermetically sealed (Note 3), 250-mL sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3), a dry nitrogen pressure being used to push down solvent. The yellow solid is washed with stirring with eight 25-mL portions of anhydrous pentane cooled to \u221260\u00b0C and sucked as dry as possible on the filter. The pentane used in the washing is concentrated under reduced pressure (15 mm) at room temperature to ca. 15 mL, then the flask is again cooled to \u221260\u00b0C. The crystallized product is washed with four 15-mL portions of anhydrous pentane cooled to \u221260\u00b0C as before. The two batches of crystals are of approximately equal purity.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 250 mL of water, 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 49.5 g (0.65 mol) of cyclopropylcarbinol (Note 1); the reaction mixture is refluxed for ca. 100 min. The formation of cyclobutanol can be observed nearly instantaneously, as this alcohol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates (Note 2). The flask is then immersed in an ice bath equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel (using a three-way adapter, parallel sidearm), and the reflux condenser is replaced by an ethanol\u2013dry ice trap connected to a U-tube immersed in an ethanol\u2013dry ice bath to ensure condensation of the very volatile cyclobutanone. The flask is charged with an additional 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 mL of water and 440 g (3.5 mol) of oxalic acid dihydrate (Note 1). The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for ca. 15 min to saturate the solution with oxalic acid. A solution of 162 g (1.62 mol) of chromium trioxide in 250 mL of water is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 10\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C (NaCl\u2013ice bath, \u22125\u00b0C to \u221210\u00b0C) and the generation of carbon dioxide remains gentle. The reduction of each drop of chromic acid is practically instantaneous. As the addition of the reagent proceeds (1.5\u20132 hr), oxalic acid gradually dissolves and a dark-blue solution containing chromium(III) salts results (Note 3). Just before the end of the oxidation (ca. 10 mL of the chromic acid solution left), the cyclobutanone (with traces of cyclobutanol) trapped in the U-tube (a few milliliters) is added to the reaction mixture. After the oxidation is completed, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for ca. 1 hr to bring the reaction mixture to room temperature and to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution.\nThe reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with four 200-mL portions of methylene chloride (Note 4). The extracts (the lower phase) are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate containing a small amount of anhydrous potassium carbonate (to remove traces of hydrochloric acid), and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated by distillation through a vacuum-insulated silvered column (20-cm length, 1-cm i.d.) packed with glass helices (size 2.3 mm, Lab Glass, Inc.) and equipped with an adjustable stillhead, until the pot temperature rises to 80\u00b0C (Note 5). The crude product is then transferred to a 100-mL flask and distilled through the same column (reflux ratio 10:1) to give 14\u201316 g (0.20\u20130.23 mol), 31\u201335% overall yield (based on pure cyclopropyl carbinol) of cyclobutanone, bp 98\u201399\u00b0C, d254 0.926, n25D 1.4190 (Note 6). The product is sufficiently pure (98\u201399%) for most purposes (Note 5), (Note 7), (Note 8), and (Note 9)."

            "A. 1,2-Cyclobutanediol. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 200-mL dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 6.2 g (0.16 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (Note 1) and (Note 2) and 200 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 3). The dropping funnel is charged with 42 g (0.48 mol) of 2-hydroxycyclobutanone (Note 4) and 150 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. While the suspension of lithium aluminum hydride is gently stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere, the solution of 2-hydroxycyclobutanone is added dropwise at a rate maintaining a gentle reflux. When the addition is complete, the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr. After the mixture has returned to room temperature, 200 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added. The gray reaction mixture is hydrolyzed by addition, in small parts, of a sufficient amount of wet sodium sulfate (Note 5). The reaction mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3). The organic layer is decanted and dried over sodium sulfate. The solid is extracted with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 6) by means of a Soxhlet apparatus over a period of 24 hr. The combined organic layers are concentrated by distillation of the solvent with a rotary evaporator. The yield of crude cis- and trans-1,2-cyclobutanediol (ca. 50:50) is 34\u201340 g (80\u201395%) (Note 7).\nB. Cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde. A 50-mL distilling flask equipped with a receiver cooled to \u221220\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013methanol bath is charged with 34 g (0.39 mol) of a crude mixture of both cis- and trans-1,2-cyclobutanediol and 10 \u03bcL of boron trifluoride butyl etherate (Note 8). The mixture is heated to 230\u00b0C with a metal bath. Drops of liquid appear on the condenser, and the aldehyde and water distill into the receiver. The temperature of the distillate oscillates between 50 and 100\u00b0C. Each time the distillation stops, 5\u201310 \u03bcL of boron trifluoride butyl etherate is added to the distilling flask (Note 9). The distillate is transferred into a separatory funnel and sodium chloride is added. The organic layer is decanted and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with 25-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic solution is dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 15-cm, helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The residue consists of practically pure cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde, 17.5\u201321.6 g (65\u201380%) (Note 10)."

Manipulations with this reagent should be performed with great care.\nA dry, 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen (admitted through a hypodermic needle in the septum). A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. The flask is charged with 420 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 1), and the solvent is cooled to \u221262\u00b0C in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath. Tungsten hexachloride (60g, 0.15 mol) (Note 2) is then introduced. While the cold suspension is stirred, 31 mL (0.30 mol) of 90% butyllithium in hexane (Note 3) is added slowly from a hypodermic syringe. The rate of addition (complete in ca. 5 min) is such that the temperature remains below \u221215\u00b0C. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. The green-brown viscous suspension becomes a dark-brown homogeneous solution that eventually turns green at room temperature. Because the reaction with the epoxide is exothermic, the flask is momentarily returned to the acetone\u2013dry ice bath while 14.8 g (0.081 mol) of trans-cyclododecene oxide (Note 4) and (Note 5) is introduced with a hypodermic syringe. The cooling bath is again removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature. After 30 min (Note 6) the mixture is poured into 600 mL of an aqueous solution that is 1.5 M in sodium tartrate and 2 M in sodium hydroxide (Note 7), and extracted with 240 mL of hexane. The organic phase is washed with a mixture of 160 mL of water and 80 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator.

The reaction described in Step A should be conducted in a hood, since some carbon monoxide is generated by partial decarbonylation of pivaloyl chloride.\nA. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate (1). The center neck of a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer port, magnetic stirrer bar coated with Teflon, and heating mantle is fitted with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The two side necks are fitted with 7 cm (diam) \u00d7 27 cm dry ice condensers vented through oil-filled bubblers into traps containing aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide (Note 1). A thermometer is placed in the thermometer port to extend nearly to the bottom of the flask without contacting the stirrer bar. The apparatus is purged with dry nitrogen, the nitrogen flow is stopped, and to the flask are added 300 g (2.5 mol) of pivaloyl chloride and 46 g (0.62 mol) of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol (Note 2). The condensers are charged with isopropyl alcohol-dry ice and, with stirring, the reaction mixture is warmed to 85\u00b0C. Heating is discontinued, and the mantle is allowed to remain in place. Then 187.5 g (109 mL, 1.25 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is added with stirring during a period of 2\u20133 min (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the temperature is maintained at 95\u2013105\u00b0C for 10 min with the heating mantle. The mantle is removed, and the brown reaction mixture is first allowed to spontaneously cool to 50\u00b0C and finally cooled to \u221210\u00b0C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry-ice bath. On addition of 1 L of cold diethyl ether (Note 4), a precipitate forms immediately and is collected, washed with three 300-mL portions of diethyl ether, and air-dried on a medium-porosity fritted-glass filter to give 118\u2013137 g (53\u201362%) of light tan 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate, mp 153\u2013164\u00b0C (Note 5).\nB. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (2). To 119\u2013128 g (0.33\u20130.36 mol) of crude pyrylium salt in a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer is added 2 L of 95% ethanol. The mixture is cooled to \u221260\u00b0C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath and to the fine slurry is added, with stirring, in one portion 1 L of concentrated (d 0.90) ammonium hydroxide also cooled to \u221260\u00b0C. The yellow reaction mixture is held at \u221260\u00b0C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to \u221240\u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 2 hr, during which time the slurry dissolves. The mixture is then allowed to spontaneously warm to room temperature (Note 6). The reaction mixture is divided into two portions. Each portion is poured into a 4-L separatory funnel, 1 L of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is extracted with four 250-mL portions of pentane (Note 7). The extracts from both portions are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 8), leaving a residual light-yellow oil that is dissolved in 150 mL of pentane and introduced slowly during 20\u201330 min onto the top of a 40 \u00d7 4.5 cm water-jacketed chromatography column (Note 9) containing 300 g of activated alumina (Note 10). After the solution has been added, the column is filled with pentane and a 1-L constant-pressure addition funnel, also filled with pentane, is fitted to the top of the column to provide a slight head pressure. The elution is completed in ca. 90 min. All the pyridine is obtained in the first 2 L of eluant (Note 11). The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator to yield 62.7\u201366.3 g (90\u201393%) of a colorless, odorless oil that solidifies on cooling or standing, mp 31\u201332\u00b0C (Note 12)."

            "A. 1,2,4,5-Hexatetraene in ether solution. A 2-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite), a dropping funnel, and a thermometer (Note 1). The flask is charged with 0.5 g (0.002 mol) of mercury(II) chloride and 29.2 g (1.2 mol) of magnesium turnings that have been crushed with a mortar and pestle, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen while being heated externally with a Bunsen burner to remove traces of moisture. In the cooled flask are placed 160 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether (Note 2) and 7.6 g (5.0 mL, 0.064 mol) of propargyl bromide (Note 3). The ether begins to reflux within 1 min, indicating that formation of the Grignard reagent has begun (Note 4). The mixture is cooled to 5\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as a solution of 135 g (89 mL, 1.13 mol) of propargyl bromide in 560 mL of anhydrous ether is added. The addition rate is adjusted so as to maintain the internal temperature between 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C (Note 5). The cooling bath is removed, and the dark green mixture is stirred for 45 min at room temperature (Note 6). A 2-g (0.02 mol) portion of finely pulverized, dry copper(I) chloride (Note 7) is added, and the mixture, which becomes a chocolate-brown color after 2\u20133 min, is stirred for 15 min at room temperature and cooled again to 5\u00b0C with either an ice-water bath or an ice-salt bath. Stirring is continued while a solution of 128 g (85 mL, 1.08 mol) of propargyl bromide in 100 mL of ether is added at a rate such that the internal temperature is kept at ca. 20\u00b0C (Note 8). The mixture becomes almost black, and two phases are discernible when the stirrer is stopped, especially toward the end of the addition. The cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 15 min at room temperature to complete the dimerization. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as 200 mL of 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid is added (Note 9). The two-phase mixture is warmed to room temperature, and another 100 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid is added. The ether layer is separated and washed with three 100-mL portions of water (Note 10). A few crystals (0.2\u20130.5 g) of hydroquinone are added to stabilize the reddish solution, which is then dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate. The drying agent is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to a volume of ca. 400 mL by distillation under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure with a 40-cm Vigreux column and a heating bath kept at 40\u201345\u00b0C. The concentrate is purified by vacuum transfer (Note 11), and the now colorless solution, which contains ca. 25\u201330 g (30\u201336%) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene, is stabilized by adding another 0.1\u20130.5 g of hydroquinone (Note 12) and (Note 13).\nB. Tetramethyl[2.2]paracyclophane-4,5,12,13-tetracarboxylate. The 1-L flask from Step A containing ca. 25\u201330 g (0.32\u20130.38 mol) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene in ether solution is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 40-cm Vigreux column for distillation at atmospheric pressure. A solution of 69.4 g (60 mL, 0.49 mol) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (Note 14) in 220 mL of benzene (Note 15) is added. The resulting solution is stirred and heated at 45\u00b0C for 5\u20137 hr and at 70\u00b0C for 20 hr (Note 16). The ether distils slowly at 45\u00b0C and rather rapidly at 70\u00b0C, the color of the solution changes from yellow to red\u2013orange, and a white solid is gradually deposited. The mixture is cooled and filtered. Recrystallization of the solid from 600\u2013800 mL of toluene affords 27\u201335 g of white crystalline product, mp 201.5\u2013203\u00b0C. The original benzene filtrate and the toluene mother liquor, when evaporated to dryness and crystallized separately from 40\u201370 mL of toluene, provide 3\u20134 g and 2\u20133 g of product, respectively, having essentially the same melting point. The combined yield is 33\u201341 g (40\u201350% based on 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene) (Note 17) and (Note 18)."

            "Caution! Phenylchlorodiazirine is highly explosive (Note 6). It should always be handled with adequate shielding and normal protective equipment such as face shield and leather gloves.\nBenzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a high-speed mechanical stirrer and a 250-mL pressure-equalized dropping funnel is charged with 22.5 g (0.143 mol) of benzamidine hydrochloride (Note 1), 37.5 g (0.62 mol) of sodium chloride, 300 mL of hexane, and 400 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. The flask is cooled at 0\u00b0C in an ice\u2013salt bath (Note 2), and a mixture containing 15.5 g (2.65 mol) of sodium chloride in 1.2 L of aqueous 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (Note 3) is added with vigorous stirring over a 15-min period using the dropping funnel. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 15 min. At this time the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 75-mL portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are combined with the organic phase and the mixture is washed successively four times with 125-mL portions of water and once with a 125-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The mixture is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a volume of approximately 75 mL at 25\u00b0C under aspirator vacuum. The mixture is filtered through a 3-cm \u00d7 14-cm column of silica gel (Note 4) and eluted with 200 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 5) into a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask. Concentration under reduced pressure at room temperature to a volume of approximately 50 mL yields a yellow solution (Note 6). The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, heating mantle, and reflux condenser protected from the atmosphere by a calcium chloride drying tube and then charged with 600 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 5) and 7.49 g (0.0634 mol) of trans-\u03b2-methylstyrene.\nThe reaction mixture is then heated at reflux for 3.5 hr and allowed to cool to 25\u00b0C. The benzene is removed at 25\u00b0C on a rotary evaporator to afford a dark-brown oil. This was diluted with 50 mL of ether, filtered through a 3-cm \u00d7 14-cm column of silica gel (Note 4), and eluted with an additional 175 mL of ether. Removal of the ether under reduced pressure yields ca. 21 g of an oily orange solid that consists of a mixture of diastereomeric 1-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropanes (Note 7).\nThe crude mixture is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a calcium chloride drying tube. To the flask is added 450 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 8), and the mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. The drying tube is removed for a brief period, and 28.5 g (0.25 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 9) is quickly added in one portion using a powder funnel. The reaction is stirred for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, warmed to 0\u00b0C, stirred for 3 hr, and then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr. At the end of this time 60 mL of water is added slowly to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 25\u00b0C to a volume of ca. 150 mL. The mixture is taken up in 160 mL of ether and washed successively with six 60-mL portions of water and one 60-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The resulting dark-brown oil is chromatographed through a 4-cm \u00d7 41-cm column of silica gel (Note 10) with eluting with hexane. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure at 25\u00b0C affords 10.5\u201311.5 g (80\u201388%) of 1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropene as a pale yellow oil (Note 11)."

The two platinum anodes of the electrode assembly (Note 1) are positioned in a horizontal plane ca. 1 cm above (Note 4) the mercury (cathode) surface.\nTo the cell are added diethyl fumarate (172 g, 1.0 mol) (Note 5), absolute ethanol (200 mL), and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (3.41 g, 0.1 mol) (Note 6). The mixture is allowed to stand for 0.5 hr to allow complete dissolution of the tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The cell is placed in a flowing-water bath in a hood.\nThe solution is electrolyzed with continuous magnetic stirring and nitrogen purging at a constant current (Note 7) until the theoretical quantity of electricity (1.0F \u2261 1e\u2212 per mole of diethyl fumarate) has been passed. The rate at which the cooling water in the bath flows is adjusted to maintain the electrolyte solution at 35\u00b0C during the first 2 hr of the electrolysis. It is then kept constant for the remainder of the electrolysis. After conditions have stabilized (ca. 1\u20132 hr of electrolysis), the reaction does not need constant attention, and may be allowed to run overnight.\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask with ethanol washing and the ethanol is removed by rotatory evaporation. Diethyl ether (1 L) is added to precipitate the electrolyte salt, which is collected by filtration and washed with ether. The crude electrolyte is obtained as a white solid (32\u201332.5 g, theory 34.1 g).

The catalyst is removed by vacuum filtration through Hyflow, the filtercake is rinsed with three portions of 95% ethyl alcohol (Note 9), and the filtrate is stripped to leave solid, impure product. This is triturated with 200 mL of ice-cold acetone; filtration and rinsing of the solids with fresh acetone and ultimately with ether yield 33.2\u201335.8 g (87\u201394%) of air-dried material, mp 225\u2013226\u00b0C (Note 10).

Imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde.3 A solution of 19.1 g (0.05 mol) of dry, unrecrystallized 2-(1,3-dibenzoylimidazolidin-2-yl) imidazole hydrochloride in 200 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid is refluxed for 22 hr (Note 11). The mixture is then chilled on ice, causing deposition of benzoic acid, which is removed by filtration (Note 11). The filtrate, on evaporation, leaves a residue that is first digested with 100 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol and then cooled on ice. The remaining solids are essentially pure ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and are filtered off (Note 12). Filtrate solvent is again removed under reduced pressure to leave solid residue. This is dissolved in 40 mL of water. Addition of solid sodium bicarbonate until foaming ceases causes imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde to crystallize. The mixture is chilled on ice, and the product is filtered and washed with ice-water to give, after thorough drying, 3.2\u20133.7 g (67\u201377%) of beige crystals, mp 206\u2013207\u00b0C.

Tetrahydropyranyl derivative of propargyl alcohol [tetrahydro-2-(2-propynyloxy)-2H-pyran]. Two crystals (ca. 10 mg) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added to 268 g (291.3 mL, 3.2 mol) of warm (60\u00b0C) dihydropyran (Note 2) in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a dropping funnel containing 168 g (174.5 mL, 3.0 mol) of propargyl alcohol (Note 2) and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube. Stirring is started, and the propargyl alcohol is added (Note 3) as a thin stream during a period of ca. 30 min. The reaction is mildly exothermic, and the temperature is maintained at 60\u201365\u00b0C by controlling the rate of addition of the propargyl alcohol and by occasional external cooling with an ice bath. After the addition is completed, the temperature is monitored for another 30 min; slight cooling is sometimes necessary to keep the temperature in the range of 60\u201365\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred for a total of 1.5 hr after the addition is completed, and then 0.5 g of powdered sodium bicarbonate is added and the mixture stirred for another hour. The mixture is then gravity-filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. The reaction mixture is distilled through a 45-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure (Note 15). A small forerun (ca. 40 mL) with a bp of 45\u00b0C (15\u201320 mm) is followed by the product, bp 47\u201350\u00b0C (3.5\u20135 mm), 330\u2013355 g (78\u201392%) (Note 15); n22D 1.4559 (Note 16); 1H NMR (90 MHz, neat) \u03b4: 1.18\u20131.93 (br m, 6, H2',2'', H3',3'', H4',4''); 2.47 (t, 1, J = 2, C\u2261C-H), 3.17\u20133.84 (m, 2, H5',5''), 4.03 (d, 2, J = 2, C\u2261C-CH2O), 4.63 (s, 1, H1); IR (neat) cm\u22121: 3300 (C\u2261C-H), 2117 (C\u2261C stretch).\nB. Methyl 4-hydroxy-2-butynoate. One mole of ethylmagnesium bromide (Note 4) in diethyl ether is poured into a dry (Note 5) 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a glass stirrer bearing (Note 6), a dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube, and an efficient condenser fitted with a drying tube. Stirring is started, and a solution of 140 g (1.0 mol, 141 mL) of the tetrahydropyranyl derivative of propargyl alcohol in 1-L of dry (Note 7) tetrahydrofuran is added during ca. 30 min (Note 8). Stirring is continued for an additional 1.5 hr, during which time a dry 3-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, immersion thermometer, and dropping funnel. The 3-L flask is charged with a solution of 104 g (1.10 mol, 85.4 mL) of methyl chloroformate (Note 2) in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the contents stirred and cooled to \u221220\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Under gentle nitrogen pressure the acetylenic Grignard reagent is transferred portionwise through a \u00bc-in. polypropylene tube to the dropping funnel attached to the 3-L, three-necked flask (Note 9). The acetylenic Grignard reagent is then added dropwise during 1.5 hr to the well-stirred solution of methyl chloroformate in tetrahydrofuran while the temperature is maintained at \u221215 to \u221220\u00b0C by external cooling. After the addition is completed, the light-brown reaction mixture is stirred another 30 min at \u221215\u00b0C, followed by another 1.5 hr at ice temperature. The reaction mixture is then stored without stirring for 12 hr at +3\u00b0C, during which time the remaining magnesium salts separate from solution. The salts are removed by filtration (Note 10) and washed with three 150-mL portions of cold (0\u00b0C), dry toluene. The supernatant and washings are combined and concentrated (Note 11) to ca. 500-mL volume. The dark-brown solution is then washed five times with 100-mL portions of saturated brine followed by drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is concentrated to remove the toluene and then dissolved (Note 12) in 1 L of anhydrous methanol; 25 mL of Dowex 50-X4 cation resin (H+ form, prewashed with anhydrous methanol) is then added and the mixture stirred for 1.5 hr at 25\u00b0C. The ion-exchange resin is removed by filtration through a sintered-glass filter and is then washed with two 50-mL portions of anhydrous methanol. Solvent and 2-methoxytetrahydropyran are removed by concentration using a water aspirator and then an oil pump at 0.5-mm pressure. The residue from the concentration is then treated a second time (Note 13) with 1 L of anhydrous methanol and 25 mL of Dowex 50, followed by concentration as before. The residue is then distilled through a Claisen head to give methyl 4-hydroxy-2-butynoate (Note 14), 69\u201374 g (60\u201365%), by 66\u201369\u00b0C/0.2 mm, n22D 1.4684 (Note 17); 1H NMR [(CD3)2SO] \u03b4: 3.79 (s, 3, OCH3), 4.31 (d, 2, CH2, J = 6), 5.57 (t, 1, OH); IR (neat) cm\u22121: 3410 (OH), 2240 (-C\u2261C-), 1715 (ester)."

A solution of 7.30 g (0.05 mol) of \u03b1-tetralone (Note 3) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 4) is added at room temperature. The N-methylanilinium trifluoroacetate dissolves, and the magnetically stirred mixture is refluxed for 4 hr under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 5). During this time a red color develops and the paraformaldehyde dissolves after 2 hr. After 4 hr the heating oil bath is removed and the red solution allowed to cool for 10 min. Diethyl ether (100 mL) is gradually added under efficient magnetic stirring, which induces the separation of a red gum. The ethereal solution is decanted from the red gum into a separatory funnel and washed with 50 mL of half-saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The red gum is triturated with 50 mL of diethyl ether, and the resulting ethereal solution is then used to extract the washing water (Note 6). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and concentration of the extract, first on a rotary evaporator then under high vacuum, afford 8.05\u20138.6 g of a heavy red oil (Note 7). Trituration of this oil with 70 mL of diethyl ether precipitates impurities and causes some polymerization. Filtration through Celite and concentration under high vacuum give 6.8\u20137.2 g (86\u201391%) of material that solidifies in a freezer (Note 8).

The suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 12.0 g (0.070 mol) of benzyl bromide (Note 5) is added over ca. 5 min. The ice bath is removed, and the mixture is allowed to stir for 18 hr at room temperature (Note 6). The suspension is filtered through Celite, the filter cake is washed with two 50-mL portions of toluene, and the combined filtrates are evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining liquid, which weighs 9.6\u201310.4 g, is dissolved in 15 mL of 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane. The cloudy solution is applied to a 5-cm \u00d7 47.5-cm column prepared with 380\u2013385 g of silica gel (Note 7) packed in 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane. The column is eluted with 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane, and 250-mL fractions are collected and analyzed by TLC (Note 8). A total of 12 or 13 fractions (3\u20133.25 L) is collected first to separate benzyl bromide, dibenzyl ether, and other minor by-products. The product is then eluted with 0.5\u20131.0 L of tetrahydrofuran, the solvent is evaporated, and the remaining 6.0\u20136.5 g of liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. After separation of a 0.7\u20131.0 g forerun, bp 30\u201368\u00b0C (0.2 mm), consisting mainly of benzyl alcohol, 3.87\u20134.33 g (43\u201349%) of 4-benzyloxy-2-butanone, bp 77\u201379\u00b0C (0.2 mm), nD25 1.5018 is collected (Note 9).",
            "B. 5-Benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic-2-13C acid. A 50-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a condenser connected to a nitrogen inlet, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The apparatus is purged with nitrogen and dried (Note 1), and the flask is charged with 1.79 g (2.4 mL, 0.0177 mol) of freshly distilled diisopropylamine and 6.5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 10). The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 7.22 mL (0.0169 mol) of 2.34 M butyllithium in hexane (Note 11) is added from the dropping funnel over 30 min. After 30 min a solution of 0.439 g (0.00720 mol) of acetic acid-2-13C (Note 12) in 3 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added by syringe over ca. 10 min. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath for 3.5 hr, after which 1.30 g (0.0073 mol) of 4-benzyloxy-2-butanone in 4 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added by syringe over 15 min. Stirring is continued for 2 hr at 0\u00b0C and 18 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, hydrolyzed by adding 4.5 mL of water, and concentrated under reduced pressure to remove most of the tetrahydrofuran. The remaining aqueous suspension is basified by addition of 6 mL of aqueous 4% sodium hydroxide and extracted with 30 mL of diethyl ether. The ethereal layer is extracted with 40 mL of 4% sodium hydroxide, the combined alkaline extracts are cooled and acidified to pH 3 with ca. 10 mL of 18% hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous mixture is extracted with three 25-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated. The remaining viscous, yellow liquid weighs 0.95\u20131.01 g (55\u201359%) and is used in part C without further purification (Note 13).",
            "C. Mevalonolactone-2-13C. In a 250-mL Parr hydrogenation bottle are placed 50 mL of 95% ethanol, 0.107 g (0.001 mol) of palladium black (Note 14), and 0.519 g (0.00217 mol) of 5-benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid-2-13C. The bottle is attached to a Parr hydrogenation apparatus (Note 15), charged to 50 psig with hydrogen and shaken at room temperature for 2 hr. The hydrogen is flushed from the bottle with nitrogen, and the suspension is filtered by gravity through a layer of Celite with a medium-porosity sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel to separate the catalyst. The palladium is pyrophoric and must always be kept wet with ethanol during filtration to prevent contact with air (Note 16). The bed of Celite and adhering catalyst is rinsed with three 5-mL portions of ethanol. The combined filtrates are returned to the Parr bottle, 0.107 g (0.001 mol) of fresh palladium black is added, and the hydrogenation is continued for another 8 hr. The catalyst is separated by filtration as previously described, and the combined filtrates are evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residual liquid with a Kugelrohr apparatus at 90\u2013100\u00b0C and 0.01 mm affords 0.235\u20130.249 g (83\u201388%) of mevalonolactone-2-13C as a slightly yellow oil (Note 17)."

            "Caution! This procedure should be carried out in a hood since 2-nitropropene is a powerful lachrymator. Nitroolefins have a tendency to undergo \"fume-offs\" (which can be like explosions) near the end of a distillation, particularly if air is let in on a hot distillation residue (from a vacuum distillation).\nA 250 mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 96.5 g (0.65 mol) of phthalic anhydride (Note 1) and 52.5 g (0.50 mol) of 2-nitro-1-propanol (Note 2). A 10-cm vacuum-insulated Vigreux column, a stillhead fitted with a thermometer, a condenser, a 50-mL, round-bottomed receiving flask, and a water aspirator are installed in due order, and the reaction vessel is placed in an oil bath and evacuated to 110 mm (Note 3). The bath temperature is raised to 150\u00b0C and maintained for 30 min while the phthalic anhydride melts to give a homogeneous solution. The receiving flask is immersed in an ice bath, stirring is started, and the bath temperature is raised to 180\u00b0C. As the reaction mixture darkens, green-colored 2-nitropropene is gradually distilled off with water, bp 50\u201365\u00b0C (110 mm). The bath temperature is held at 180\u2013185\u00b0C until the distillation ceases (ca. 1 hr). The distillate is transferred into a 50-mL separatory funnel, and the lower layer is separated from water (Note 4) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Redistillation under reduced pressure through a 10-cm vacuum-insulated Vigreux column (Note 5) gives 25.0\u201331.4 g (57\u201372%) of 2-nitropropene, which is collected in an ice-cooled receiving flask as a transparent green liquid, bp 56\u201357\u00b0C (86 mm), nD20 1.4348 [lit.2 bp 58\u00b0C (90 mm), nD19 1.4292, d201.0492] (Note 5).

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 125 mL of chloroform and 13 g (0.2 mol) of sodium azide. The mixture is cooled with an ice\u2013salt bath to \u22125\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C, and 37.5 mL (0.5 mol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added, followed after 5\u201310 min with 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of 2-phenyl-2-adamantanol (Note 1). The resulting slurry is stirred for 4 hr at 0\u00b0C and then allowed to reach room temperature overnight. The mixture is cautiously neutralized with a slight excess of 12\u201315% aqueous ammonia solution and transferred to a separatory funnel. The chloroform layer is separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted with 50 mL of chloroform. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of water, separated, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed in a rotary evaporator. The oily residue solidifies on cooling. The yield is 23.6\u201324.8 g (93\u201398%), mp 42\u201345\u00b0C. Recrystallization of a sample from 2-propanol raises the melting point to 47\u201348\u00b0C (Note 2).\nB. 2-Phenyl-2-adamantanamine hydrochloride. A solution of 24 g (0.095 mol) of the crude 2-azido-2-phenyladamantane in 75 mL of 2-propanol is placed in a 1-L beaker fitted with a mechanical stirrer, and heated in a water bath that can be removed quickly. Wet, active Raney nickel (Note 3) and (Note 4) is added in portions at 60\u201370\u00b0C with stirring until the evolution of nitrogen ceases (Note 5). The mixture is heated for an additional 10 min, filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel, and washed with 75 mL of 2-propanol in such a manner that the catalyst is always covered with liquid (Note 6). The filtrate is concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The crude residue is dissolved in 75 mL of toluene and treated with 22 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid while stirring. The 2-phenyl-2-adamantanamine hydrochloride is collected, triturated with 50 mL of warm acetone, filtered again, and air-dried. The yield is 22.5\u201324.0 g (90\u201396%), and the product melts at 293\u2013296\u00b0C (closed capillary) (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

Boron trifluoride gas is highly corrosive; this preparation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood.\nA dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a gas-inlet tube (Note 1), a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a Dewar condenser cooled with ice-water and fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite). A solution of 20.9 g (0.180 mol) of triethylsilane (Note 2) in 80 mL of dichloromethane (Note 3) is placed in the flask. The solution is stirred rapidly and cooled in an ice bath while boron trifluoride gas (Note 4) is introduced below the surface of the liquid at a moderate rate. The first appearance of white fumes at the exit of the drying tube (Note 5) indicates that the solution is saturated and the apparatus is filled with boron trifluoride. The flow of boron trifluoride is adjusted to a level sufficient to maintain a slight emission of white fumes from the drying tube, and a solution of 10.0 g (0.0606 mol) of m-nitroacetophenone (Note 6) in 30 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise during 10 min. Stirring and cooling are continued for 30 min, after which the flow of boron trifluoride gas is stopped and the cooling bath is removed. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min, cooled again with the ice bath, and hydrolyzed by adding 20 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride. The upper organic layer is decanted from the salts, which are then dissolved in 50 mL of water.

            "A 2-L, three-necked flask is thoroughly flamed while being flushed with argon and is then fitted with three rubber septa. Anhydrous titanium trichloride (63.16 g, 0.409 mol) (Note 1) and (Note 2) is added to the weighed flask in an argon-filled glove bag. The flask is reweighed, and one of the rubber septa is replaced with a dry (12 hr at 120\u00b0C) reflux condenser through which a stream of argon is flowing (Note 3). The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer equipped with a glass shaft and Teflon paddle (Note 4). Into the flask is syringed 600 mL of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 5), and the remaining rubber septum is exchanged for a glass stopper. Lithium (8.52 g, 1.23 mol) (Note 6) is etched to brilliance in methanol, quickly washed in petroleum ether (Note 7), and cut into small pieces directly into the stirred suspension. The mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr by an oil bath that is then removed (Note 8). Immediately after the solvent has ceased to reflux, 2-adamantanone (15.36 g, 0.102 mol) (Note 1) is added in one portion, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 18 hr.\nStirring is maintained as the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and 600 mL of petroleum ether (Note 7) is added in 100-mL portions at 5-min intervals (Note 9). The stirrer is disconnected from its motor, and the solution is poured into a sintered-glass funnel containing 50 g of Florisil (approximately 7 cm in depth) (Note 1). The black material remaining in the reaction vessel is washed with eight 50-mL portions of petroleum ether, which are poured into the same pad of Florisil (Note 10) and (Note 11). The filter pad is then washed with 400 mL of petroleum ether. Removal of the solvent from the combined filtrates by means of a rotary evaporator followed by high vacuum (0.05 mm) gives 12\u201313 g of a white crystalline solid. This crude product is dissolved in 3.5 L of hot methanol (Note 1), and the volume is reduced to 2 L by boiling. The solution is allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. The colorless needles are vacuum filtered through sintered glass (medium frit) and washed with 50 mL of ice-cold methanol. The crystals are dried under vacuum (0.05 mm Hg) to give 10.3\u201310.4 g (75\u201376%) of adamantylideneadamantane, mp 184\u2013186\u00b0C; 1H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4: 1.5\u20132.1 (br m, 24 H) 2.7\u20133.1 (br m, 4 H). Concentration of the mother liquor to 350 mL and crystallization as described above yields an additional 1.2\u20131.5 g (9-11%) of product, mp 182\u2013184\u00b0C (Note 12)."

            "A 1-L, three necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which is attached an oil bubbler, a rubber septum, and an argon or nitrogen inlet to maintain a static inert gas atmosphere in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. The flask and dropping funnel are charged with 500 mL of dry methylene chloride and 40 mL (34 g, 0.20 mol) of 1-trimethylsiloxy-1-cyclohexene (Note 1), respectively. The flask is flushed with dry inert gas and immersed in a cooling bath at ca. \u221278\u00b0C (acetone or 2-propanol-dry ice). Stirring is started and 23 mL (52.1 g, 0.20 mol) of anhydrous stannic chloride (Note 2) is added rapidly through the rubber septum by means of a syringe. Then 20.0 mL (21.0 g, 0.23 mol) of 2-nitropropene (Note 3) is added through the rubber septum by a syringe over a period of 5\u201310 min, giving a green solution. The reaction mixture is further stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 20 min, and then the silyl enol ether is added dropwise to the mixture over 1 hr, giving a faint yellow solution. After completion of the addition the resulting solution is stirred at ca. \u221278\u00b0C for an additional hour; then the bath temperature is gradually warmed to \u22125\u00b0C over a period of 3\u20133.5 hr while the stirring is continued (Note 4). The inert gas flow is stopped, the dropping funnel is replaced by a condenser, the magnetic stirrer is removed, and the flask is equipped with a heating mantle and an overhead stirring device. Then 280 mL of water are added, and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred at reflux for 2 hr (Note 5). The mixture is subsequently cooled to room temperature and then poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the methylene chloride layer is separated from the water. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 100 mL of methylene chloride, and the combined organic layers are washed twice with 160-mL portions of cold water (Note 6) and once with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residual oil is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure to yield 18.7\u201321.5 g (61\u201370%) of 2-(2-oxopropyl)cyclohexanone as a fragrant yellow liquid, bp 84\u201385\u00b0C (0.8 mm), nD19 1.4671 [lit.2 bp 91\u201393\u00b0C (1.1 mm), nD25 1.4655] (Note 7)."

            "Caution! All operations should be carried out in a hood! m-Trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride is a lachrymator. Spills should be treated with saturated sodium carbonate.\n\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-Trifluoro-m-toluidine (m-aminobenzotrifluoride) (96.7 g, 0.6 mol) (Note 1) is added in one portion to a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid (200 mL) and glacial acetic acid (60 mL) in a 1000-mL beaker arranged for efficient mechanical stirring (Note 2). The white hydrochloride salt precipitates (Note 3). The beaker is placed in a dry ice-ethanol bath and, when the temperature of the stirred mixture has reached \u221210\u00b0C, a solution of sodium nitrite (44.8 g, 0.65 mol) in water (65 mL) is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed \u22125\u00b0C (Note 4). After all the sodium nitrite solution has been added, the mixture is stirred for 45 min while the temperature is maintained between \u221210\u00b0C and \u22125\u00b0C (Note 5).\nWhile the diazotization is being completed, glacial acetic acid (600 mL) is placed in a 4000-mL beaker and stirred magnetically. Sulfur dioxide is introduced by a bubbler tube with a fritted end immersed below the surface of the acetic acid until saturation is evident (Note 6). Cuprous chloride (15 g) (Note 7) is added to the solution. The introduction of sulfur dioxide is continued until the yellow\u2013green suspension becomes blue-green. Most of the solids dissolve during this time (20\u201330 min). The mixture is then placed in an ice bath and cooled with stirring. When the temperature approaches 10\u00b0C, the diazotization reaction mixture (Note 8) is added in portions over a 30-min period to the sulfur dioxide solution. Considerable foaming occurs after each addition, and this can be disrupted with a few drops of ether. The temperature rises during the addition, but it should not exceed 30\u00b0C. After all the diazonium salt mixture has been added, the mixture is poured into ice water (1 : 1, 2000 mL), stirred magnetically until the ice has melted, and added to a 4000-mL separatory funnel. The product separates as a yellow oil that is drawn off. The reaction mixture is extracted with 200-mL portions of ether until the ether washings are colorless (Note 9), and these washings are added to the initial product. The combined organic fraction is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until neutral (Note 10), then with water, and is then dried with magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled (bp 54\u201355\u00b0C, 0.1 mm) through a 10-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give m-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (100\u2013115 g, 68\u201379%) as a colorless or slightly yellow, clear liquid (Note 11), (Note 12)."

The stirred suspension is cooled in an ice bath and 42.6 g of acetone cyanohydrin (45.7 mL, 0.501 mol) (Note 3) is added dropwise over 15 min. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture stirred for 2 hr at room temperature (Note 4). The magnetic stirring bar is removed and the solvent evaporated as completely as possible on a rotary evaporator. The white lithium cyanide is then dried in vacuo for 3 hr (Note 5) and (Note 6). The lithium cyanide is freed from the sides of the flask and broken up with a spatula (Note 7). A 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with an ice bath, magnetic stirrer, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 54.32 g (63.46 ml, 0.500 mol) of trimethylchlorosilane (Note 8) and 100 mL of bis[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl] ether (Note 9). The lithium cyanide is added to this stirred solution over 15 min through Gooch tubing (Note 10). After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the milky suspension stirred overnight at room temperature. The Gooch tubing and the thermometer are then removed from the reaction flask and a stillhead equipped for downward vacuum distillation is attached. A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask immersed halfway in an acetone-dry ice slush bath (Note 11) is employed as the receiver. The volatile compounds are distilled under a pressure of 50 mm (bp 25\u201355\u00b0C) by heating the contents of the pot using an oil bath (Note 12).

A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, West condenser, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with 6.30 g (58.2 mmol) of p-benzoquinone (Note 16), 10 mL of dry carbon tetrachloride, and 8 mL (63.03 mmol) of trimethylsilyl cyanide. The stirred suspension is heated to a gentle reflux by means of a heat gun to dissolve all the p-benzoquinone. It is then allowed to cool slowly until the crystallization of the p-benzoquinone starts (Note 17), at which time 5 mg of the 1 : 1 complex between potassium cyanide and 18-crown-6 (Note 18) is added through the top of the condenser. An immediate vigorous reflux sets in and continues for 1\u20132 min (Note 19). The stirred reaction mixture is permitted to cool slowly to room temperature, whereupon the condenser is removed and 3 g of Florisil (Note 20) is added. After stirring for an additional 15 min, 10 mL of dry carbon tetrachloride is added. The suspension is then filtered and the filtercake leached with three 5-mL portions of carbon tetrachloride. The solvent is evaporated from the filtrate as completely as possible on a rotary evaporator, at which point crystallization of the residue usually begins (Note 21). The last traces of solvent and trimethylsilyl cyanide are then removed in vacuo over 20 hr at 50 \u03bc to afford 12.0\u201312.2 g of crude product. The trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin is recrystallized by dissolving the crude material in 25 mL of hot hexane and allowing the resulting solution to cool slowly to room temperature (Note 22).

In a nitrogen-flushed, 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar are placed 11.0 g (0.45 mol) of magnesium turnings and 50 mL of diethyl ether (Note 2). To this flask is added 10% of 78.5 g (0.5 mol) of bromobenzene in one portion (Note 3). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux without stirring to start Grignard reagent formation. When the reaction has started (Note 4), the rest of the bromobenzene in 100 mL of diethyl ether is added with stirring at such a rate that gentle reflux is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for an additional 1 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and diethyl ether is added to give a total volume of about 300 mL (Note 5). The reflux condenser and the dropping funnel are replaced by a nitrogen inlet tube and a pierced rubber septum with Teflon tube inlet (Note 6).\nIn a second nitrogen-flushed, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a two-way adapter carrying a calcium chloride tube and a rubber septum with a Teflon tube, connected to a reaction flask (1 in Fig. 1), are placed 4.4 g (31 mmol) of copper(I) bromide (Note 7) and 70 mL of diethyl ether. The ethereal Grignard solution from the reaction flask (1) is added, through the Teflon tube by means of nitrogen pressure (see Fig. 1), to this vigorously stirred suspension at \u221220\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at \u221220\u00b0C for \u00bd hr. The rubber septum is replaced by a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 40.0 g (0.26 mol) of (R)-(+)-pulegone (Note 8) in 50 mL of diethyl ether. This solution is added with stirring at \u221220\u00b0C to the dark-green reaction mixture during ca. 2 hr. After the reaction mixture is kept overnight at \u221220\u00b0C, it is added to 300 mL of vigorously stirred ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated and filtered with suction, and the residue on the funnel is washed twice with 20-mL portions of ether. The aqueous layer is saturated with ammonium chloride and extracted three times with 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude oily product (ca. 62.4 g) is used for equilibration without further purification (Note 9).\nFigure 1\nb. EQUILIBRATION OF KETONES (2). A solution of 62.4 g of crude 2 in 600 mL of ethanol, 80 mL of water, and 70.0 g (1.2 mol) of potassium hydroxide is refluxed for 3 hr. The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of about 200 mL, and 500 mL of water is added. This aqueous solution is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent is evaporated at reduced pressure. The remaining oily liquid is distilled under reduced pressure at 0.05 mm. Three fractions are collected; the first fraction (boiling range 40\u201380\u00b0C) is discarded. Fraction 2 (boiling range: 80\u2013100\u00b0C; 120\u00b0C oil-bath temperature) consists mainly of biphenyl with small amounts of ketone 2 (Note 10). Fraction 3 (boiling range: 100\u2013110\u00b0C; 140\u00b0C oil-bath temperature) contains the main quantity of ketone 2. Fraction 3 and the decanted liquid of fraction 2 are combined to yield 47.3\u201354.5 g (79\u201391%) of pale-yellow oily 2 (Note 11).\nB.

In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, and a mechanical Hershberg stirrer2 are placed 16.0 g (0.70 mol) of sodium and 220 mL of toluene (Note 12). The solution is heated to reflux and maintained at this temperature. By vigorous stirring a fine suspension of sodium is obtained. To this stirred suspension a solution of 54.5 g (0.24 mol) of equilibrated 2 in 40.8 g (0.68 mol) of 2-propanol (Note 13) is added dropwise at such a rate that controlled refluxing is maintained.

A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a calcium chloride tube, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, a thermometer, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 20.0 g (86 mmol) of 3/4, 10.5 g (86 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline, and 30 mL of diethyl ether. This stirred mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C and a solution of 10.5 g (93 mmol) of chloroacetyl chloride in 30 mL of diethyl ether is added at such a rate that this temperature is maintained. After the reaction is stirred at 0\u00b0C for an additional hr, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, during which time N,N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride precipitates. The reaction is completed by heating to reflux for 3 hr (Note 17). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the crystalline white residue is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and 60 mL of water. The phases are separated and the organic phase is washed thoroughly with an equal volume of water; then it is washed until it is acid-free with a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. It is concentrated under reduced pressure to give about 25.0 g of a viscous oil, which crystallizes on addition of 30 mL of 90% aqueous ethanol. The crystals are filtered with suction to yield 18.6\u201321.8 g (70\u201382%) of the chloroacetate as a mixture of diastereomers.

In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 125-mL graduated, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, 30-mm, egg-shaped magnetic stir bar, nitrogen/vacuum adapter, and an internal temperature probe is placed 1.76 g (6.34 mmol) of the B-methyloxazaborolidine catalyst (Note 1), (Note 19), (Note 20). The apparatus is evacuated, flushed with nitrogen, charged with 86 mL of dry THF and 6.34 mL (63.4 mmol) of borane-methyl sulfide complex, and then warmed to 40\u00b0C (internal temperature) (Note 21). In a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen/vacuum adapter and magnetic stirrer is placed 15 g (63.4 mmol) of 2,2-diphenylcyclopentanone. The flask is evacuated, flushed with nitrogen, and charged with 111 mL of dry THF. After dissolution, the ketone solution is transferred to the addition funnel via cannula and added dropwise over 8 hr to the stirred catalyst solution maintained at 40\u00b0C (Note 22). After complete addition, the funnel is rinsed into the reaction vessel with 10 mL of dry THF, and the resulting reaction mixture is stirred at 40\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. Finally, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C and carefully quenched by the dropwise addition of 100 mL of methanol ( CAUTION: considerable hydrogen evolution occurs after a short induction period) (Note 23). The cold bath is removed and the reaction is stirred until gas evolution ceases (Note 24). The resulting solution is poured into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and the reaction vessel is rinsed with 50 mL of methanol. A simple distillation head is attached to the 1-L flask and 100 mL of solvent is distilled (CAUTION: the distillate contains malodorous methyl sulfide). An additional 100 mL of fresh methanol is added and 100 mL of solvent is again distilled. The residue is cooled to room temperature and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a slightly yellow oil. The oil is dissolved in MTBE (250 mL), washed with aqueous 0.1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the combined acidic, aqueous phases are back-extracted with MTBE (100 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford 15.1 g of an off-white solid. The solid is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 180\u00b0C/0.2 mm) to afford 14.7 g (97%) of (R)-(\u2212)-2,2-diphenylcyclopentanol (92% ee) as an analytically-pure, white solid (Note 25), (Note 26).

To recover the catalyst precursor, (S)-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol, the acidic, aqueous phase is made basic (blue to litmus) by addition of 25 mL of aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a clear oil that crystallizes under high vacuum (0.1 mm, several hours). The solid is recrystallized from hexane to afford 1.5 g (93% recovery) of (S)-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol as a white crystalline solid (Note 29)."

To the cooled (15\u201320\u00b0C) suspension is added phosgene (324 mL, 0.625 mol, 1.93 M in toluene), via a pressure-equalized addition funnel, over a 0.5\u20131.0 hr period maintaining a temperature of 15\u201320\u00b0C (Note 2). The reaction mixture is then aged for 0.5\u20130.75 hr at 30\u201340\u00b0C. The reaction mixture should become homogeneous as the proline reacts with the phosgene to afford the intermediate N-carbamoyl chloride.

The reaction mixture is aged for 1 hr at 0\u20135\u00b0C, filtered, and the magnesium sulfate cake washed with tetrahydrofuran (3 \u00d7 500 mL) (Note 12). The filtrate and tetrahydrofuran washes are combined and concentrated (1 atm) to a volume of 1.0 L (Note 13). The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, aged 1 hr, and then filtered. The cake is washed with water (5\u00b0C, 2 \u00d7 100 mL) and ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 180 mL) (Note 14).

A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 21) is equipped with a Teflon-coated thermocouple probe, 60-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, and distillation head connected to a wide-bore, air-cooled condenser. The flask is charged with 200 mL of xylenes (Note 22) and (S)-diphenylprolinol (50.0 g, 198 mmol). To the vigorously stirred solution at 20\u00b0C is added a 50% (w/w) solution of trimethylboroxine (TMB) in tetrahydrofuran (38 g, containing 19 g, 152 mmol of TMB) (Note 23) dropwise over a 15-min period. The addition funnel is rinsed with dry xylenes (10 mL). During the addition an exothermic reaction occurs (warming the mixture to ca. 35\u00b0C) resulting in the formation of the bismethylboronic acid adduct as a white precipitate (Note 24). After the addition, the mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr, then heated and concentrated by distillation (1 atm) (Note 25) to a volume of ca. 100 mL (Note 26). The mixture is allowed to cool to ca. 60\u00b0C, and is charged with additional dry xylenes (200 mL) (Note 22). The distillation and nitrogen sweep are continued, this time until essentially all the solvent is removed. The mixture is then heated so that the internal temperature is maintained between 160\u2013180\u00b0C for a 0.5-hr period. The pale yellow oil (free oxazaborolidine) is cooled to 20\u00b0C (Note 26) and (Note 27), and diluted with dry xylenes (Note 22) to a volume of 100 mL. The distillation head is replaced with a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. At this point, the nitrogen sweep is discontinued; however, the vessel is maintained under a static atmosphere of nitrogen for the remainder of the reaction. To the well stirred solution is added neat (10 M) borane-methyl sulfide (21 mL, 210 mmol) (Note 23) over a 5-min period via syringe. The mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr at 20\u00b0C, then slowly diluted with dry hexane to a volume of 450 mL over a 1\u20132 hr period (Note 28). After the addition is complete, the mixture is aged for 1 hr at 20\u00b0C, cooled to \u221210\u00b0C, and then aged for 2 hr at \u221210\u00b0C. The mixture is filtered in an enclosed Schlenk filter (Note 29). The cake is washed with dry hexane (3 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 30). The product is dried under reduced pressure (100 mBar, nitrogen sweep, 20\u00b0C) for 1 hr to afford 51\u201353 g of the title compound as a free-flowing white crystalline solid (Note 31),(Note 32).",

The 1-indanone solution is then added dropwise over a 4\u20136 hr period while maintaining the internal temperature of the reaction mixture at \u221220\u00b15\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at \u221220\u00b0C (Note 39). After the reaction is complete, the mixture is cautiously poured into a 1-L flask containing magnetically-stirred, pre-cooled (\u221220\u00b0C) methanol (300 mL) (Note 40). The cooling bath is removed, and the stirred mixture allowed to warm to room temperature (20\u201325\u00b0C). After evolution of hydrogen ceases, the mixture is concentrated by distillation (1 atm) to a volume of ca. 50 mL. Methanol (200 mL) is added, and the distillation repeated (Note 41). The residue containing the product and diphenylprolinol is diluted with methanol (100 mL) and then loaded onto a 2.5 \u00d7 30-cm column packed with Amberlyst 15 (NH+4) (Note 42) at ca. 2.5 mL/min, collecting 40-mL fractions. The column is rinsed with methanol until the product is eluted (Note 43). The column is then rinsed with 1 M methanolic ammonia until the diphenylprolinol is eluted. The fractions containing the product (2\u201315) are combined, and then concentrated under reduced pressure (40\u00b0C, 100 mm) to give 26.2 g of crude product as a white crystalline solid (Note 44). The crude product is dissolved in hexane (260 mL) at 50\u201360\u00b0C in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer. The product is allowed to crystallize as the stirred mixture is slowly cooled to 20\u201325\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for 4 hr at 20\u201322\u00b0C, filtered, and the cake washed with hexane (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The product is dried in a vacuum oven (30\u00b0C, 10 mm) to constant weight to yield 24.1\u201325.2 g (90\u201394%) of the title compound as a white crystalline solid (Note 45) and (Note 46)."

The flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C (internal temperature, ice-salt bath), and hydrogen peroxide (49 mL of a 35% solution, 0.5 mol) (Note 4) is slowly added at such a rate that the temperature remains constant, under vigorous stirring. A precipitate appears immediately and, after completing the addition of hydrogen peroxide, stirring is continued at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr. The mixture is then filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel and the collected precipitate washed with cold THF (3 \u00d7 50 mL) and dried under reduced pressure (2 mm, 35\u201340\u00b0C) in a flask for 2 hr. The yield of DABCO \u00b7 2H2O2 obtained is 28.3 g (63%), m.p. 102\u2013105\u00b0C (sealed tube) with decomposition, softness at 80\u00b0C (lit.3 m.p. 112\u00b0C) (Note 5).",
            "B. Bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide (BTMSPO). A 2-L, three-necked flask, containing a 3-cm stirring bar, and a thermometer, dropping funnel, and an argon inlet adapter, is maintained under a slight pressure of argon. The flask is charged with the DABCO \u00b7 2H2O2 complex (28.3 g, 0.157 mol) and DABCO (28 g, 0.25 mol). Dry dichloromethane (700 mL) (Note 6) is added and the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C. Chlorotrimethylsilane (80 mL, 0.628 mol) (Note 7) is added dropwise, maintaining the temperature at 0\u00b0C, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 5 hr at room temperature. The mixture is filtered through a sintered B\u00fcchner funnel and the precipitate is washed with pentane (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The solution, transferred to a 2-L flask fitted with a vacuum-jacketed, packed column (70 cm long, 4-cm i.d.) and a distillation head equipped with a dry ice/acetone cold finger (Note 8), is concentrated to ca. 80 mL under reduced pressure (Note 9). Pentane (25 mL) is added to the mixture, the additional precipitate is filtered off, and the solution is transferred to a smaller flask, (500 mL). It is concentrated under reduced pressure with the distillation apparatus previously employed to give a residue of 40.1 g (71% yield) of BTMSPO as a clear colorless liquid. It is shown (Note 10) from multinuclear NMR to be contaminated by ca. 8% of hexamethylsiloxane (Note 11).\nFor synthetic purposes the BTMSPO obtained can be used without further purification; on the other hand, distillation (40\u00b0C/30 mm) or column chromatography (Florisil\u2013eluent pentane) does not seem to improve the grade of purity (Note 12). The compound can be stored under nitrogen in a refrigerator for months without any appreciable decomposition."

A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a mixture of water (80 mL), acetone (50 mL, 0.68 mol), and sodium bicarbonate (96 g), is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure equalizing addition funnel containing water (60 mL) and acetone (60 mL, 0.82 mol) (Note 1). A solid addition flask containing Oxone (180 g, 0.29 mol) is attached to the reaction vessel via a rubber tube (Note 2). An air condenser (20 cm length) loosely packed with glass wool is attached to the reaction vessel. The outlet of the air condenser is connected to a 75 \u00d7 350-mm Dewar condenser filled with dry ice-acetone that is connected to a receiving flask (100 mL) cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The receiving flask is also connected in series to a second dry ice-acetone cold trap, a trap containing a potassium iodide solution, and a drying tube. A gas inlet tube is connected to the reaction flask and a stream of nitrogen gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture (Note 3). The Oxone is added in portions (10\u201315 g) while the acetone-water mixture is simultaneously added dropwise (Note 4). The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously throughout the addition of reagents (ca. 30 min). A yellow solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone collects in the receiving flask. Vigorous stirring is continued for an additional 15 min while a slight vacuum (ca. 30 mm, water aspirator) is applied to the cold trap (Note 5). The yellow dioxirane solution (62\u201376 mL, (Note 6)) is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and stored in the freezer (\u221225\u00b0C) over Na2SO4. The dioxirane content of the solution is assayed using phenyl methyl sulfide and the GLC method ((Note 7) and (Note 8)). Generally concentrations in the range of 0.07\u20130.09 M are obtained.\nFigure 1",
            "B. trans-Stilbene oxide. To a magnetically stirred solution of trans-stilbene (0.724 g, 4.02 mmol) (Note 9) in 5 mL of acetone is added a solution of 0.062 M dimethyldioxirane in acetone (66 mL, 4.09 mmol) at room temperature. The progress of the reaction is followed by GLC (Note 10), which analysis indicates that trans-stilbene is converted to the oxide in 6 hr (Note 11). Removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a white crystalline solid. The solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (30 mL) and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The drying agent is filtered off and washed with CH2Cl2. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. Remaining solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give an analytically pure sample of the oxide (0.788 g, 100% yield).

The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator vacuum, and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with ether (200 mL). The organic layer is washed with 100 mL each of water and brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. After filtration and concentration, the resulting residue is distilled using a 5-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure to give 8.8 g (38%) of dimethyl (E)-5-methoxycarbonyl-2-hexenedioate (Note 8).",

            "A. Methyl 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoate (Note 1). An oven-dried, three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a Claisen adapter bearing a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet and rubber septum, and a thermometer. The flask is maintained under a static nitrogen pressure and charged with 5-methyl-5-hexen-2-one (24.20 g, 0.216 mol) (Note 2), trimethyl borate (60 mL) (Note 3), tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) (THF) (Note 4), and freshly activated 20-mesh zinc granules (16.96 g, 0.259 g-atom) (Note 5). The reaction flask is immersed in an oil bath at 25\u00b0C. Stirring is initiated and methyl bromoacetate (39.65 g, 0.259 mol) (Note 6) is added in a single portion through the septum. After an induction time (Note 7), a white precipitate starts to form and an increase of the internal temperature, up to reflux, is observed (Note 8). The mixture is stirred for 3 hr, after which time starting material is completely consumed (Note 9). The reaction is quenched by the sequential addition of glycerol (60 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (60 mL), then is transferred to a separatory funnel using 120 mL of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted again with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with aqueous 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (3 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to afford 37.32\u201338.92 g of crude \u03b2-hydroxy ester (93\u201397% yield) (Note 10).",
            "B. 3,6-Dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid. In a 500-mL flask, the crude ester prepared in Part A (37.00 g, 0.199 mol) is dissolved in a 2 N solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol (130 mL, 0.260 mol). The solution is stirred at 25\u00b0C and disappearance of the starting material is monitored by GLC (Note 9). After 5 hr saponification is complete and the methanol is evaporated at reduced pressure (Note 11). The residue is taken up with water (500 mL), extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the organic phase is discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified (pH 2.5 on universal pH indicator paper) with ~6 N hydrochloric acid (about 60 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 100 mL). These latter ethereal extracts are washed with water (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Evaporation at reduced pressure affords crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid as a viscous yellow oil that can be used in Part C without further purification. Evacuation at 0.5 mm at room temperature with internal magnetic stirring for 24 hr gives 28.07\u201329.40 g (82\u201386% yield) of a solvent-free material (Note 12) and (Note 13).",

A three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and an immersion thermometer, is charged with crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid (29.40 g, 0.171 mol), acetic anhydride (185 mL) (Note 14) and potassium acetate (40.28 g, 0.410 mol). The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. During this time, an exotherm is observed (up to 50\u00b0C) followed by a slow return to room temperature, and the suspension becomes thicker. The reaction is brought to reflux (in ca. 20 min) by means of a heating mantle and stirring is continued for another 3.5 hr. A two-necked, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser and magnetic stirrer is charged with crushed ice (400 g) and water (100 g), and the hot mixture is added carefully with good stirring. Light petroleum ether (500 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with light petroleum ether (4 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3 \u00d7 50 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at ambient pressure to give the crude product as a dark oil. Final purification is achieved by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 15) affording 17.70\u201318.86 g (76\u201381% yield) of a 99% pure mixture (97:3) of the keto olefin isomers as a colorless oil, bp 84\u201385\u00b0C/26\u201328 mm (Note 16)."

The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. Ten cycles of evacuation and argon fill are carried out. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is charged with 6.66 mL (75 mmol) of 2-bromopropene (Note 2) dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) (Note 3). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C by a dry ice/acetone bath, at which point 88 mL of 1.7 M tert-butyllithium in pentane (150 mmol) is introduced dropwise in three roughly equal portions from a 50-mL syringe (Note 4) during 45 min. The colorless reaction mixture is allowed to stir at \u221278\u00b0C for approximately 30 min (Note 5).\nA 250 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a rubber septum and gas inlet, is flame-dried under vacuum, filled with argon, and charged with a solution of diisopropyl squarate (5.94 g, 30 mmol) (Note 6) in dry tetrahydrofuran (150 mL).

The two aqueous layers are combined, acidified (pH <3) with concd HCl, and extracted twice with EtOAc (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with H2O (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is then dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (10 mL) by gentle heating and placed in a freezer (0\u00b0C) for over 1 hr to crystallize the biphenyl. The white solid is filtered off (Note 10), washed with cold MeOH (0\u00b0C, 40 mL), and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual oil is purified by flash-column chromatography on silica gel (70 g, (Note 11)) using 2% EtOAc/hexane (500 mL), 20% EtOAc/hexane (600 mL), and then 30% EtOAc/hexane (1 L) as eluant, to afford the crude \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated carboxylic acid (1.43 g).

The equipment consists of a 250-mL constant pressure addition funnel, a thermometer, and an air-cooled Friedrichs condenser attached to a gas inlet-outlet adapter. A 250-mL vacuum flask is equipped with a gas delivery tube that is inserted through a single-holed rubber stopper and positioned 1 cm above the bottom of an aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide solution. This assembly is used as a gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) trap (Note 2). The flask is charged with mesitylene (Note 3) (76.0 g, 0.630 mol) and its contents cooled to between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C in a wet ice\u2013acetone bath while stirring (Note 4). When the contents of the flask and HCl trap are between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, a 6-mL portion of the total quantity of the chlorosulfonic acid (Note 3) (161.0 g, 92.1 mL, 1.39 mol) is added to initiate the reaction. After HCl gas evolution begins, the remaining chlorosulfonic acid is added at a rate such that the reaction temperature remains below 60\u00b0C (Note 5). After the chlorosulfonic acid is added, the reaction mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C to disperse and dissolve any precipitated salts (Note 6) and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture is poured into 250 mL of ice water with stirring, and the crude crystals are recovered by suction filtration. The crystals are washed with generous portions of ice-cold water. The crude product is taken up in 125 mL of dichloromethane and a 50-mL upper aqueous layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with one 50-mL portion of methylene chloride. The combined organic fractions are dried over sodium sulfate (Note 7) with vigorous stirring, filtered and then concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Crude mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (109.7 g, 80%) is recovered as an oil that solidifies into off-white crystals, mp 54\u201356\u00b0C (Note 8). If used immediately, no additional purification is necessary (Note 9).\nFigure 1\nUsing the equipment in Figure 1, but without the HCl gas trap attached, mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (109.7 g, 0.503 mmol, (Note 7)) is dissolved in 175 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and cooled to between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C in a wet ice\u2013acetone bath. Hydrazine monohydrate (63.0 g, 61.0 mL, 1.26 mol) (Note 3) is dissolved in 30 mL of ice-cold water and added so that the temperature remains below 25\u00b0C (Note 10). After the addition is completed, the mixture is stirred for an additional 45 min at room temperature and poured into 250 mL of ice water with stirring. Crude mesitylenesulfonylhydrazine is recovered by suction filtration and then dissolved in 500 mL of dichloromethane. A 150- to 175-mL portion of water separates. The water layer is removed, and the organic layer is washed with one 50-mL portion of ice-cold water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The crystals are triturated in 250 mL of cold hexane, and the fluffy white product (95.4 g, 89%, (Note 11)) is recovered by suction filtration ((Note 12) and (Note 13)).",
            "B. (1\u03b1,2\u03b1,6\u03b2)-2,6-Dimethylcyclohexanecarbonitrile and (1\u03b1,2\u03b2,6\u03b1)-2,6-Dimethylcyclohexanecarbonitrile (2). The apparatus depicted in Figure 1 lacking the HCl trap and with a glass stopper in place of the thermometer is used for this procedure. The 1-L reaction flask is charged with mesitylenesulfonylhydrazine (56.0 g, 0.262 mol) (Note 1) and 175 mL of acetonitrile. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until solution is attained (Note 14). 2,6-Dimethylcyclohexanone (Note 3) (32.2 g, 0.255 mol) is added in one portion and the reactants are stirred an additional 10 min. A 10-drop portion of concentrated sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 to 18 hr to facilitate complete hydrazone formation (Note 15). Water is circulated through the reflux condenser that is already attached to the flask, and potassium cyanide (27.2 g, 0.418 mol) is added (Note 3). The reaction mixture is gradually heated to reflux over 2 hr and then gently refluxed for 10 to 12 hr (Note 16). The contents of the flask are cooled to room temperature and water (125 mL), 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (25 mL), hexane (175 mL), and ether (75 mL) are added in succession with vigorous mixing. The mixture is stirred for 15 min, and the lower aqueous layer is separated (Note 17). The aqueous layer is extracted with a 7:3 hexane-ether mixture (2 \u00d7 75 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with two 25-mL portions of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution and dried over sodium sulfate. The organic layer is filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the crude yellow residual oil is distilled at 100\u2013102\u00b0C at 39 mm to give 25.5 g (73%) of colorless 2 ((Note 18) and (Note 19))."

            "A. Dimethyl diazomalonate. Into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is placed a large magnetic stirring bar (Note 1), 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide (72.3 mmol, 17.36 g, (Note 2)), acetonitrile (250 mL, (Note 3)), and triethylamine (76.5 mmol, 7.74 g, (Note 4)). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and dimethyl malonate (72.0 mmol, 9.51 g, (Note 4)) is slowly added over 3\u20135 min by a syringe. The reaction mixture is kept at 0\u00b0C for 10 min then stirred at room temperature for 17 hr. A thick white precipitate that forms during the reaction is removed by filtration through a B\u00fcchner filter. The filter cake is washed with a 1:1 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl ether (200 mL, (Note 5)). The resulting filtrates are concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure giving a yellow oil with some visible precipitate of sulfonamide. Repeated trituration and filtration of this oil with 1:1 petroleum ether and ethyl ether (6 \u00d7 50 mL, (Note 5)) to remove the solid 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonamide, followed by concentration of all filtrates by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, gives 10.92 g of the crude diazo product as a yellow oil (96%). The crude product is purified by distillation to provide 8.26 g (73%) of dimethyl diazomalonate as a bright yellow oil (Note 6).",
            "B. 4-Carbomethoxy-5-methoxy-2-phenyl-1,3-oxazole. In an oven-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask is placed a small magnetic stirring bar (Note 7), rhodium(II) acetate dimer, Rh2(OAc)4, (0.230 mmol, 0.102 g, (Note 4)), benzonitrile (19.5 mmol, 2.011 g, (Note 8)), and chloroform (CHCl3, 5 mL, (Note 9)). The flask is placed in an oil bath and fitted with a 30-cm reflux condenser. On top of the condenser is placed a three-way stopcock having horizontal and vertical tubulations. A source of nitrogen (N2) is connected to the system via the horizontal tubulation of the stopcock, and a septum is placed over the vertical tubulation. The entire system is flushed several times with N2, and the solution is heated to reflux (68\u00b0C) during which time it becomes deep purple.\nInto a dry, 50-mL, conical vial is placed dimethyl diazomalonate (29.4 mmol, 4.65 g) and 25 mL of chloroform (Note 9). The solution is taken up into a syringe (Note 10) fitted with a 30-cm needle. The needle is inserted about half way into the septum on the stopcock so that the needle tip extends down into the condenser. The syringe is placed on a syringe pump (Note 11) which is set to add the solution at a rate of 1.17 mL/hr over a period of about 25 hr. After the addition is complete, the syringe is again filled with 2 mL of CHCl3, which is added to the system via the septum. The needle is removed, and the stopcock plug is rotated so that the septum is closed off from the system while the N2 inlet remains open. The solution is allowed to continue stirring at reflux for another 20 hr. It is then concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to yield a brownish-purple oil containing crude product. The crude oxazole is purified using flash column chromatography (silica gel, 40% ethyl acetate in hexane, (Note 12), (Note 13), (Note 14)) to yield 2.73\u20132.96 g (60\u201365%) of 4-carbomethoxy-5-methoxy-2-phenyl-1,3-oxazole as white needles (Note 15)."

The solution is stirred as 114 g (120 mL, 1 mol) of racemic trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane is added carefully in one portion (Note 3). A slurry is formed initially but complete dissolution is observed once addition is complete. Glacial acetic acid (50 mL) is then added in one portion (Note 4). Product begins to precipitate during the addition, and continues to precipitate while the reaction mixture is allowed to cool from 90\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C, with stirring, over 3 to 4 hr.

The filtrate is concentrated, first by rotary evaporation and then at \u22641 mm for 1 hr, yielding 23.3 g of the imine as a slightly yellow oil.\nTo the 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing the above imine are added a magnetic stirring bar and dry THF (180 mL) under an argon atmosphere. To this stirring solution is added lithium diethyl phosphite (Note 10) via a 12-gauge cannula. After 20 hr at ambient temperature the reaction mixture is quenched by addition of water (200 mL) and most of the THF is removed by rotary evaporation. The aqueous layer is then saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 300 mL) (Note 11), and the combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration and rotary evaporation furnish 39-45 g of a pale yellow oil that is dissolved in 50% ethyl acetate-hexane (50 mL) and purified by flash chromatography [9-cm column, 800 g of Silica Gel 60 (Note 12), eluting with 1.2 L of 50% ethyl acetate-hexane followed by 6 L of 60% ethyl acetate-hexane , 35 mL/min, 125-mL fractions after a 2-L forerun; product Rf = 0.5, 2:1 ethyl acetate-hexane].

The mixture is cooled to 2\u00b0C in an ice-water bath. To the mixture is added 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (24 mL, 0.157 mol) (Note 5) dropwise via syringe. (Caution: The DBU addition causes an exotherm. The reaction temperature is maintained below 5\u00b0C by carefully controlling the rate of addition. For this reaction the addition required 35 min). A thick white precipitate forms during the DBU charge. The reaction is stirred at 1\u00b0C for 1 hr, and then it is warmed to room temperature and stirred under nitrogen for 24 hr (Note 6). The resulting homogeneous reaction is diluted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, 170 mL), and water (100 mL) is added. After the water layer is removed, the organic phase is washed with water (100 mL) and 0.5 M citric acid monohydrate (100 mL). The organic layer is dried ( Na2SO4 ) and concentrated under reduced pressure to ca. 40-50 g of a pale yellow oil (Note 7).

Hydrobromic acid (48%,123 mL, 1.09 mol) is added at room temperature and the mixture is cooled to \u221213\u00b0C with stirring (Note 3). Nitrogen, N2, is bubbled through the solution and sodium nitrite (42.8 g, 0.62 mol) is slowly added in small portions (ca. 5 g every 15 min) (Note 4). After each addition, the reaction mixture turns brown and then the color slowly fades, but the solution does not decolorize entirely. The total time required for addition of all the sodium nitrite is approximately 2.5 hr. The solution is then allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C, the N2 purge is stopped, and the mixture is stirred for 6 hr. Excess nitrogen oxides are removed by bubbling N2 through the solution for 1 hr. The pale green solution is then extracted with ether (6 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic extracts are concentrated to 0.5 L by rotary evaporation and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After filtration, the ether is evaporated and the residual solvent is removed under reduced pressure (0.1 mm). The pale yellow or green oil (74-75 g, 87-89%) is used immediately in the next reaction without purification (Note 5), (Note 6), (Note 7).\nPotassium (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Potassium glycidate). The crude acid from the preceding step (74.5 g, 0.44 mol) is dissolved in absolute ethanol (300 mL) and cooled to \u221220\u00b0C. Under N2, a filtered solution of potassium hydroxide (86%, 55.5 g, 0.85 mol) in absolute ethanol (300 mL) is slowly added. After 2 hr, the mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C and stirred at this temperature for 14 hr. The solution is filtered to remove precipitated salts. Half of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation without warming and an additional crop of salt (2-4 g) is isolated by filtration. The combined salts are dried under vacuum to give 105 g of a 1 : 1 mixture of KBr and potassium glycidate .\nOne third of this mixture (35 g) is extracted by refluxing in a mixture of 585 mL of absolute ethanol and 15 mL of water in a 1-L flask with good stirring for 45 min (Note 8). After filtration of the hot suspension, the glycidate crystallizes from the filtered solution to give 12-13 g of product. Another third of the 1 : 1 KBr-potassium glycidate mixture is heated at reflux with stirring in the mother liquors for 45 min. After the second batch of crystalline potassium glycidate is isolated by filtration, the procedure is repeated with the last portion of the KBr-glycidate mixture. The solids collected from the three hot filtrations are combined and extracted a fourth time with the same solution, then crystallized to give additional product. After drying, the total weight of recrystallized potassium glycidate is 47-50 g. This salt contains 9.5-13% of KBr , and the yield is thus 74-80% (corrected for KBr content) (Note 9), (Note 10).\nEthyl (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Ethyl glycidate). A suspension of dry potassium glycidate (26 g of an 90.5:9.5 potassium glycidate:KBr mixture, 0.186 mol), benzyltriethylammonium chloride (42.4 g, 0.186 mol), and ethyl bromide (76 g, 0.7 mol) in methylene chloride, CH2Cl2, (300 mL) is heated at reflux for 16 hr with good stirring (Note 11). The solvent and excess ethyl bromide are then slowly removed by rotary evaporation without warming, and the resulting viscous solid is triturated with anhydrous diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL) to extract the ethyl glycidate . The combined ethereal extracts are filtered and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is slowly removed by rotary evaporation (without warming) and the residue is distilled at 40\u00b0C (2.4 mm) with 0\u00b0C water circulated through the condenser to afford 17.6 g of ethyl glycidate (81%) (Note 12), (Note 13)."

Potassium carbonate, 25.0 g (0.180 mol), is dissolved in 200 mL of water (Note 4) in a separate 250-mL Schlenk flask. In a third flask (25-mL Schlenk flask) 3.30 mg (0.02 mmol, 0.2%) of palladium acetate (Note 5) is dissolved in 10 mL of acetone . All three flasks are then thoroughly degassed by four freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Under an argon back flow, one of the stoppers on the three-necked flask is replaced with a rubber septum, and the carbonate and catalyst solutions are added via cannula to form a biphasic mixture. The top layer turns brown upon addition of the catalyst. The septum is replaced with the glass stopper and three additional freeze-pump-thaw cycles are applied. The flask is then backfilled with argon, and the reaction is brought to reflux under a positive argon pressure. After 2 hr at reflux the heat source is removed and the reaction is allowed to cool. By this time the brown color has faded and the reaction is a triphasic mixture with copious amounts of palladium black floating between the layers. The reaction is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted into diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The organic layers are combined, washed with water (1 \u00d7 100 mL) saturated with sodium chloride , and dried over magnesium sulfate .

A dry, 5-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer adapter, and a condenser is charged with 417 g (3.06 mol) of pentaerythritol (Note 1) and 730 g (9.24 mol) of pyridine (Note 2). A Drierite drying tube is attached to the condenser, and the addition funnel is closed with a glass stopper after being charged with 1.134 kg (9.53 mol) of thionyl chloride (Note 3). The reaction flask is placed inside a bucket to which an ice/water mixture may be added in the event that the reaction becomes too exothermic. Thionyl chloride is added dropwise with vigorous stirring to the slurry so that the white mist that appears in the flask does not rise up into the condenser. Thionyl chloride is added as rapidly as possible over 4-5 hr so that the temperature of the yellow-orange reaction mixture is maintained between 65-95\u00b0C (Note 4). When the addition is complete, the drying tube is removed, and the ice bucket is replaced with a heating mantle. The resulting orange-yellow reaction mixture is heated to 120-130\u00b0C until no more sulfur dioxide is evolved (Note 5). As the heating continues, the reaction mixture turns from dark orange to brown, and gas evolution becomes evident. After gas evolution ceases, the flask is cooled slightly and 2 L of cold water is added with stirring. The brown-yellow product precipitates, is filtered, and washed with 2-3 L of water. The dried, crude product (461 g) is approximately a 1:2.8 mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride (131 g) and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin (330 g, 57% yield) (Note 6). This crude material may be used directly in the next step (Note 7).",
            "B. Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propanoic acid . (Caution: Nitrogen oxides are highly toxic. This procedure should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood!) The crude mixture (461 g) of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin obtained from the above reaction is transferred to a 3-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask that is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, and an addition funnel. The transfer is most easily accomplished by melting the solid over a steam bath and pouring the mixture through a funnel directly into the reaction flask. The flask and its contents are heated to 70-80\u00b0C with a heating mantle (Note 8), and a small portion (10-15 mL) of concentrated nitric acid (Note 9) is added with vigorous stirring to initiate the reaction (Note 10). As the reaction begins, a large amount of dark orange-brown vapors appears. Stirring is continued, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed after the initial exothermic reaction subsides (usually within 15 min). The remaining nitric acid (660-680 mL) is added in 20-30-mL aliquots over 30 to 60 min so that nitrogen oxides are continually evolved but the reaction does not become violent. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is carefully removed and left in the hood to air out and is replaced by a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is heated at 70-80\u00b0C until the evolution of nitrogen oxides is no longer evident (Note 11). At this point, the biphasic reaction mixture is a cloudy yellow or white liquid. The warm reaction mixture is poured into a 4-L beaker and 2 L of cold water is added is to precipitate the tetrachloride/carboxylic acid product mixture. The beaker and its contents are allowed to stand for several hours at room temperature to ensure complete precipitation of the product; then the crude product mixture is filtered, washed with water, and the carboxylic acid is extracted as follows. The solid is pulverized, transferred to a 4-L beaker, and 2.5 L of 1 M sodium hydroxide is added with stirring (Note 12). The liquid reaction mixture instantly becomes bright yellow, and the insoluble, white tetrachloride clumps on the sides of the beaker. Stirring is continued for 30-60 min whereupon the insoluble material is filtered and washed well with water. The combined washings and yellow, aqueous filtrate are acidified to pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (~250 mL). The carboxylic acid precipitates as a white solid that is easily filtered using two pieces of filter paper. The filtered and dried product thus obtained is a fine white powder (230 g, 65% yield). The aqueous filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride ; the extracts are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated to provide an additional 50-60 g of the desired acid. The crude, combined product (75% yield) can be used directly in the next step (Note 13). Over several runs, the yield varies from 65-80%.",
            "C. 3-Chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-1-propene . Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid (205 g, 1.00 mol) is transferred to a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask. On top of the powdery acid, which nearly fills the flask, is placed a football magnetic stir bar (1.25 \u00d7 0.5 in.). The neck of the flask to be clamped is wrapped well with aluminum foil and is fitted with a glass stopper. A standard taper 24/40 short path still head, to which is attached a Drierite drying tube, is attached at the second neck. The upper flask and short path column are wrapped with aluminum foil, and the flask is immersed in a high temperature oil bath (Note 14) that has been preheated to a stable 210\u00b0C. As the solid melts, the reaction mixture becomes yellow, and the oil bath temperature drops (10-20\u00b0C). If after 10-15 min, the temperature does not rise to between 205-215\u00b0C, it may be necessary to adjust the heating to maintain the oil bath temperature between 205-215\u00b0C (Note 15). Moderate stirring is maintained throughout the reaction (Note 16). Within 30 to 60 min, gas evolution becomes apparent, the reaction mixture turns brown, then black, and the product begins to distill. As the reaction proceeds, a black, tarry residue begins to build up on the bottom and sides of the flask. The product begins to distill, slowly at first, then quite steadily, at which point the head temperature rises to 138\u00b0C (Note 17). The reaction time varies (Note 17), but heating is continued until just before dryness. The product (115 g, 92% yield) thus obtained is a clear, colorless liquid (bp 136-138\u00b0C) that is > 98% pure by GLC and 1H NMR analysis (Note 18). Over several runs, the yield varies from 88-99%."

After 1 hr, the bath is removed and the reaction mixture is heated to 40\u00b0C (internal temperature) with an oil bath. The vigorously stirred mixture is maintained at this temperature for 4 days (Note 6). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, diluted with 500 mL of water, and filtered through a pad of Celite on a glass-fritted funnel (pore size C), using a water aspirator (Note 7). Up to an additional 1-L of water is used to rinse the thick black reaction mixture from the flask. The resulting golden-yellow filtrate is discarded (Note 8). The black, solid residue in the frit, and any material remaining in the reaction flask are transferred to a 1-L beaker with pentane, acetone, and a glass rod, and the solution is vigorously stirred with an additional 500 mL of a 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetone and pentane for 30 min. This mixture is filtered through a glass-fritted funnel using a minimal layer of Celite. The Celite pad is washed thoroughly with 1:1 pentane/acetone solution, and the resulting brown filtrate is dried over magnesium sulfate . Concentration using a rotary evaporator, followed by distillation under reduced pressure (bp 75-85\u00b0C/0.4 mm), and low temperature (ca. \u221220\u00b0C) recrystallization from pentane (ca. 1 mL/g of product), provide 70-95 g (60-80% yield) of the product as small, white crystals (mp 47.5-50\u00b0C) (Note 9) and (Note 10).",
            "B. [1.1.1]Propellane (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that has been flame dried under reduced pressure and purged with argon, is equipped with a vacuum adapter equipped with an argon balloon, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a pressure-equalizing, 150-mL addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with a 25-g (0.085 mol) portion of material obtained from part A, and 25 mL of pentane (Note 11). A diethyl ether solution of methyllithium, 132 mL of a 1.4 M (0.185 mol) solution (Note 12), is transferred to the addition funnel via cannula under a flow of argon. The reaction flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and the methyllithium is added over 15 min with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is maintained at \u221278\u00b0C for 10 - 15 min; then the \u221278\u00b0C cooling bath is replaced with an ice-water bath (0\u00b0C), and the addition funnel is replaced with a rubber septum equipped with an argon balloon. Stirring is continued for an additional hour; then the volatile materials are transferred under reduced pressure to a flame-dried flask that is cooled to \u2212196\u00b0C (Note 13). Based on the recovery of the thiophenol adduct, the yield of [1.1.1]propellane is between 75 and 88%.\nDetermination of the yield of propellane. Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated (Note 14). Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.\nWiberg and Waddell also noted that propellane reacts with iodine in 88% yield.2 Alber and Szeimies report a somewhat lower yield (61%) when an ethereal solution of propellane is treated with a solution of iodine in ether/pentane while being irradiated.3 Thus, titration of a portion of the resulting propellane solution with iodine provides an estimate of the minimum yield. A 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred as noted above. Small pieces of iodine are added with stirring under room light over 10 min until just before the dark color persists. Concentration of the solution provides 1,3-diiodobicyclo[1.1.1]pentane from which the minimal concentration of the propellane solution and minimal yield of propellane may be estimated if iodine is not added in excess. Alternatively, a solution of iodine in diethyl ether/pentane may be added instead of neat iodine."

The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and stirred at room temperature for 48 hr. The resulting oil is taken up in ethyl acetate (300 mL) and washed once with water (200 mL). The aqueous layer is back-extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and the combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After concentration under reduced pressure, the resulting clear oil is fractionally distilled to give 102.1 g (79%) of methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenebutanoate as a colorless liquid, bp 62-63\u00b0C (1 mm) (Note 2).",

When the addition is completed, heating is continued for 1 hr more (Note 7). A solution of 30.0 g (0.13 mol) of methyl 2-(benzylamino)methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is slowly added dropwise to the well stirred Grignard solution (Note 8) over a period of 3 hr at room temperature.

The combined organic layers are washed with brine (500 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting orange oil is purified by passing it down a short silica gel column (elution with 5% methanol in dichloromethane).

The solution is cooled in an ice bath before 4.0 mL (0.052 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride (Note 11) is introduced. The mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (2 \u00d7 150 mL) and brine (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to leave 14.3 of orange oil (Note 12).\nThe oil is immediately dissolved in 200 mL of dry benzene and transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask to which is added 7.73 g (0.051 mol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU (Note 13).

The flask is cooled in an ice bath during the portionwise addition of 96 g (0.28 mol) of methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (Note 3), and the resultant mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 0\u00b0C. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue is refluxed for 30 min with a mixture of ether:petroleum ether (3:7, 100 mL). The process is repeated three times, the combined extracts are filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to yield a colorless oil. The oil is purified by silica chromatography [ 1 kg of silica, 8.5-cm \u00d7 43-cm column eluting with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether (3:7)] to yield 39.5 g (78%) of methyl (4S)-4,5-O-isopropylidenepent-(2Z)-enoate , and 4.8 g (10%) of the corresponding trans-isomer, both as colorless oils (Note 4), (Note 5).\nA solution of 39.0 g (0.21 mol) of the cis-alkene in 100 mL of methanol is treated with concd sulfuric acid (ca. 0.8 mL of 30%), and the mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature.

The apparatus is purged with argon. The sodium sulfonate is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath and the addition funnel is charged with 80 mL (1.10 mol) of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) (Note 14). The slow, dropwise addition of SOCl2 to 1 is accompanied by generation of sulfur dioxide, SO2 (Note 15).

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (0.40 mL, 0.38 g, 5.2 mmol) (Note 16) is slowly added via syringe resulting in a substantial increase in the evolution of SO2 (Note 17). The solution is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0\u00b0C during which time evolution of SO2 ceases. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight, resulting in a white precipitate (Note 18). The reaction flask is fitted with a short path distillation head and excess SOCl2 is distilled off at reduced pressure (Note 19). Twice the resulting white paste is diluted with 50 mL of hexanes and the residual SOCl2 and hexanes are removed under reduced pressure.

The flask is charged with 30.0 g (0.294 mol) of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxane (Note 1), 200 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 2), and 0.5 mL of a 1.0 M solution of zinc chloride in anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 3). The solution is stirred under a positive pressure of nitrogen and 25.0 mL (0.352 mol) of acetyl chloride (Note 4) is added dropwise over a 10-min period, resulting in a slightly exothermic reaction; the resulting solution is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature. A separate 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 500-mL addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet, is charged with 61.0 mL (0.350 mol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Note 5), 45.0 mL (1.11 mol) of anhydrous methanol (Note 6), and 60 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 2), and the flask is cooled in an ice-bath. The chloromethyl ether acetate solution is rapidly transferred to the addition funnel via a double-tipped needle under a positive pressure of nitrogen and the solution is added dropwise over a 15-min period to the mechanically stirred, ice-cold solution of alcohol and amine. Copious quantities of ammonium salt form during the addition. After the addition is completed, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The entire two-phase reaction mixture is then transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask and volatile components are removed by rotary evaporation at water aspirator pressure. Pentane (ca. 20 mL) is added to the residue and the flask is cooled in an ice-bath for 1 hr to induce crystallization of the ammonium salt. The entire two-phase mixture is then filtered with suction through 50 g of neutral alumina (Note 7) contained in a 4.3-cm \u00d7 15-cm medium porosity, sintered-glass funnel and the salt is washed well with pentane (ca. 500 mL). Concentration of the combined filtrate and washings by rotary evaporation at water aspirator pressure affords 40.0-47.2 g (77-91%) of essentially pure 1-acetoxy-3-(methoxymethoxy)butane (Note 8).

Quinine, 111.11 g (0.31 mol) (Note 4), is then added in one portion (Note 5), followed by 87.1 g (0.78 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 6) added in one portion. The slurry is heated to reflux with an electric mantle for 8 hr (Note 7). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool overnight to room temperature and then to 5-10\u00b0C with an ice-water mixture. 2 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl), 400 mL , is added slowly keeping the temperature below 20\u00b0C. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel with 300 mL of 2 N HCl . After two layers separate, the lower aqueous layer is collected in a 3-L Erlenmeyer flask, and the organic layer is washed with 2 N HCl (2 \u00d7 250 mL). The combined aqueous layers are cooled to 0-5\u00b0C and treated dropwise with 260 mL of 5 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with stirring to pH 9.5. An oil initially separates that becomes a yellow solid after vigorous stirring at 0-5\u00b0C. The solid is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel, rinsed with water (2 \u00d7 200 mL), and dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 48 hr to afford the ketone 1 as a light yellow solid weighing 97.9 g (98%, (Note 8)).",
            "B. N-Benzoylmeroquinene tert-butyl ester (2). A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, subsurface glass-fritted gas tube for oxygen (O2) addition (the gas tube is also connected to a bubbler containing silicone oil to monitor the flow of oxygen gas), and a thermocouple. The flask is charged with 800 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 200 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (tert-BuOH). The solution is purged with O2 under stirring for 15 min and then treated with 78.4 g of potassium tert-butoxide (0.70 mol) in one portion (Note 9). The yellow reaction mixture is cooled (ice bath) while the O2 addition is continued for another 15 min. Crude quininone 1, 90.0 g, (0.28 mol) is then added portionwise over 10 min with continued O2 addition, resulting in a blood red mixture, concomitant with an exotherm to 35\u00b0C (Note 10). After the solution is stirred for 1.5 hr at ambient temperature, the gas purge is stopped and 80 mL of glacial acetic acid (HOAc) is added carefully with vigorous stirring. Volatile material is removed under reduced pressure at \u2264 50\u00b0C from the resulting thick slurry that is then suspended in 400 mL of water. The pH is adjusted to 10 by the addition of 60 mL of concd ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and the aqueous solution is extracted with ether (4 \u00d7 200 mL), washed with a saturated solution of brine (3 \u00d7 250 mL, (Note 11)), dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated (Note 12) to furnish meroquinene tert-butyl ester as a viscous oil (40.5 g, 64% crude recovery, (Note 13)). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, addition funnel, condenser, and N2 inlet is charged with 40.5 g (0.18 mol) of crude meroquinene tert-butyl ester and 235 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (Note 14). Pyridine, 16.0 mL, (0.19 mol), (Note 15) is added, followed by dropwise addition of 25.0 mL (0.21 mol) of benzoyl chloride (Note 15) at a rate to maintain a gentle reflux over 15 min. Upon complete addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 hr (Note 16) and washed successively with H2O (200 mL), 1 N HCl (2 \u00d7 150 mL), 2 N NaOH (2 \u00d7 150 mL), and brine (300 mL). The organic phase is dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the thick brown oily benzamide 2 (61.2 g, 100%, (Note 17)).",
            "C. 4a(S),8a(R)-2-Benzoyl-1,3,4,4a,5,8a-hexahydro-6(2H)-isoquinolinone (3). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, Teflon-coated thermocouple, 500-mL addition funnel and a N2 inlet. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 275 mL is added to the flask and the flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C under N2. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of 56.0 g (0.17 mol) of crude benzamide 2 in 60 mL of CH2Cl2, that is added dropwise over 15 min, maintaining the internal temperature between 0-10\u00b0C. Upon complete addition, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for another 2 hr (Note 18) as the temperature rises to 30\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is poured onto 1 kg of crushed ice with stirring and when the ice has melted the two layers are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted further with CH2Cl2 (4 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (2 \u00d7 500 mL), brine (500 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to a light brown semisolid (Note 19) that is dissolved in 100 mL of CH2Cl2 and precipitated with 250 mL of hexanes to furnish 34.7 g (80%) of enone 3 as light yellow crystals (Note 20).",
            "D. 4a(S),8a(R)-2-Benzoyloctahydro-6(2H)-isoquinolinone (4). Palladium (Pd), 10% on carbon, 4.0 g , (Note 21) is placed in a 500-mL Parr bottle under N2 and carefully wetted with 50 mL of cold denatured ethanol (EtOH). A slurry of 34.7 g of enone 3 (0.14 mol) in denatured EtOH (250 mL) is added and the Parr shaker apparatus assembled. After the system is purged with nitrogen-hydrogen (N2/H2), the reaction is shaken at 50 psi H2 and 50\u00b0C until H2 uptake is complete (1 hr, (Note 22)). The catalyst is filtered over a Celite pad (Note 23) and rinsed with warm chloroform (CHCl3) (4 \u00d7 75 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, dissolved in 90 mL of CH2Cl2 and crystallized with 200 mL of hexanes. The crystalline solid is filtered, rinsed with hexanes and dried to afford 34.3 g (98%, (Note 24)) of the ketone 4, representing a 51% yield over four steps."
