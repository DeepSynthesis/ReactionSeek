The flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus (Note 4) containing a thimble with 30 g of an oven-dried Na2CO3 and sand mixture in a 3:1 ratio (Note 5). An additional 50 mL of chlorobenzene is added to partially fill the thimble-chamber of the Soxhlet apparatus. The mixture is refluxed at 185 \u00b0C (external temperature) open to the atmosphere (Note 6), and after only 15 min the color of the solution turns from green to dark blue. After 10 h the vessel is removed from the oil bath, the Soxhlet extraction apparatus is removed, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield a blue, glass-like solid residue. 2-Propanol (100 mL) (Note 7) is added to the same flask, and the solid residue is mixed vigorously with 2-propanol for 30 seconds using a metal spatula to dissolve chlorobenzene that is entrapped in the residue (Note 8). The 2-propanol is evaporated from the solid residue under reduced pressure to give a purple powder suitable for filtration (Note 9). Acetone (100 mL) is added to dissolve excess e-caprolactam contained in the powder, and the solid is gravity-filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel and then washed with an additional 50 mL of acetone (Note 10).

The product is purified by column chromatography (Note 27). Fractions containing the product are combined, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg). The remaining white solid is dissolved in diethyl ether (20 mL) at room temperature. The solution is heated to 35 \u00b0C and then cooled to room temperature whereupon a white powder crystallizes from the solution. Diethyl ether is removed using a pipette.

The reaction mixture is cooled to 5 \u00c2\u00bfC with an ice bath and water (50 mL) is added through the addition funnel over 30 min while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 \u00c2\u00bfC. Caution! The addition of water is exothermic. Isopropyl acetate (IPAc) (50 mL) is added and the mixture is cooled to 5 \u00c2\u00bfC with an ice bath. The pH of the mixture is adjusted to 8\u00c2\u00bf8.5 using 19M NaOH solution (~48-49 mL) while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 \u00c2\u00bfC with an ice bath. Caution! The addition of NaOH is exothermic. The solid precipitate is filtered off with a B\u00c2\u00bfchner funnel. The filter cake is washed with IPAc (10 mL). The filtrate mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with IPAc (50 mL) and the organic phases are combined. The combined organic phases are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00c2\u00bfC, 30 mmHg) to afford a brown residue. The residue is dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and charged on a column (5 \u00c2\u00bf20 cm) of 200 g of silica gel (Note 17). The column is eluted with 1 L of EtOAc and fraction collection (50-mL fractions) is begun after 500 mL of solvent is eluted. Elution is continued with 1 L of 10% MeOH/EtOAc and the desired product is obtained in fractions 12-22 (Notes 18 and 19), which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00c2\u00bfC, 30 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil. The oil is dried under vacuum (30 mmHg) at ambient temperature (20\u00c2\u00bf25 \u00c2\u00bfC) for a minimum of 24 h to afford 9.00-9.07 g (85%) of a light yellow solid (Notes 4, 20, and 21)."

            "A. 5,6,11,12-Tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (1). A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, an internal thermometer and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (capped with a rubber septum), is flame-dried and purged with argon. Degassed THF (200 mL) (Note 1) is added and subsequently granular lithium (6.63 g, 956 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2). The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of freshly sublimed \u03b1,\u03b1'-dibromo-o-xylene (101 g, 382 mmol) in degassed THF (150 mL) (Note 3). This solution is then added dropwise to the stirred suspension of granular lithium over a period of 1.5 h, which begins to reflux after 20 min. During the period of addition the internal temperature of the mixture is kept between 65 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C (Note 4). After complete addition, the mixture is refluxed for 2 h (oil bath) until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the substrate (Notes 5, 6 and 7).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then, for removal of residual lithium, filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5.0 cm diameter, porosity 0) under an atmosphere of argon. The funnel is subsequently rinsed with THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at a bath temperature of 40 \u00b0C (255-225 mmHg) and then at 50 \u00b0C (7.5 mmHg) for 1 h in order to remove THF (Note 8). Dichloromethane (700 mL) is added to the residue. After stirring for 2 min, insoluble material (Note 9) is removed by filtration with a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 4) filled with silica gel (100 g) (Note 10). The residue is washed with dichloromethane (700 mL) and the filtrate dried over Na2SO4 (50 g). The latter is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (675-525 mmHg and then 15 mmHg) for 1 h. The crude product remains as a pale yellow semifluidic mass (40.5 g), which solidifies under vacuum overnight (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg). Finally, the product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-175 \u00b0C, 0.25 mmHg) (Note 11) to yield pure 1 (19.6 g, 49%) as colorless plates (Note 12).",
            "B. 5,11-Dibromo-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]-cyclooctene (2).Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condensor and a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, 1 (19.2 g, 92.3 mmol) is dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (200 mL) (Note 13). NBS (35.3 g, 198.4 mmol, 2.15 equiv) (Notes 14 and 15) is added, and the stirred mixture is then refluxed at 85 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature). After 2 h NMR analysis (Note 16) indicates complete consumption of the starting material 1 (Note 17). The hot suspension (65 \u00b0C) is filtered through a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), and the remaining succinimide is washed with carbon tetrachloride (400 mL) (Note 18). The solvent of the filtrate is evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 225 to 18 mmHg). A pale yellow residue remains, which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask, poured into a fritted glass funnel (7.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), washed with distilled water (300 mL) and dried overnight under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg) to give 35.4 g of crude 2 as a pale yellow solid (Note 19).",

Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 2 (34.1 g crude product) is dissolved in THF (150 mL) (Note 1). Under an atmosphere of argon in a second flame-dried, 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium tert-butoxide (41.6 g, 371 mmol, 4 equiv, assuming 100% purity of 2) (Note 20) is dissolved in THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The resulting cloudy solution is then cooled with an ice bath. At 0 \u00b0C the solution of 2 is transferred through a teflon tube (1.5 mm internal diameter) over a period of 15 min into the 500-mL flask. During the period of addition the color changes from orange to brown and finally to black. Then the ice bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 2 h until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the dibromide 2 (Notes 21 and 22). Distilled water (15 mL) is added and the black mixture is poured onto a pad of silica gel (diameter 10 cm x 4 cm height) that has already been wetted with diethyl ether. The pad is rinsed with 700 mL of diethyl ether, and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction, dried over Na2SO4 (40 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (675 to 75 mmHg) and then at 15 mmHg for 1 h. The crude product remains as a brown solid (18.5 g) (Note 23), which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask and dried overnight under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg). Purification by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-145 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) (Note 24, 25) affords 13.0 g (69%, two steps from 1) of dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3) as colorless plates (Note 26)."

            "Although many convenient and reliable precursors of benzyne have been prepared and utilized in organic synthesis,2 a hypervalent iodine-containing molecule, (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2) , has been developed for service as an efficient and mild benzyne precursor. The major developments over the past years have been the improvement of methods of synthesis of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor and the applications to related reactive intermediates. The summary will be reported in this Discussion Addendum.\nImprovement of Hypervalent Iodine Precursor\n2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2 generates benzyne more efficiently than other benzyne precursors such as benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate, o-dihalobenzenes (1,2-bromofluorobenzene and 1,2-dibromobenzene), and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate. The efficiency of this benzyne precursor 2 is attributable to the high leaving group ability of hypervalent iodine groups, which has been discussed previously.3 Hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor 2 was prepared in two steps from inexpensive and commercially available 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Initial preparation of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) by reaction of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Me3SiCl in the presence of Mg and a catalytic amount of I2 in HMPA is followed by transformation into 2 by the reaction with PhI(OAc)2 activated with TfOH in CH2Cl2. However, several drawbacks remained: (1) use of toxic HMPA solvent and severe conditions for the preparation of 1, (2) difficulty for introduction of functional groups, and (3) low solubility of the hypervalent iodine species in most organic solvents.\nTo improve the reaction procedure, an alternative benzyne precursor, 2-(hydroxydimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate (5), has been prepared in three steps starting with 1,2-dibromobenzene.4 This process avoids the use of carcinogenic HMPA and severe reaction conditions (high temperature and long reaction time). The reaction of 5 with Bu4NF under mild conditions generates benzyne efficiently, which provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. Therefore, 5 is a convenient alternative benzyne precursor. Incorporation of synthetically important carbonyl groups into hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors is difficult, because carbonyl groups cannot tolerate Grignard conditions. Synthesis of benzyne precursors bearing the carbonyl groups has been accomplished using pyran-2-ones as starting materials. Reaction of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with methyl 2-pyrone-5-carboxylate or 5-acylpyran-2-ones at 200 \u00b0C in a sealed tube affords the corresponding methyl 3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzoate5 or 1-acyl-3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-benzenes6 in good to high yields, which can be converted to 2-(trimethylsilyl)-phenyliodonium triflates 6, which contain carbonyl groups, by treatment with PhI(OAc)2 and TfOH. Treatment of 6 with Bu4NF in CH2Cl2 generates benzynes that contain ketone functionality, and reaction with furan provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. In general, hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors are stable solids and easy to handle, but they do not dissolve in most organic solvents. To improve the solubility of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, long-chained precursors (7) have been synthesized.7 As the alkyl chain of benzyne precursors 7 is lengthened, the solubility in non-polar organic solvents and the yield of the benzyne adduct with furan gradually increases.\nFigure 1.Improvements of synthetic procedures for hypervalent iodine precursors.\n1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) is the key starting material for the synthesis of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2. Recent improvement on the synthesis of 1 have been reported in which 1,2-dibromobenzene is used instead of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The use of Rieke magnesium or Mg turnings/1,2-dibromoethane8 and Fe-catalyzed DIBAL-H activated Grignard reaction have led to improved reactions.9 Through these variations, severe reaction conditions and the use of toxic HMPA solvent can be avoided.\nFigure 2. Improvements of synthesis of 1.\nOther Applications Using Hypervalent Iodine\nWhen hypervalent iodine and silyl groups are contiguous, fluoride ion can trigger the concerted elimination reaction of these two groups. This method is applicable not only to the generation of benzyne, but also to the generation of reactive intermediates related to benzyne. Thus, 2,3-didehydronaphthalene (8),10 bicycle[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-yne (9),11 dehydro-o-carborene (10),12 2,3-didehydrothiphene (11),13 and 2,3-didehydropyrrole (12)14 have been generated by this method. Benzobisoxadisiloles have been applied to synthesis of hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, which can serve as the synthetic equivalents of 1,4-benzdiyne (13) and related species.15\nFigure 3.

To this homogeneous yellow mixture, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine 2 (4.04 mL, 23.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. As soon has the first drop is added, the reaction mixture quickly changes to a dark reddish-orange color, but the mixture remains homogeneous throughout the addition without detectable exotherm. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (5.31 mL, 30.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise (1-2 min), which results in a slight cloudiness, but no exotherm is detected during or after addition. The flask is closed with a septum (Note 6) and the reaction mixture is stirred in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C. During the warming process, the dark reddish-orange color lightens somewhat, but the mixture remains cloudy. The reaction is stirred for 18 h at 70 \u00b0C after which time the dark reddish-orange reaction mixture is homogeneous. The reaction is judged to be complete by the disappearance of the starting ester by TLC (Note 7). The mixture is cooled to room temperature (Note 8) and de-ionized water (2 mL) is added dropwise with a Pasteur pipette over a period of ca. 2-3 min with efficient stirring while a persistent cloudiness develops. Precipitation/crystallization of the product occurs rapidly after the addition, giving rise to a very thick dark-red suspension (Note 1). After formation of the suspension, water (150 mL) is added in 10 mL portions over a period of ca. 5 min. During the addition of water the mixture becomes slightly warm to the touch. The resulting dark-orange to dark-yellow suspension of product is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h.

The solids are allowed to dry for ca. 1-2 h under air suction on the filter funnel.

The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 \u00b0C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid (Note 18) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",

A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 19), DMF (30 mL) (Note 20) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) (Note 21) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 \u00b0C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4 (Note 11). The stirred mixture (Note 22) is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) (Note 23) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid (Note 25). The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) (Note 26) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid (Notes (Note 24) and (Note 27)). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper (Note 28) and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 29). The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid (Note 30)."

            "Reductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful methodology primarily because its products are excellent substrates for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Since 2003, the Organic Syntheses article and the primary references have been cited over 100 times. This discussion addendum aims to provide a brief overview of recent developments in this methodology. Improvements and variations of \u03b1-acetoxy ether formation, as well as the synthetic utility of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers will be discussed. Recent applications in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products are also included.\nImprovements and Variations of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ether Formation\nThe original reductive acetylation protocol involves the addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBALH) as a 1.0 M solution in hexanes to the ester at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting aluminum alkoxide is then treated with pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) sequentially. The internal temperature during these additions should not exceed -72 \u00b0C in order to maximize the yield and prevent undesired side reactions.2 While this method is general, recent developments include the use of asymmetric electrophiles in order to generate more complex acyl ethers and the extension of reductive acetylation to lactams and imides.\nShortly after the original article, Rovis and Zhang reported the use of acid fluorides as competent reagents for the trapping of such aluminum alkoxides, the results of which are summarized in Figure 1.3 Aryl, vinyl, and alkyl acid fluorides are all effective trapping reagents (67-97% yield) and steric bulk is well tolerated (pivaloyl fluoride = 92% yield). This development allows access to more complex acyl acetal derivatives without sacrificing a full equivalent of the acid, which represents an improvement in atom economy over the use of symmetric anhydrides.\nFigure 1. Acid Fluorides as Trapping Reagents.\nMore recently, Dalla and co-workers have extended reductive acetylation strategy to the formation of \u03b1-acetoxy pyrrolidines (Figure 2).4 While DIBALH will reduce imides, the resultant aluminum alkoxide is not nucleophilic enough to react with acetic anhydride. Therefore, the reductant of choice for the preparation of \u03b1-acetoxy amines is lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH), whose lithium alkoxide is sufficiently nucleophilic for effective trapping with acetic anhydride.\nFigure 2. Formation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Pyrrolidines.\nA variety of N-alkylated imides, shown in Figure 3, afford \u03b1-acetoxy lactams in high yields (75-100%), with the notable exception of cases where there is \u03b1-branching with respect to the nitrogen substituent (e.g. the imide of \u03b1-methylbenzylamine, MeBn). Steric bulk on the imide also limits the conversion to the \u03b1-acetoxy lactams, as shown by the modest yield for the bis-OTBS imide. Despite these limitations, this reductive acetylation strategy offers rapid entry into N-acylimium ions for use in Mannich reactions.\nFigure 3. \u03b1-Acetoxy Lactams from Imides.\nSynthetic Utility of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nTreatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers with a Lewis acid (commonly BF3\u00b7OEt2, MgBr2\u00b7OEt2, TMSOTf, SnCl4 or TiCl4) results in the formation of an oxocarbenium ion, which can be intercepted by a variety of nucleophiles to afford a new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond adjacent to an ether linkage. The scope of such transformations has been investigated in the context of diastereoselective nucleophilic additions. \u03b1-Acetoxy ethers are also useful substrates for cascade sequences, such as oxonia Cope-Prins and Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclizations. The use of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet Spengler reactions have also been examined.\nThe use of \u03b1-(trimethylsilyl)benzyl alcohol as a chiral auxiliary has been investigated by Rychnovsky and Crossrow for diastereoselective additions to oxocarbenium ions generated from \u03b1-acetoxy ethers.5 This chiral auxiliary was chosen due to the ease of preparation of both enantiomers and facile deprotection or conversion to the benzyl ether. Treatment of the \u03b1-acetoxy ether with a variety of nucleophiles, including allyl silanes, silyl enol ethers, and silyl ketene acetals, in the presence of TMSOTf proceed in high yields (87-98%) and high diastereoselectivities (20:1 to 80:1), as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, (E)-crotyltrimethylsilane affords the syn product in high yield and diastereoselectivity (82%, 27:2.4:1). The addition of cyanide and ethyl nucleophiles proceed in high yields (97% and 75% respectively), albeit with modest diastereoselectivity (5:1 and 4:1).\nFigure 4. Diastereoselective Additions of Nucleophiles.\nRychnovsky and Dalgard have reported on the expedient synthesis of tetrahydropyranones through an oxonia Cope-Prins cyclization.6 This strategy, outlined in Figure 5, involves a reductive acetylation of an ester 1, followed by treatment with TMSOTf to generate oxocarbenium ion 3. The pendant allyl moiety participates in a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to generate oxocarbenium ion 4, which is poised for a Prins cyclization (intramolecular Mukaiyama aldol reaction) with the silyl enol ether to afford tetrahydropyranone 5. This transformation is effective for a variety of substrates (Figure 6) affording the tetrahydropyranone product in high yields (77-99%), including those bearing quaternary centers adjacent to the ketone.\nFigure 5. 2-Oxonia Cope-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 6. Synthesis of Tetrahydropyranones.\nRovis and Epstein have also utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in a cascade sequence to provide 4-amino tetrahydropyrans through a Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclization.7 As shown in Figure 7, treatment of 4-acetoxy-1,3-dioxane 6 with TMSOTf generates oxocarbenium ion 7, which upon treatment with allyl silane affords alkene 8. In the presence of TfOH, acetal cleavage results in formation of oxocarbenium ion 9, which undergoes a Prins cyclization to give carbocation 10. Addition of a nitrile to the carbocation affords 4-amino tetrahydropyran 11 after hydrolysis.\nFigure 7. Sakurai-Ritter-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 8. Synthesis of 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nThe Sakurai-Ritter-Prins reaction is effective for a variety of dioxane derivatives, as shown in Figure 8. This transformation affords the 4-amino tetrahydropyran products in good yields (59-88%) and high diastereoselectivies (90:10 to 99:1). It should be noted that 2-substituted allyl silanes (Figure 9) and a variety of nitriles are effective partners in this transformation.7\nFigure 9. Synthesis of Quaternary 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nJacobsen and Doyle have utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers as substrates in the development of enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet-Spengler reactions (Figure 10).8 An ester derivative of tryptophol was reduced and trapped to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 12. In the presence of a thiourea catalyst 13, TMSCl, and BaO, oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent ring closure afforded tetrahydropyrano-indole 14 in good yield (82%) and good enantiomeric excess (79%).\nFigure 10. Organocatalytic Asymmetric Oxa-Pictet-Spengler Cyclization.\nHighlighted Applications in the Total Synthesis of Complex Natural Products: Intramolecular Allylation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nKadota, Yamamoto and co-workers utilized reductive acetylation to unite two complex fragments in their highly convergent synthesis of marine neurotoxin gambierol (19).9 The strategy, shown in Scheme 1, begins with the coupling of ABC acid to FGH alcohol via Yamaguchi esterification. The resulting ester 15 is then subjected to reductive acetylation conditions. While\nScheme 1. Kadota and Yamamoto's Total Synthesis of Gambierol.\nAc2O is an effective trapping reagent, chloroacetic anhydride provided increased yield and proper diastereoselectivity for the subsequent ring closure. Treatment of the resulting \u03b1-acetoxy ether 16 with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves afforded effective closure of the 6-membered D ring in high yield (87%) and modest diastereoselectivity (2:1) with respect to the acyclic ether. The resulting diene 17 is primed for a ring closing metathesis to forge the 7-membered E ring. The complex polycyclic ether framework 18 was then further elaborated to gambierol (19).\nScheme 2. Kadota's Total Synthesis of Brevenal.\nA similar approach was employed in Kadota and co-worker's total synthesis of the nontoxic brevetoxin antagonist brevenal (23).10 As shown in Scheme 2, the 7-membered D ring arose from the reductive chloroacetylation of ester 20, followed by treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 21 with magnesium bromide etherate and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieves. The resulting oxocarbenium ion was then trapped by the allyl stannane to afford the tetracycle 22 in good yield as a single diastereomer (52% from the ester 20). This cyclization again sets the stage for a ring closing metathesis sequence to afford a pentacycle, which was elaborated to brevenal (23).\nThe authors also reported a second-generation strategy (Scheme 3) where acyclic a0cid 24 is coupled to ABC alcohol 25.10-b This route employs the same reduction/cyclization sequence to forge the E ring in good yield as the single desired diastereomer (57% from the ester 26) and sets up the closure of the D ring in an analogous fashion.\nScheme 3. Kadota's Second Generation Strategy to Brevenal.\nRecently, the total synthesis of ciguatoxin CTX3C (34) by Yamashita and co-workers employed reductive acetylation to facilitate a radical cyclization to give the C ring of tridecacyclic natural product (Scheme 4).11 The AB acid and E alcohol were subjected to Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the ester 29. Following reductive acetylation, \u03b1-acetoxy ether 30 underwent transacetylation in the presence of diisobutylaluminum phenylselenide to afford the \u03b1-seleno ether 31 in high yield (83% from the ester). The \u03b1-seleno ether 31 was carried through 3 steps before C-ring radical cyclization was initiated by triethylborane and oxygen in the presence of tributyltin hydride to provide sulfoxide 33 in good yield as a single diastereomer (86%). This approach offered increased stereoselectivity over a direct allylation strategy (as in gamberiol). Sulfoxide 33 was then carried forward to afford ciguatoxin CTX3C (34).\nReductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful method for the construction of complex cyclic ethers via intramolecular allylation. The strategy has played a key role in the preparation of brevetoxin-like ladder polyethers.12 The method's utility is largely due to the ease with which substrates can be brought together by a Yamaguchi esterification. This protocol allows for a highly convergent and flexible approach to these marine natural products.\nScheme 4. Yamashita's Total Synthesis of Ciguatoxin CTX3C.\nIntermolecular Couplings of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers and Silyl Enol Ethers\nCrimmins and DeBaillie utilized reductive acetylation to install the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety of the tetrahydropyran fragment of the marine cytotoxin bistramide A (38).13 The synthetic strategy is outlined in Scheme 5. The lactone 35 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (7:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 with (E)-3-penten-2-one in the presence of excess TMSOTf led to formation of tetrahydropyran 37, a key building block for the synthesis of bistramide A (38), in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (9:1).\nScheme 5. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Bistramide A.\nRychnovsky and co-workers used a related strategy to construct the western tetrahydropyran fragment of marine cytotoxin leucascandrolide A (43).14 As shown in Scheme 6, the lactone 39 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 in high yield (91%) and high diastereoselectivity (15:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 with silyl enol ether 41 in the presence of catalytic zinc bromide led to formation of tetrahydropyran 42 in high yield (92%) and good diastereoselectivity (20:1). Tetrahydropyran 42 was then further elaborated to leucascandrolide A (43).\nScheme 6. Rychnovsky's Total Synthesis of Leuscandrolide A.\nThe most complex example of such intermolecular couplings comes from Crimmins and co-workers recent synthesis of the cancer cell growth inhibitor (+)-irciniastatin A (48).15 This convergent strategy is outlined in Scheme 7. Reduction of lactone 44 followed by trapping with Ac2O proceeds to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 in quantitative yield. Treatment of the sterically hindered \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 with boron trifluoride etherate followed by a slight excess of the highly functionalized silyl enol ether 46 gave tetrahydropyran 47 in good yield (59%; 85% based on recovered ketone) and high diastereoselectivity (>20:1). Tetrahydropyran 47 was then carried forward to afford (+)-irciniastatin A (48).\nScheme 7. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Irciniastatin A.\nReductive acetylation followed by intermolecular coupling has proven to be a useful strategy for coupling complex fragments in total synthesis.16 The success of this methodology is largely due to the functional group compatibility of the reduction and mild conditions for oxocarbenium ion formation. Furthermore, the coupling itself often proceeds in high yield and high diastereoselectivity. These features validate this method as a highly convergent process in complex natural product synthesis."

            "The olefin metathesis reaction has emerged as a widely used transformation in organic chemistry and materials science.4 In keeping with the theme of our original article, this discussion addendum provides an overview of current large-scale ring-closing metathesis (RCM) applications of the Ru-based family of metathesis catalysts, the structures of which are shown in Figure 1.5\nFigure 1. Commonly Used Olefin Metathesis Catalysts.\nIn our 2003 report for the preparation of N-Boc-3-pyrroline , we utilized 0.5 mol% of catalyst 1 in a refluxing (2.5 h) 0.4 M solution of N-Boc-diallylamine in CH2Cl2. The report also described an extractive method for removing Ru-derived catalytic species/impurities using the water-soluble P(CH2OH)3, readily prepared from a commercially available fire-retardant aqueous formulation of P(CH2OH)4Cl. Following Kugelrohr distillation, this method reliably provided ca. 30 g of crystalline N-Boc-3-pyrroline in 90-94% isolated yield. Concurrent with the development of our procedure, Helmchen reported6 a 100 g preparation of Boc-3-pyrroline using 0.1 mol% of ethylidene 2a in a room-temperature (15 h) 0.57 M CH2Cl2 solution of N-Boc-diallylamine. Catalyst deactivation or removal procedures were not taken and the product was isolated in 98% yield after vacuum distillation. This transformation has also been reported to proceed in 87% yield when run neat and with catalyst 5 loading as low as 500 ppm.7\nSince the time of our report, however, RCM has rapidly matured and has been used to prepare kilogram quantities of structurally complex macrocyclic synthetic intermediates within the pharmaceutical industry. Optimizing a large-scale RCM process requires that several conditions be studied, namely, substrate type and functional group compatibility, catalyst selection, and solvent/temperature/time requirements. In many applications, removal of residual ruthenium is also a concern. In this Discussion Addendum, large-scale industrial RCM processes will be used to frame the relevant issues. These examples include Boehringer-Ingelheim's Hepatitis C protease inhibitor BILN-2061, GlaxoSmithKline's cathepsin \u039a inhibitor SB-462795, and RCM-tethered macrocyclic peptides. The discussion will conclude with an overview of developments in the area of ruthenium removal.\nFigure 2. SB-462795 and BILN-2061 and their RCM disconnections.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the 2006 and 2009 RCM processes for construction of the BILN-2061 peptide macrocycle.\nBoehringer-Ingelheim's 2006 disclosure8,9,10,11,12,13 of a large-scale RCM approach to the hepatitis C viral protease inhibitor BILN-2061 provides an interesting case study for those contemplating a large-scale metathesis process. The BILN-2061 metathesis substrate is an unnatural tripeptide-derived diene, which closes to a (Z)-olefin-containing 15-membered ring. Two of the conformation-restraining amide bonds are endocyclic, and two additional macrocyclic torsional degrees of freedom are fixed by the presence of the five-membered proline ring and an endocyclic trans-cyclopropane. The optimized 2006 RCM process (Figure 3) was scaled up to produce >400 kg of cyclized product.10 Three years later, the BI group reported a higher-yielding and order-of-magnitude greener procedure, one which dramatically reduced the amount of time, solvent, and catalyst loading.13\nThe first efforts to construct the BILN-2061 macrocycle used catalyst 1.9 These trials were met with problematic epimerization at the \u03b2-carbon of the vinylcyclopropyl amino acid residue (Figure 4). When a mono-phosphine catalyst such as 3 was used, the epimerization reaction was not observed. Analysis of model systems revealed that the rearrangement was facile when the bis-phosphine catalyst 1 was used. The rearrangement could also be promoted by adding one equivalent of phosphine to a mixture of catalyst 3 and the model system (Figure 4). The origin of this rearrangement was suggested to occur via the intermediacy of bis-phosphino or amino phosphino ruthenacyclopentene intermediates.9,11 Further studies revealed that the site of catalyst initiation in the macrocycle precursor depended upon the substitution of the aminocylopropylcarboxylic acid nitrogen atom: acyl-type substituents such as N-Boc shifted the initiation to the rearrangement-stable nonenoic residue (Figure 4).12 Before this detail was known, the reasonably efficient 2006 process using diene 7 and catalyst 3 was plagued by problematic batch inconsistencies. Traces of morpholine (<20 ppm) in the toluene solvent were shown to be responsible for substrate isomerization and catalyst inhibition, with the former arising from bis-ligated Ru species of the type discussed earlier. These problems were alleviated by acid-washing the solvent prior to the metathesis reaction.\nFigure 4. Catalyst-specific epimerization observed in RCM reactions of BILN-2061 substrates, suggested ruthenacyclopentene intermediates, and the effect of N-Boc substitution on site of catalyst initiation.\nThe aminocyclopropyl metathesis rearrangement encountered by the BI group was unexpected and highly substrate-specific. The most common side reactions in metathesis processes are alkene isomerization reactions.14 Because of the reversible nature of olefin metathesis, isomerization can alter unreacted starting material or products. It can be problematic in reactions where the catalyst is stressed by temperature or time or in some product purifications involving direct distillation from Ru-containing pot residues.15 For example, ring closure of diallyl ether 19 to 20 with catalyst 4 (Figure 5) is a rapid reaction, but significant product isomerization to vinyl ether 21 can occur at extended reaction times. Rearrangement is thought to arise from Ru-H species; it can be suppressed by solvent selection16,17 or by additives such as tricyclohexylphosphine oxide,18 acetic acid or 1,4-benzoquinones,19 phenylphosphoric acid,20 chlorocatechol borane,21 or Cy2BCl.22\nFigure 5. Select rearrangements observed in Ru-catalyzed metathesis reactions.\nRearrangement chemistry is the desired outcome in some applications. For example, Ru-catalyzed rearrangements are used for selective O-allyl23 and N-allyl24 deprotections. The latter, an allylamine to enamine transformation, was observed in lactam-piperidone 22 when treated with catalyst 1 in refluxing toluene (Figure 5). Olefin migration can also occur in hydrocarbon chains. For example, attempts to ring-close cyclopentanone-derived diene 25 with catalyst 4 did not return the [9.5.0] ring system.25 Instead, the monosubstituted double bond was found to migrate at a rate faster than 9- or 8-membered ring closure, leading to exclusive generation of the [7.5.0] product 26. Another strategy purposefully adds a hydride source to promote rearrangement after ring closure. For example, enol ether 28 is formed in 82% yield by first performing an RCM reaction on diene 27 to form the seven-membered ring product, which is then isomerized in a second step involving addition of NaBH4 to the Ru-containing reaction mixture.26\nNon-metathesis side reactions have also been reported in the context of Ru-promoted metathesis reactions. Hoye and Zhao have reported fragmentation reactions in RCM substrates containing secondary allylic alcohols; in sluggish metathesis reactions these systems can fragment to the methyl ketone.27 Kharasch additions of CHCl3 to olefins, as catalyzed by 1 at 65 \u00b0C, are also known.28\nAlthough the problem of isomerization was largely solved and the RCM reaction was utilized at kg scale, the 2006 BILN-2061 process suffered from several other drawbacks. The first of these was the dilute substrate concentration (0.014 M), which required excessive solvent consumption. A study of the macrocyclization behavior of different acyclic dienes and dimeric intermediates revealed a 27-fold improvement in the effective molarity (EM) of cyclization, which translated to a 0.2 M RCM process.12 A significant shortening of the reaction time was also realized. As mentioned earlier, an N-Boc group at the vinylcyclopropane amide residue was found to productively shift the site of catalyst initiation and led to a more facile and robust ring-closing reaction. While adding protection-deprotection steps, the improved 2009 process could therefore be run at higher concentrations and temperatures and with lower catalyst loadings (0.1 mol% 6 vs. 3 mol% 3). Each of these factors contributed in a positive manner to the EM of cyclization. Although the details will not be considered here, one of the principle steps in optimizing the BILN-2061 macrocyclization was defining conditions which (i) minimized formation of dimeric compounds arising from acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) processes,29,30 and (ii) one in which these oligomers could be equilibrated to product.\nThe BILN-2061 RCM reaction optimization is best viewed in terms of green chemistry considerations. The 2009 process13 represented a significant savings in terms of time, energy, and material. The RCM step was reduced to minutes instead of hours. Scrupulous degassing and solvent purification was necessary for the 2006 process, whereas the new process only required a brief degassing boil-out. The 2006 RCM process required as much as 150,000 L solvent per metric ton of diene, whereas the 2009 process reduced this amount to 7,500 L/MT. Because catalyst loading was greatly reduced in the 2009 process, Ru removal was likewise less resource-intensive. The 2006 process used excess 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (2 kg/1 kg diene) and aqueous bicarbonate to remove a portion of the soluble ruthenium, with subsequent silica gel and charcoal filtrations necessary to reduce Ru levels to 10 ppm in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In contrast, the 2009 process used 50-fold less 2-mercaptonicotinic acid and did not utilize silica or charcoal filtrations. The Sheldon E-factor,31 which is the ratio of waste mass to product mass, improved to 52 (computed for the 2009 Boc protection/RCM/Boc deprotection process) from 370 (computed for the 2006 RCM process).\nLarge-scale RCM was also used in GlaxoSmithKline's 2009 synthesis of the seven-membered azapane ring in cathepsin K inhibitor SB-462795 (Figure 6).32 The metathesis step in this synthesis also required multiple optimization attempts. Initial efforts using diene 29 and catalyst 5 were stymied by the need for high catalyst loadings (5-10 mol%). Substrate-catalyst coordination was suspected to be the source of the problem, but reactions using Ti(O-iPr)4 as a chelation inhibitor33,34 were not successful due to substrate/product decomposition. Additionally, large residual Ru levels were deemed a safety hazard with downstream steps involving H2O2 (for chiral auxiliary removal) and an acyl azide (for nitrogen insertion via Curtius rearrangement). To complicate matters, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone RCM product 30 decomposed via a retro-aldol reaction when the basic P(CH2OH)3/NaOH ruthenium removal procedure was employed. These setbacks led to the design of N/O-protected RCM precursor 31. This substrate closed with lower catalyst loadings (1-2 mol%) but gave capricious levels of olefin migration when attempted with crude product coming out of a Curtius rearrangement employing hydrazine and t-butyl nitrite/HCl (Figure 6). Solvent swaps or isomerization inhibitors (acetic acid, styrene, or Cy3PO) did not suppress the isomerization. The RCM process was made tractable by purifying precursor diene 31 as the HCl salt. When converted to the free base, it reliably provided 32 as a crystalline product in 90% yield using 1-2 mol% of catalyst 5. A basic cysteine wash was used to remove Ru; this thiol-based approach was utilized after it was discovered that (i) formaldehyde, generated during in situ generation of P(CH2OH)3, added to the carbamate nitrogen of product 32 to form hydroxymethylated 35, and (ii) residual P reagents proved problematic for subsequent olefin hydrogenation.\nFigure 6. Selected RCM reactions used in the synthesis of SB-462795.\nAn alternative route to SB-462795 employed RCM precursor 36 containing a phthalimide-protected trans-1,2-aminoalcohol moiety. In comparison with diene 31, this substrate offered a significant improvement in the RCM process, although here again significant optimization efforts were directed at identifying and minimizing trace impurity catalyst inhibitors.35 Highly purified material could be closed in quantitative yields with as little as 0.25-0.5 mol% catalyst 5. Olefin migration was not observed, even in reactions using crude material. When conducted in toluene, the product readily crystallized and provided material with low residual Ru content after the slurry was washed with P(CH2OH)3/NaHCO3.36 According to the published account, both approaches were amenable to large-scale manufacturing and the trans-1,2-aminoalcohol route was used to provide over 200 kg of SB-462795.\nOther publicly disclosed pharmaceutical applications of RCM involve its use to conformationally constrain37,38,39 and alter the metabolic profile of helical peptides by forming peptide macrocycles.40 Scale-up aspects of this chemistry remain proprietary, but much of the exploratory work has been on solid support,41 with microwave-assisted RCM macrocyclizations.42,43 Many examples undergo efficient RCM reactions, and in a solution-phase study of minimal RCM constraints in 310-helical peptides, it was found that high E-selectivity could be realized in an unoptimized 18-membered macrocyclization (38\u219239, Figure 7) catalyzed by 5-7 mol% 4 in refluxing dichloromethane.44\nFigure 7. Representative helical peptide macrocyclization and work-up procedures.\nThe reactions shown in Figure 7 highlight two additional methods for post-RCM reaction processing: (i) the use of ethyl vinyl ether as a Ru catalyst poison (by formation of the stable Fischer carbene) prior to evaporation and silica gel chromatography (SGC), and (ii) a Ru removal procedure utilizing the commercially available, albeit expensive, tris(hydroxymethyl)-phosphine.15,45\nThe BI and GSK investigations show that large-scale RCM reactions can require significant optimization. It is expected that these paths will shorten as more applications are reported. These two examples reveal that at-scale process applications can utilize as little as 0.1-0.5 mol % Ru catalyst, which minimizes the waste stream and is in accord with sustainable green chemistry practice. Sustainable concepts in olefin metathesis have been reviewed elsewhere.46 Pharmaceutical applications require that the API contain <10 ppm metal, and the two industrial examples discussed here utilized water-solubilizing procedures using 2-mercaptonicotinic acid,13 cysteine,32 or tris(hydroxy-methyl)phosphine.36 Downstream processes such as hydrogenation over charcoal-based catalysts can also be used to reduce Ru levels to <1 ppm.35 Other approaches to remove Ru include amine-functionalized mesoporous silicates,47 polar isocyanides,48 lead tetraacetate,49 activated carbon/silica gel,50 and DMSO or triphenylphosphine oxide treatment of crude reaction mixtures.51 DMSO/DMF mixtures have been used to remove colored Ru impurities in solid-phase RCM applications.52 A recent report describes the use of 15% aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an efficient Ru removal agent; this process also oxidizes residual phosphine and carbene ligands to more polar entities, thus easing purification in some cases.53"

The flask is submersed in an ice/water bath, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir gently until its temperature reaches 3-4 \u00b0C. Concurrently, a flame-dried, 100-mL recovery flask is charged with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (9.28 g, 45.0 mmol, 1.01 equiv) (Note 1). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated (<1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, then charged with dichloromethane (15 mL) using a 20-mL plastic syringe, and swirled gently to dissolve the solid. The resulting solution is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred reaction mixture using a 20-mL plastic syringe (Note 2). A white precipitate appears about 5 min into the addition. At no point does the internal temperature rise above 6 \u00b0C. To achieve quantitative transfer, the recovery flask is rinsed with approximately 5 mL dichloromethane, and the resulting solution is added to the reaction mixture in one portion via a 20-mL plastic syringe. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 5 min before the cold bath is removed. After 3.5 h, the precipitate is removed via vacuum filtration (150 mmHg) through a B\u00fcchner funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with an additional 50 mL of dichloromethane, which is poured into the B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (<30 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear, colorless oil that contains a small amount of white solid.

The resulting opaque solution is cooled with gentle stirring in an acetone/dry ice bath to an internal temperature of -52 \u00b0C (Note 7). The stirring rate is increased, and a solution of 2.5 M n-butyllithium in hexanes (40.0 mL, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise over 20 min via a 20-mL plastic syringe. A white precipitate begins to form less than 1 min into the addition. Upon completion of the addition, the flask is fully submersed in the dry ice bath to bring the internal temperature to -70 \u00b0C. The viscous reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at this temperature for 1.5 h. On occasion, the stir bar stops stirring in the thick slurry and is dislodged using the thermometer. During this time, a flame-dried, 500-mL pear-shaped flask is charged with iodine (25.4 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and diethyl ether (100 mL) (Note 5) is added via a 20-mL plastic syringe. The resulting suspension is swirled vigorously by hand for approximately 5 min before the deep red supernatant is transferred to the pressure-equalizing addition funnel via cannula. The residual solid iodine is taken up with vigorous stirring in 30 mL of diethyl ether, which is again transferred to the addition funnel via cannula.\nFinally, the sides of the addition funnel are rinsed with approximately 10 mL of ether using a 20-mL plastic syringe, and the ethereal solution of iodine is added dropwise over 25 min (Note 8) to the stirring slurry of acetylide. Upon completion of the addition, a substantial mass of iodine is scraped from the tip of the addition funnel into the reaction vessel using a spatula. The cold bath is removed, and the solution is allowed to warm to 20 \u00b0C over 2.5 h. A septum is removed, and distilled water (100 mL) is added cautiously through the open neck. The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the organic phase is isolated. The aqueous phase is extracted with hexanes (100 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with two 200-mL portions of water, followed by 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (150 mmHg), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear, light yellow oil that is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottom flask and distilled under vacuum using a short-path still (Note 9) to give 19.9 g (84%) of iodoalkyne 4 as a clear, colorless liquid (Note 10).",

A white precipitate appears within the final minute of the addition. After 15 min, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for 1 h. The reaction flask is again placed in an ice bath and, after 5 min, treated with iodoalkyne 4 (75 mmol, 17.7 g), added dropwise over 10 min via a 10-mL plastic syringe. The solution is stirred for 30 min, the ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 1.25 h. The flask is once more immersed in the ice bath, and the mixture is allowed to stir for 15 min before a septum is removed and glacial acetic acid (30 mL) (Note 11) is added slowly via a 100 mL graduated cylinder. After replacing the septum, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 2.25 h. Finally, the mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (30 mL) (Note 11) and deionized water (50 mL). The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, shaken, and the aqueous phase is discarded. The organic phase is washed with water (3 x 50 mL), and dried over magnesium sulfate (5 g). The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration (150 mmHg), and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear oil, containing small amounts of a white precipitate. This suspension is applied to a silica plug and eluted with hexanes (Note 12).

            "Several methods are available for the direct formylation of phenols, but most of them suffer from lack of regioselectivity. Moreover, several of the methods involve the use of noxious reagents and harsh reaction conditions resulting in moderate to good yields of aldehydes.3 An exception is the formylation of phenols using the acceptable reagents MgCl2, Et3N and paraformaldehyde giving high yields of salicylaldehydes from reactions exclusively at the ortho-position.4 Additional examples and applications of this method since its appearance in 1999 are presented here. We have emphasized the scope of the reaction and its participation in one-pot preparations.\nScope of the ortho-Formylation Reaction\nNumerous applications of the formylation reaction have been reported in the past twelve years. A number of substituted phenols have been successfully formylated (Figure 1). Alkyl and alkoxy substituents promote the formylation, with high to excellent yields of salicylaldehydes being obtained (Figure 1).4,5 Highly substituted phenols undergo the reaction; for example, reaction of the phenol 1 furnished the salicylaldehyde 2 in 62% yield.6Surprisingly, however, \u03b1,\u03c9\u2013bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes were unreactive towards the method.7\nFigure 1. Ortho-formylation of phenols using MgCl2, Et3N and para-formaldehyde.\nThe method has been used for the formylation of estrogens.8,9 The reactions occurred to provide excellent yields of regioisomeric aldehydes, with high preference for the 2-isomer (Table 1, Figure 2).\nTable 1. Results from ortho-formylation of estrogens.\nR1 R2 R3 Regioisomeric ratio of 2- and 4-isomers Yield%\nOH H H 13:1 92\nOH CCH H 6:1 86\nOH CH2CH3 H 12:1 90\nH OH H 13:1 85\nOAc H H 8:1 90\nOH H OH not determined 15\n=O H 9:1 90\nOCH2CH2O H 12:1 74\nThe practical use of this method was demonstrated with the synthesis of the anti-cancer agent 2-methoxyestradiol (3) from estradiol in 36% overall yield (Figure 2).9\nFigure 2. orthoo-Formylation of estrogens.\nAromatic substituents have no detrimental effect on the reaction. Phenyl-,10 perfluorophenyl-11 and 2-nitrophenyl-substituted11 phenols were formylated in good yields, and the same was the case with mono-protected 2,2\u00b4-bisphenol.12 Naphthol derivatives behave similarly giving ortho-formylation products,13,14 and of special merit is the preparation of 3-formyloctahydro-1,1\u00b4-binaphthol.14b 5-Methoxy-2-naphthol was formylated in 75% yield as part of the total synthesis of racemic juglomycin A.15\nOxygen functions are well tolerated; several mono protected resorcinols and methylenedioxy- substituted -phenols have been formylated in excellent yields and high regioselectivity.16,17 Moreover, several methylthio- and phenylthiophenol derivatives have been formylated in high yields.18 Halogen-substituted phenols are good substrates in the reaction,4 and this has been thoroughly substantiated in the last decade.19\nFigure 3. Ortho-formylation of mono-protected resorcinols.\nThe method also tolerates electron attracting groups like cyano and ester, but the reaction proceeds at a slower rate when these groups are attached to the benzene ring, and more byproducts may appear as well.4 As anticipated, faster reactions were encountered when the ester group was further removed from the benzene ring. Formylation of 4 gave 5 in 94% yield20 and reaction of the phenol 6 furnished aldehyde 7 in high yield (Figure 4).21 The presence of two ester groups was accepted; formylation of dimethyl 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)succinate proceeded with excellent yield.22 Moreover, protected tyrosine, viz. methyl N-Cbz-tyrosinate was successfully formylated in 43% yield.23 Since the formylation of 4-cyanophenol was successful,4,24 it is interesting to note that (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetonitrile could not be formylated by the different methods tried.25\nFigure 4. Examples of ortho-formylations.\nThe Formylation Method as Part of One-pot Reactions\nMuch can be gained with respect to efficiency and yields by using multi-component one-pot reactions, since several reactions can be carried out successively without isolation of intermediates. The reagents of this method appeared compatible for such a set-up, and several applications have been reported.\nThe catechol structural entity is present in natural products, many of biological interest. A one-pot preparation of catechols from the corresponding phenols has been reported26 involving the formylation reaction followed by Dakin or Baeyer-Villliger oxidations. The yields are very good (Figure 5). The method has been used in the synthesis of combretastatins A-1 and B-1.27\nFigure 5. One-pot synthesis of catechols.\nSalen ligands, that form part of the Jacobsen catalyst, were prepared in excellent yields by a one-pot reaction starting from the appropriate phenol (Figure 6).28 The yields are considerably better than those previously obtained by a two-step protocol.\nFigure 6. One-pot synthesis of salens.\nBy another one-pot reaction, salicylamines were prepared in good yields by reductive amination of the corresponding salicylaldehydes as outlined in Figure 7. The amines were further manipulated without isolation of intermediates to dihydro-2 H-1,3-benzoxazines in good overall yields, considering the four reactions involved.29 In a related one-pot procedure salicylnitriles were prepared.30 In this case the imines formed from the respective salicylaldehyde and ammonia were oxidized with o-iodoxybenzoic acid to give good yields of the corresponding nitriles.\nFigure 7. One-pot synthesis of salicylamines and dihydro-2H-1,3-benzoxazines.\nCinnamic acid derivatives are useful for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Converting phenols to salicylaldehydes and subsequent treatment with methyl (triphenylphosporanylidene)acetate in a one-pot reaction afforded methyl 2-hydroxycinnamate derivatives in acceptable yields (Figure 8).31\nFigure 8. One-pot synthesis of methyl cinnamates.\nConclusion\nThe results have demonstrated that the method described above fits well into the assembly of phenol formylation reactions. It may prove to be the method of choice in many cases because of the ease of execution, regioselectivity, and good yields."

The septum is then changed to a glass stopper equipped with a teflon ring (Note 8) under constant argon flow. The glass stopper is secured with a metal clamp, the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and the reaction mixture is heated to 100 \u00b0C. After the reaction mixture reaches 100 \u00b0C the two taps are closed (Notes (Note 9) and (Note 10)). After 24 h the tap connected to the bubble counter is opened to release pressure. The second tap connected to the argon inlet is subsequently opened and the reaction vessel is allowed to cool for 10 min at rt.

            "Brook rearrangement-mediated [3 + 4] annulation has evolved as a unique methodology for the construction of not only seven-membered carbocycles but also eight-membered carbo- and oxygen-heterocycles and has been applied to the synthesis of natural products after clarification2 of the precise reaction mechanism accounting for the stereospecificity.\nSynthesis of the Tricyclic Skeleton of Allocyathin B2\nThe synthetic utility of annulation was first demonstrated by the synthesis of the unusual 5-6-7 tricyclic ring skeleton of allocyathin B2, a compound that has been shown to have potent nerve growth factor synthesis-stimulating activity and to be a \u03ba opioid receptor agonist (Scheme 1). The key [3 + 4] annulation proceeded smoothly even with a relatively complex four-carbon unit 1 to afford 2 as a single diastereomer in 50% yield, which was transformed to 3.3\nScheme 1 Synthesis of the tricyclic skeleton of allocyathin B2.\nConstruction of a Tricyclo[5.3.0.01,4]decenone Ring System\nThe use of acryloylsilanes 4 with a leaving group such as a halogen atom at the \u03b2-position as a three-carbon unit in the [3 + 4] annulation afforded tricyclic ketone derivatives 7a,b in yields dependent upon the \u03b2-substituent of 4, in addition to the [3 + 4] annulation-debromosilylation products 9a,b (Scheme 2).4 Small structural changes in the four-carbon unit significantly affect the product distribution. Thus, whereas cyclopentyl methyl ketone enolate gave 7a in almost all cases, 9b was formed as a byproduct in the case of the corresponding cyclohexyl derivative. Mechanistic studies including low-temperature quenching experiments suggested that 7a,b can be formed via an SN'-like intramolecular attack of the enolate at the C-4 position in the intermediate 6a,b, and 9a,b can be formed via tricyclic intermediate 8a,b.\nScheme 2 Construction of a tricyclo[5.3.0.01,4]decenone ring system.\nBF3\u00b7Et2O-Mediated Intramolecular Allylstannane-Ketone Cyclizations\n[3 + 4] annulation using a combination of (Z)-(\u03b2-(tributylstannnyl)acryloyl)silanes 10 and alkenyl methyl ketone enolate 11 proceeded in the same manner to give cycloheptenone derivative 12, which upon treatment with BF3\u00b7Et2O, afforded bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenols 13, an intramolecular addition product of the allylstannane system to the carbonyl group (Scheme 3).5\nScheme 3 BF3\u00b7Et2O-Mediated intramolecular allylstannane-ketone cyclizations.\nStereoselective Construction of Eight-Membered Carbocycles and Oxygen-Heterocycles\nThe use of the enolate 15 (X = CH2) derived from 2-cycloheptenone as the four-carbon unit in [3 + 4] annulation instead of the enolates of alkenyl methyl ketones produced bicyclo[3.3.2]decenone derivatives 16.The two-atom internal tether in these products could be oxidatively cleaved after conversion to \u03b1-hydroxy ketone 17 to give the cis-3,4,8-trisubstituted cyclooctenone enol silyl ethers 18 stereoselectively (Scheme 4).6 This methodology has also been successfully applied to the construction of oxygen eight-membered heterocycles using enolates of 6-oxacyclohept-2-en-1-one 15 (X = O), affording eight-membered oxygen heterocycles 18 (X = O) possessing functionality that can easily be manipulated to generate other functionalized eight-membered ring products.7\nScheme 4 Stereoselective construction of eight-membered carbocycles and oxygen-heterocycles.\nFormal Total Syntheses of (+)-Prelaureatin and (+)-Laurallene\nThe versatility of the annulation has been highlighted through the formal total synthesis of (+)-prelaureatin, a biogenetic precursor of several members of the laurenan structural subclass (Scheme 5).8 The annulation of 19 and sodium enolate 20 proceeded in a highly diastereoselective manner to afford exclusively 21 in 80% yield. The observed excellent selectivity could be explained in terms of the approach of the acryloylsilane from the same side as the C-7 substituent in 20 that is sterically less hindered because of pseudo equatorial disposition of the substituent on the seven-membered ring. The bicyclic derivative 21 was transformed into Crimmins' intermediate 229 after oxidative cleavage of the two-carbon tether.\nScheme 5 Formal total syntheses of (+)-prelaureatin.\nStereocontrolled Construction of Seven- and Eight-Membered Carbocycles Using a Combination of Brook Rearrangement-Mediated [3 + 4] Annulation and Epoxysilane Rearrangement\nThe [3 + 4] annulation has also been expanded to include the construction of densely functionalized seven- and eight-membered carbocycles by combining it with an epoxysilane rearrangement,10 which features a further extension of a stereocontrolled anion relay.11 Reactions of \u03b4-silyl-\u03b3,\u03b4-epoxy-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acylsilane 23 with alkenyl methyl ketone enolate 24 afforded highly functionalized cycloheptenone derivative 28 via a tandem process that involves Brook rearrangement followed by the resulting carbanion-induced ring-opening of the epoxide (25 \u2192 26), a second Brook rearrangement, the formation of divinylcyclopropanediolate derivative 27 via internal carbonyl attack by the resulting carbanion, and an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement (Scheme 6). The reactions using an alternative combination of three and four carbon units (29 + 30), in which an epoxysilane moiety was incorporated in the four-carbon unit, also give satisfactory results, via 1,4-O-to-O silyl migration (31 \u2192 32). Use of enantioenriched acylsilane 33 and 2-cycloheptenone enolate 34 gave a moderate level (62% ee) of asymmetric induction in the bicyclic ketone 35.\nScheme 6 Stereocontrolled construction of seven- and eight-membered carbocycles using a combination of Brook rearrangement-mediated [3 + 4] annulation and epoxysilane rearrangement."

To an oven-dried 500-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is added zinc dust (35 g, 0.54 mol, 9 equiv) and anhydrous acetonitrile (200 mL) (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa (Note 2). To the stirred slurry is added trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL, 13 mmol, 0.2 equiv) and 1,2-dibromoethane (1 mL, 12 mmol, 0.2 equiv). The stirred mixture (Note 3) is heated with a heating mantle to 50-55\u00b0C, held at this temperature for 5 min (Note 4), and then cooled to 25-30\u00b0C using a 20 \u00b0C water bath. Maintaining water bath cooling, 4-bromoanisole (33 g, 0.18 mol, 3 equiv) (Note 5) and cobalt bromide (4.0 g, 18 mmol, 0.3 equiv) (Note 6) are added sequentially. The resulting mixture is stirred for 30 min (Notes (Note 7) and (Note 8)). Maintaining water bath cooling, piperidine (5.36 g, 63 mmol, 1.05 equiv) is added via syringe in one portion followed 2 min later with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (7.45 g, 60 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 9), also added via syringe in one portion. The resulting mixture is stirred for 2 h (Note 10). The mixture is vacuum-filtered through a 110 mL disposable polyethylene fritted funnel (Note 11) into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask, using t-butyl methyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL) to rinse the filter cake. The filtrate is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with a saturated ammonium chloride solution (200 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with t-butyl methyl ether (200 mL). The organic extracts are combined and washed with a saturated ammonium chloride solution (200 mL), then vacuum-filtered through a bed of sodium sulfate (50 g) in a 110 mL disposable polyethylene fritted funnel into a 1-L round-bottomed flask, using t-butyl methyl ether (2 \u00d7 75 mL) to rinse the filter cake. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg), then held under vacuum (20 mmHg) for 24 h at 60 \u00b0C to afford a yellow thick oil containing solids (20-22 g) (Note 12). This material is purified by alumina chromatography, affording product 1 (16-17 g) that contains 5-7 wt % anisole and 10-12 wt % 4,4'-dimethoxybiphenyl (Notes (Note 13)(Note 14)-(Note 15)). The highly crystalline biphenyl impurity is removed by crystallization as follows. To the product in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask is added a 3-cm PTFE coated oval stir bar and hexanes (50 mL). The slurry is stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min and then filtered through a 40-mL polyethylene fritted funnel into a 250-mL flask, rinsing the filter cake with hexanes (2 \u00d7 7 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg), then held under vacuum (20 mmHg) for 24-48 h at 60 \u00b0C (to remove anisole), affording 1-((4-fluorophenyl)(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl)piperidine 1 as a pale yellow oil (13.5-14.1 g, 75-78 % yield) (Notes (Note 16) and (Note 17))."

That condenser was equipped with a line that runs to an HCl trap ((Note 2)). The flask was lowered into an ice water bath and POCl3 (100 mL) was poured into the open neck. The open neck was sealed with a rubber septum. A slight flow of nitrogen gas was introduced into the system through a needle (16 gauge) inserted into one of the side neck septa (Note 3). Stirring was initiated at 300 rpm. Aniline (22.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) was added slowly to the stirring mixture by syringe through a side neck septum over a period of 20 min (Note 4). The flask was then removed from the ice water bath, allowed to stir for 10 min, placed into an oil bath (~110 \u00b0C). and the mixture was stirred for 6 h (Note 5). The flask was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool for 5 min without stirring (Note 6). The mixture was slowly and carefully poured onto crushed ice (~ 1 L) in a 2 L beaker while intermittently stirring with a spatula. The residual material in the 3-neck round-bottomed flask was removed by carefully adding water (100 mL) to the flask and scraping out with a spatula. The aqueous mixture was triturated by vigorous stirring with the spatula (Note 7). The 2 L quench beaker was placed into a bucket of ice. Aqueous NaOH (6 M, 475 mL) was added slowly (over a period of 25 min, maintaining the temperature \u2264 50 \u00b0C) while intermittently stirring (Note 8). The beaker was removed from the ice bath and the suspension was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and age with stirring (77 \u00d7 13 mm stir bar, ~100 rpm) for 12 h (Note 9). The pH of the supernatant was ~7. The suspension was then vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (12.5 cm diameter). Water (150 mL) was used to rinse the residual material from the beaker. The filtered orange-red solid was rinsed with water (150 mL) on the filter. After thoroughly air-drying on the filter (> 1 h), the solid was transferred into 2 cellulose thimbles (43 mm \u00d7 123 mm, int. diam. x ext. length). The contents of each thimble were subjected to a Soxhlet extraction with hexaness (300 mL, (Note 10)) for 16 h. The combined extracts were concentrated (Note 10) by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to leave a yellow solid (13.9\u201314.6 g, 28\u201329%, Notes (Note 11) and (Note 12)) that was used in step B without further purification (Note 13).",

The reaction vessel was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times, then left under a positive pressure of argon.3 Toluene (35 mL) was dispensed into the flask, and the resulting red-brown solution was placed into an oil bath heated to 80 \u00b0C with stirring (Notes (Note 20) and (Note 21), Caution: possible exotherm!). The reaction was monitored by TLC (Note 22); after 1.5 h, nearly complete conversion was observed. The reaction was cooled to 25 \u00b0C, and saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added to the flask. The suspension was stirred for 5 min and cooled to 0 \u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (9 cm diameter) and washed with water (50 mL) and hexaness (150 mL) to afford a light yellow solid. This crude solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 100 mL round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 joint and dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for at least 10 h to leave 4.57-4.80 g of a light beige-yellow solid (73-77%) (Note 23), which was used in step C without further purification.",

The vial was sealed, and this suspension was heated with stirring in the microwave at 170 \u00b0C for 3 min, then at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27), Caution: exothermic!). The reaction mixture was diluted and transferred with 20 mL of dichloromethane to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask for evaporation (Note 28). The reaction was then concentrated by rotary evaporation (80 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg), redissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel, and washed with aqueous NaOH (3 M, 50 mL) and water (4 \u00d7 50 mL). The resulting organic layer was dispensed into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried (MgSO4, 2 g). The solution was filtered (flask and filter were rinsed with an extra 25 mL of dichloromethane) into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h) to provide a light brown powder (Note 29).\nAs much of the material as possible was transferred as a solid from the round-bottomed flask to a pre-weighed 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The remaining solid was dissolved and transferred into a 25-mL pear-shaped flask with 10 mL of dichloromethane and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h). This material was then added to the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The material was dissolved in a 90:10 mixture of acetone and toluene (20 mL/g crude product) with heating in a water bath (70 \u00b0C) (Note 30). The solution was removed from heat and placed on the bench for 1 hour to cool to room temperature. The flask was placed in an ice bath for 3 h or until no further crystallization was observed.

The solution is then filtered through a cotton plug into a 1-L recovery flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) to give the crude product as a colorless oil. The crude oil is dissolved in ~15 mL of DCM and loaded onto a chromatography column (5 \u00d7 17 cm, 120 g silica) (Note 8). After loading, the column is flushed with 400 mL of hexanes. Fraction collecting is started as 1 L of Hex:EtOAc:DCM (100:20:5) is added (flow rate: 20 mL/min, 25 mL fractions) (Note 9 and 10). Fractions containing the pure product (fractions 38-61) are combined and concentrated to yield 22.85-23.24 g (96-97%) of (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl tosylcarbamate as a viscous colorless oil (Note 11).",

A 500-mL, 29/32 necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated oval magnetic stirring bar (50 \u00d7 20 mm) is charged with a solution of (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl tosylcarbamate (3.66 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in 66 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) (Notes (Note 12)(Note 13)(Note 14)-(Note 15)). Diisopropylethylamine (H\u00fcnig's base) (2.25 mL, 1.60 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is then added and the clear solution is allowed to stir for 5 min. Water (66 mL) is added with vigorous stirring, resulting in a biphasic, milky solution (Notes 16 and 17). After stirring for 5 min, gold (I) chloride (AuCl) (150 mg, 0.645 mmol, 0.05 equiv) is added in portions over one minute (Note 18). Upon the addition of AuCl, the milky solution acquires a yellow tint (Note 19). Silver (I) triflate (AgOTf) (166 mg, 0.645 mmol, 0.05 equiv) is then added in one portion resulting in a much whiter solution (Note 20). A reflux condenser (30 \u00d7 3 cm) with a steady cold water flow is affixed, and the flask is then placed into a pre-heated oil bath (85 \u00b0C, bath temp.). The apparatus is then covered up with aluminum foil to minimize the exposure to light. After 1 h, the reaction progressively becomes clearer until the white color dissipates to leave a transparent/grayish solution with some black precipitate. Monitoring by 1H NMR shows the reaction to be nearly complete at 3 h (Note 21). After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture is diluted with 75 mL of DCM, and 75 mL of brine. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with DCM (2 \u00d7 75 mL). The combined organic phase is dried with 10 g of Na2SO4 over 30 min, then concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) to yield the crude product as a grayish/transparent oil. The oil is dissolved in ~5 mL DCM, loaded onto a chromatography column (17 \u00d7 5 cm, 80 g silica), and flushed with 200 mL of hexanes. Fractions were collected as the column is eluted with 1 L of 100:15:5 mixture of Hex:EtOAc:DCM (flow rate: 20 mL/min, 25 mL/fraction). The product is found in fractions 12-30 (Note 22), which are combined and concentrated to afford 2.57 g (83% yield) of N-(1-ethyl-2-propen-1-yl)-4-methyl-benzenesulfonamide as a colorless oil that solidified upon storing neat in the refrigerator (Note 23)."

An oven-dried 500-mL 3-necked round-bottomed flask, an oven-dried Teflon-coated oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (3.8 cm \u00d7 1.6 cm), and an oven-dried 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (fitted in the leftmost neck, capped with a rubber septum) are assembled hot and fitted with rubber septa on the center and right necks. The apparatus is placed under high vacuum (< 1 mmHg) and allowed to cool to room temperature and subsequently maintained under a positive pressure of N2 using needle inlet through the septum on the rightmost neck. Upon cooling, a thermometer is attached to the center neck using a Teflon adapter, and the apparatus is again evacuated under high vacuum. It is then placed under a positive pressure of N2 and charged with 40.0 mL of toluene (Note 1), then cooled in a -15 \u00b0C acetone bath (Note 2). A solution of n-butylmagnesium chloride (16.8 mL, 33.6 mmol, 0.42 equiv., 2.0M in THF) is added (Note 3) and the resulting grey solution is cooled to an internal temperature of -10 \u00b0C (Note 2), at which point 28 mL (67.5 mmol, 0.85 equiv, 2.41 M in hexanes) of n-butyllithium (Note 3) is added via a disposable syringe at such a rate so as to keep the internal temperature below -5 \u00b0C (approximately 30 min addition time) (Note 4). The resulting milky white slurry is stirred at -10 \u00b0C for 30 min (Note 5). During this time the addition funnel is charged with a solution of 25.00 g (79.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) of 1,3,5-tribromobenzene in roughly 130 mL of toluene (Notes (Note 6) and (Note 7)). Dropwise addition is initiated at such a rate that the internal temperature remains below -5 \u00b0C (approximately 45 min addition time).

After addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred at -10 \u00b0C for 2 h (Note 5). At this point all septa are removed to facilitate ventilation of subsequently generated CO2, and the reaction is quenched by addition of 120 mL aqueous solution of 1M citric acid, which causes the internal temperature to rise from -14 \u00b0C to 6 \u00b0C (Note 9). Upon warming to room temperature, the biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated, then washed with an additional 120 mL of 1M aqueous citric acid. The organic phase is dried over MgSO4 (40 g), filtered through a fritted glass funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The residue is further dried under high vacuum to afford a reddish-brown oil that is purified via flash column chromatography on silica gel (675 g, 9-cm diameter column, height of silica gel is 9 inches) to yield 2 as an orange solid (18.99 g, 71%) (Notes (Note 10), (Note 11), and (Note 12)).",

Dichloromethane is added (250 mL, 0.7 M) (Note 3) to dissolve the acid at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). While stirring gently at 150 rpm, anhydrous magnesium sulfate (21.1 g, 175 mmol, 1 equiv) is added to the reaction, followed carefully by red mercury oxide (56.9 g, 263 mmol, 1.5 equiv). A reflux condenser is assembled (Note 4) and capped with a 24/40 rubber septum, through which the reaction is maintained under argon atmosphere (Note 5). The heterogeneous mixture is then stirred at 250-300 rpm and brought to vigorous reflux (oil bath temperature 46 \u00b0C) for 5 to 10 min to ensure freely flowing solids (Note 6).\nSeparately, neat bromine (13.5 mL, 263 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is taken up in a glass-syringe with a needle approximately as long as the reflux condenser (12 inches). The needle is threaded through the rubber septum at the top of the reflux condenser such that bromine will be released near or at the bottom of the condenser (Note 7). Bromine is carefully added dropwise over about 30 min to control the release of CO2 (g).

Neat 3-bromocyclobutenone 1 is added to the amine dropwise over 30 min (17.0 g, 114 mmol, 1 equiv) and settles into a lower layer. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature, and can be stirred for 2 h without adverse effect. No precautions are taken to exclude light or monitor reaction progress by TLC.\nA 100-mL, single-necked, pear-bottomed flask is connected to the reaction flask via a short path distillation head with Vigreux indents (Notes (Note 1) and (Note 15)). This receiving flask is cooled to -78 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, and the reaction flask is placed in an oil bath held constant at 25 \u00b0C. (Figure 2) As the reaction flask is vigorously stirred at 250 rpm, pressure is carefully reduced to 2.5 mmHg and held for 20 min to ensure that cyclobutenone 2 does not foam over too rapidly (Note 16). At this time the receiving flask contains semi-frozen cyclobutenone, which rapidly melts to a clear and faint yellow liquid upon moving the receiving flask to ambient temperature (4.5-4.7 g, 58-60% yield) (Note 17). In this preparation, crude melted cyclobutenone 2 is dissolved in deuterated chloroform for use as a 1M solution (Notes (Note 18) and (Note 19)). If desired, the cyclobutenone 2 can be briefly stored neat at -78 \u00b0C, while the product purity is quickly checked by 1H NMR (Notes (Note 20), (Note 21), and (Note 22)).\nFigure 2.

The suspension is stirred (165 rpm) in an ice bath while pyridine (14.1 mL, 13.8 g, 174 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added dropwise from the dropping funnel over 5 min, such that the internal temperature does not exceed 10 \u00b0C. During the addition, the reaction mixture becomes homogenous and turns yellow. White precipitate is observed within 3 min and the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min (Note 3). n-Hexane (200 mL) and H2O (300 mL) are added and stirred in an ice bath for 15 min. The white precipitates are collected in a medium-porosity sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel (diameter 90 mm) using suction filtration and washed with ice-cooled Et2O (200 mL), and then dried under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 32 mmHg, 3 h). The solid thus obtained is dissolved in boiling acetone (320 mL), and H2O (150 mL) is slowly added (Note 4). The mixture is then cooled in an ice bath for 1 h and the white precipitates are collected by B\u00fcchner funnel (diameter 90 mm) with a medium-porosity fritted disk using suction filtration. The precipitate is washed with ice-cooled Et2O (100 mL) and dried under vacuum over P2O5 (25 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg, 3 h) to give the first crop of N,N'-ditosylhydrazine (2) (35.5 g, 104 mmol, 78%).

The nitrogen adapter is replaced with a vacuum-distillation head connected to a 500-mL round bottom flask immersed in a dry-ice bath. The volatile materials are removed at reduced pressure (60 mmHg) by applying gentle heating to the reaction flask (Note 4). After removal of volatile materials, the reaction flask is back-filled with nitrogen and the brown oil is dissolved by addition of toluene (65 mL) (Note 5). The stirred solution is cooled to -75 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath and 1.1M diethylzinc in toluene (96 mL, 105 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 6) is added by cannula over 10 min, keeping the temperature below -65 \u00b0C.

Using a large plastic funnel, the flask is charged with solid tert-butylhydrazine hydrochloride (25.00 g, 98%, 196.6 mmol) (Note 1) and 2 M NaOH (98.3 mL, 2 M, 196.6 mmol) (Note 2) is added. Stirring is started at ambient temperature. When a complete solution has formed (approx. 10 min), 3-aminocrotononitrile (16.82 g, 96%, 196.6 mmol) (Note 3) is added through the funnel, and the stirring is continued. The funnel is replaced with a thermocouple (Note 4), an air-cooled reflux condenser is fixed to the flask, the third joint is sealed with a glass stopper, and the top of the condenser is connected to an ambient pressure nitrogen line (Note 5). The slurry is then heated to 90 \u00b0C (internal reaction temperature) with vigorous stirring for 22 h. After 22 h, the yellow/orange biphasic mixture is cooled to 57 \u00b0C, the glass stopper removed, and a ~2 mL aliquot of the well-stirred biphasic mixture is removed with a pipette and placed in a 10-mL round-bottomed flask containing a small stir bar (1/2\" \u00d7 1/8\"). The 10 mL flask is then immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath for several minutes until completely frozen. The 10-mL flask is then removed from the bath and allowed to warm up slowly over a magnetic stirplate with the stirring on. As the mass melts, a slurry of seed crystals is formed (Note 6). With the bulk of the reaction being held and stirred vigorously at 57 \u00b0C, the seed slurry is introduced by pouring it through the empty joint into the 250-mL flask in a single portion. Crystallization is evidenced by the formation of large clear globules, and when this is apparent, the heating is turned off and the oil bath is removed. Vigorous stirring is continued, as the mixture cools to ambient temperature, and when the internal temperature is <30 \u00b0C, the slurry is immersed in an ice-water bath for one hour, during which time the tan solids adopt a more granular appearance. A 500-mL filter flask is fitted with a 7 cm porcelain filter funnel containing a paper filter, which is wetted with 2-3 mL of water. The slurry is filtered, and the cold filtrate (Note 7) is used to rinse the flask out and ensure maximum recovery of product (Note 8). The tan solids are allowed to suck dry on the filter for at least 5 min, and then scraped out onto a large piece of filter paper and any chunks are broken up with a spatula. The solids are then transferred into a tared 250-mL beaker, covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at ambient temperature for 3 days (Note 9) to afford a light tan granular solid. The mass of the dried product is 27.0 g that was confirmed to be 97% purity by quantitative NMR. KF of the isolated solids is 3.7%, which affords a corrected yield of 87% (Notes (Note 10), (Note 11), (Note 12), (Note 13) and (Note 14)).",
            "N-(1-tert-Butyl-3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridin-2-amine. To a 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is added 2-chloropyridine (10.00 g, 99%, 87.2 mmol) (Note 15), and the flask is then equipped with an oval magnetic stir bar (3.75 cm \u00d7 0.75 cm), a water-cooled reflux condenser open to the air, an oil bath, a thermocouple (Note 4) and a plastic funnel. To the flask are then added 1 (14.46 g, estimated 97% potency, 91.5 mmol), tetra-butylammonium bromide (1.42 g, 99%, 4.40 mmol) (Note 16), toluene (100 mL) (Note 17) and a commercial solution of NaOH (110 mL, 2 M, 220.2 mmol) (Note 2). The funnel is replaced with a rubber septum, stirring started, and a six inch stainless steel syringe needle connected to a nitrogen source is inserted through the septum and placed below the level of the liquid in order to sparge the solution and headspace with a vigorous stream of nitrogen. Nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min, after which time Pd(dba)2 (0.20 g, 0.35 mmol) and Xantphos (0.31 g, 0.5 mmol) (Notes (Note 18) and (Note 19)) are added as solids by removing the septum rapidly, pouring in the solids, and then quickly replacing the septum. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the mixture for two additional minutes, after which time the top of the condenser is attached to a static-pressure nitrogen source. The mixture is heated to vigorous reflux (internal temperature 87 \u00baC) (Note 20) with stirring for 24 h (Notes (Note 21), (Note 22), and (Note 23)). After 24 h, the oil bath is turned off and removed, and the mixture is cooled to <30 \u00b0C by immersion into a cool water bath. A 500-mL filter flask is equipped with a 7 cm porcelain funnel and a filter paper. The paper is wetted with water, and the solids are isolated by filtration (Note 24). The flask is rinsed with toluene (25 mL) and this is used to rinse the solids on the filter. The solids are washed with water (25 mL) and then EtOH (25 mL) (Note 25) and allowed to suck dry for >5 min. The solids are scraped off the filter paper with a spatula onto a large piece of filter paper and any solids are broken up. The solids are placed in a tared 250-mL beaker and covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at 50 \u00b0C under full house vacuum for 17 h to afford 20.0 g of light yellow/green solids (100%) (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27)).",
            "N-(3-Methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridin-2-amine. A 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is charged with 2 (10.00 g, 43.4 mmol) and equipped with a magnetic stir bar (3.75 cm \u00d7 0.75 cm), oil bath, water-cooled reflux condenser open to the air (Note 28), thermocouple (Note 4), and plastic funnel. Deionized water (100 mL) is added, followed by trifluoroacetic acid (9.9 mL, 99%, 127.0 mmol) (Note 29). The mixture is then heated to 95 \u00b0C, and a clear light green solution is formed, with some dark solids observed floating in the solution. Once the mixture has reached 95 \u00b0C, it is held at that temperature with stirring for three hours. After three hours, the oil bath is turned off and removed, and the solution is cooled to <60 \u00b0C, at which time EtOH (50 mL) is added (Note 25). The solution is then further cooled to <30 \u00b0C using a cool water bath. A second 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with two stoppers and a 4-cm coarse-fritted B\u00fcchner funnel (30 mL volume size) containing dry Celite\u2122 (4.00 g). A few mLs of water is used to wet the Celite\u2122 in order to form a filter pad. The Celite\u2122 filter pad is washed until the filtrate is no longer cloudy and then the collection flask is connected to the funnel. The reaction mixture is carefully filtered through the pad into the second 250 mL flask using gentle vacuum (Note 30). The reaction flask is rinsed with water (10 mL), which is then used to rinse the walls of the filter funnel and filter pad (Note 31). The filter and stoppers are removed, a pH probe is inserted through one of the unused side joints, and a Teflon stir paddle with a glass stir shaft assembly are introduced through the center joint and connected to an overhead stirrer (Note 32). A commercial solution of 5 N NaOH (25 mL) (Note 2) is then added via pipette rapidly at first and more slowly once pH 7 is reached, and the titration is continued until a final pH of 8-10 is reached (Notes (Note 33), (Note 34), (Note 35), and (Note 36)). Upon neutralization, the solution gradually turns cloudy over a few minutes, and crystallization ensues. The slurry is placed in an ice-water bath for one hour with stirring. A 250-mL filter flask is equipped with a 5 cm porcelain funnel and filter paper. The paper is wetted with water (1-2 mL) and the product is isolated by vacuum filtration. To the flask is added water (25 mL) and any residual solids in the flask are rinsed onto the filter cake. After 2-3 minutes on vacuum, the solids are then washed with additional water (25 mL), and then sucked dry for 5 minutes. The solids are scraped onto a large piece of filter paper, broken up with a spatula, placed into a tared 250-mL beaker and covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at 50 \u00b0C under full house vacuum for 15 h to afford the product (g, 6.73 g, 89%) as a pale tan powdery solid (Note 37)."

The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 70 mmHg) and dried for 3 h at ambient temperature (70 mmHg) to give 4-methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, S-[[[(1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)dimethylsilyl]-oxy]methyl] ester (5) as a colorless, viscous oil (9.06 g, 99 %) (Notes 27, 28, and 29)."

            "Nugent's morpholinoisoborneol (MIB) is an excellent ligand for the catalytic asymmetric addition of alkyl, vinyl, and aryl groups to aldehydes in the presence of organozinc reagents to furnish a variety of secondary alcohols with high ee.3,4,5 The major developments have been the significant broadening of the substrate scope and the development of several one-pot methods that streamline the synthesis of synthetically valuable and versatile molecules such as epoxy alcohols, allylic epoxy alcohols, cyclopropyl alcohols, halocyclopropyl alcohols, pyranones and 1,2,4-trioxanes with high enantio-, diastereo-, and chemoselectivity.6,7,8 In this update, we will summarize many of the advances.\nA detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of (-)-MIB has been published in Organic Syntheses.9 Starting from either (R)- or (S)-camphor, gram quantities of either enantiomer of MIB can be synthesized in three steps and with only a single purification step. At the time of this report, only (-)-MIB is commercially available.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Arylation of Aldehydes\nTwo routes for the catalytic asymmetric arylation of aldehydes to generate highly enantioenriched diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were reported (Figure 1).10 In the first route, diarylzinc intermediates were generated in situ by metalation of unfunctionalized aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by transmetalation with ZnCl2 (Figure 1A). The LiCl formed in the process catalyzes a rapid racemic background reaction. The Lewis acidic LiCl was selectively suppressed by addition of tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB and aldehyde to the preformed diarylzinc reagent gave addition products with high enantioselectivities (80-92%) and yields (78-99%). In the second route, mixed alkyl aryl zinc reagents were generated by metalation of aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by addition to ZnCl2 and subsequent addition of a second equivalent of n-BuLi. The mixed organozinc species was used in situ in the asymmetric addition reaction after addition of 0.8 equivalents of TEEDA (Figure 1B). Higher enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were achieved via this route. This methodology was extended to the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl- and diheteroarylmethanols with high levels of enantioselectivity.11\nFigure 1. Catalytic asymmetric aryl additions to aldehydes with (A) Ar2Zn and (B) ArZnBu from aryl bromides.\nCharette and coworkers introduced a complementary catalytic asymmetric arylation method by developing a salt-free preparation of diorganozinc reagents using Zn(OMe)2 and alkyl/aryl Grignard reagents (Figure 2).12 The insoluble salts Mg(OMe)2 and/or NaBr salts were removed by centrifugation or filtration to afford the salt-free diorganozinc reagents. Two examples highlighting the efficiency of this chemistry are illustrated in Figure 2. Ishihara and coworkers adopted Charette's method to synthesize salt-free i-Pr2Zn and subsequently added it to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB with up to 94% ee.13,14\nFigure 2. Charette's catalytic asymmetric (A) alkyl and (B) aryl additions.\n2. Synthesis of Chiral Acyclic Epoxy Alcohols\nIn an effort to streamline the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of valuable small molecules,6 the (-)-MIB-based organozinc catalyzed carbonyl addition step was merged with several other transformations such as epoxidation, cyclopropanation, halocyclopropanation, and various rearrangement reactions. The first tandem reaction developed was for the synthesis of chiral epoxy alcohols.\nFigure 3. Three one-pot synthesis of epoxy alcohols.\nTwo complementary methods were developed for one-pot synthesis of highly enantio- and diastereoenriched epoxy alcohols with up to three contiguous stereocenters.15,16,17 The first route involved highly enantioselective alkyl additions to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes followed by titanium-catalyzed diastereoselective epoxidation with either dioxygen or TBHP (Figure 3A). The second route involves highly enantioselective divinylzinc additions to aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes (Figure 3B). The vinylzinc reagents can be either isolated and purified prior to addition to aldehydes,18,19 or formed in situ by hydroboration of a terminal alkyne followed by transmetalation to zinc (Figure 3C).20 The latter method provided access to a synthetically challenging class of secondary trans-disubstituted epoxy alcohols with up to 4.5 : 1 dr. Excellent enantioselectivities were obtained with a wide range of aldehyde substitution patterns, except unbranched aldehydes, which undergo additions with up to 85% ee. This alkoxide-based titanium epoxidation catalyst is unique in that the same catalyst demonstrated high diastereoselectivity with allylic alkoxides exhibiting either A1,2 or A1,3 allylic strain in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states.\nSynthesis of Chiral Allylic Epoxy Alcohols\nAsymmetric vinylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of MIB generated unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide intermediates. In situ alkoxide directed epoxidation afforded densely functionalized allylic epoxy alcohols in good yields and excellent chemo-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity (Figure 4).16 The vinylzinc reagents may be either prepared and purified (Figure 4A) or generated in situ using Oppolzer's procedure.20\nFigure 4. Synthesis of allylic epoxy alcohols using (A) purified vinylzinc reagents, or (B) in situ generated vinylzinc reagents.\nThe latter procedure afforded only (E)-disubstituted vinylzinc reagents whereas the former allowed for more substituted vinylzinc reagents. The enal must bear non-hydrogen substituents in the R2 or R3 position so that either A1,2 or A1,3 strain is present in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states. The unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide then underwent a highly chemoselective directed epoxidation of the more electron-rich double bond while minimizing A1,2 or A1,3 strain.\nCatalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes\nThe vinylation procedures above provide (E)-allylic alcohols. Walsh and coworkers developed catalytic asymmetric (Z)-vinylation of aldehydes with (Z)-vinylzinc reagents via a novel 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence.21,22 Thus, hydroboration of 1-halo-1-alkynes followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium,23 transmetalation of the resulting (Z)-vinylboranes to zinc and addition to prochiral aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB and the diamine inhibitor TEEDA furnished (Z)-disubstituted allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity and without contamination by (E)-allylic alcohols (Scheme 1). This transformation is analogous to a net trans hydroboration of the corresponding alkynes. Aliphatic aldehydes with \u03b1-branching gave products of high enantiopurity whereas \u03b2-branched aldehydes gave lower enantioselectivities.\nScheme 1. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (Z)-allylic alcohols.\n4.1 Tandem Catalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes/Diastereoselective Epoxidation and Cyclopropanation\nThe generation and addition of (Z)-vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes were then applied to two one-pot tandem reactions. In the first tandem reaction, the resulting allylic alkoxides were treated with Et2Zn, TBHP, and Ti(Oi-Pr)4 to perform the diastereoselective and/or chemoselective epoxidation to synthesize epoxy alcohols and (Z)-allylic epoxy alcohols (Figure 5A).21 In the second tandem reaction, the allylic alkoxides were subjected to 5 equiv each of CF3CH2OH, Et2Zn, and CH2I2 to provide highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols (Figure 5B).24 A variety of 1-chloro-1-alkynes and aldehydes (saturated, aromatic, and heteroaromatic) were employed successfully in these tandem reactions.\nFigure 5. Tandem syntheses of (A) epoxy and allylic epoxy alcohols and (B) syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols.\n4.2 Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis (Z)-Trisubstituted Allylic Alcohols\nThe (Z)-vinyl zinc reagents generated were all disubstituted because the 1,2-metalate rearrangement was executed with a hydride source. A variant of the 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence for the stereospecific generation of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents was also developed.25 Hydroboration of 1-bromo-1-hexyne with either diethyl- or dicyclohexylborane followed by 3 equiv of diethylzinc provided the (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents. The dialkylzinc served a two-fold function: it induced a 1,2-metalate shift to form the new C-C bond and promoted the boron to zinc transmetallation. In the presence of TMEDA (to inhibit the zinc halide by-product) and catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB, these reagents were then employed in the catalytic asymmetric addition of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish enantioenriched (Z)-trisubsituted allylic alcohols in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, this procedure could not be adapted to the highly enantioselective synthesis of \u03b1-methyl-substituted allylic alcohols despite screening several additives (ee <30%, 15-50% yield).\nScheme 2. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1-ethyl and \u03b1-cyclohexyl (Z)-trisubstituted allylic alcohols.\nTandem Catalytic Asymmetric Addition/Diastereoselective Cyclopropanation\n5.1. Synthesis of syn-Cyclopropyl Alcohols. Two tandem routes have been developed to synthesize highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.26 The first route involved enantioselective alkyl addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB (Figure 6A) whereas the second route involved addition of vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish the allylic alkoxide intermediates (Figure 6B). After removal of the volatile materials, the intermediate allylic alkoxide was exposed to either EtZnCH2I or the more reactive CF3CH2OZnCH2I27 to furnish syn-cyclopropyl alcohols with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The first route has a broader substrate scope, but is more challenging because unsaturated aldehydes isomerize readily. The second route provides only (E)-disubstituted syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.\nFigure 6. Tandem asymmetric A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation and B) vinylation of aldehydes followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.2. Synthesis of Enantioenriched Dienols and syn-Vinylcyclopropanes\nThe catalytic enantioselective vinylation was extended to addition of dienyl groups to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB.24 The requisite dienyl zinc intermediates were synthesized via chemo- and regioselective hydroboration of enynes followed by transmetallation with diethylzinc. Dienols were obtained in 79-93% yield and 76-94% ee (Figure 7A).\nThis methodology was further extended to the synthesis of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The dienylzinc alkoxide intermediates were subjected to EtZnCH2I to provide vinyl cyclopropanes with high chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Figure 7B). The alkoxide directed cyclopropanation of allylic C=C bonds is faster than remote C=C bonds.28 A limitation of this method is that aromatic aldehydes were unsuccessful coupling partners.\nFigure 7. Asymmetric dienylation and diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.3. Synthesis of anti-Cyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe inherent bias for syn-selectivity in the alkoxide directed cyclopropanation could be switched to synthesize anti-cyclopropyl alcohols using a strategy developed by Charette and coworkers29 wherein allylic alcohols were protected with bulky silyl groups to prevent coordination to zinc carbenoids. In our method for the synthesis of anti-cyclopropanes,19 we silylated the intermediate zinc alkoxide in situ with TMSCl/Et3N and then subjected the silyl ether to cyclopropanation conditions. The cyclopropyl zinc alkoxides were desilylated in situ to furnish anti-cyclopropyl alcohols in 60-82% yield with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3). The Et3N is likely necessary to break up the zinc aggregates, rendering the zinc alkoxides more nucleophilic towards TMSCl.\nScheme 3. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of anti-cyclopropyl alcohols.\n5.4. Synthesis of syn-Halocyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe catalytic enantio- and diastereoselective tandem generation of cyclopropyl alcohols was extended to the synthesis of halo-substituted cyclopropyl alcohols.26,30 The enantioenriched zinc alkoxide intermediate was subjected to Et2Zn, CF3CH2OH, and either iodoform, bromoform or dichlorobromomethane to furnish iodo-, bromo- or chlorocyclopropyl alcohols respectively in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Figure 8A). In these one-pot tandem halocyclopropanation reactions, four consecutive stereogenic centers are established with excellent diastereoselectivity starting from simple achiral \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde precursors. Interrogation of the cyclopropyl stereochemistry via 1H NMR and X-ray analyses led to an interesting find; when R4 = alkyl or H, the halo group was cis to the carbinol, whereas when R4 = Ph, the halo group was trans. This switch in stereochemical bias was rationalized by invoking a zinc-phenyl-p interaction.31\nA complementary approach to iodocyclopropyl alcohols was developed using MIB-catalyzed asymmetric vinyl addition as the first step followed by subjection of the zinc alkoxide intermediate to 3 equiv of Zn(CHI2)2 (Figure 8B).30 The iodocyclopropyl alcohols can be further allylated with allyl/methallyl bromide in the presence of LiCu(n-Bu)2 to furnish 1,2,3-disubstituted cyclopropanes in good yields as single diastereomers with full retention of the cyclopropane stereochemistry (not shown).\nFigure 8. Tandem asymmetric (A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective halocyclopropanations and (B) vinyl addition to aldehydes followed by diastereoselective iodocyclopropanation.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Aminovinylation of Aldehydes: Synthesis of \u03b2-Hydroxyenamines, \u03b2-Aminoalcohols, and syn-Aminocyclopropyl Alcohols\nRegioselective hydroboration of ynamides followed by boron to zinc transmetallation and subsequent addition to aldehydes in the presence of 5 mol % (-)-MIB furnished \u03b2-hydroxyenamines in moderate yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee, Figure 9A).32\nA tandem catalytic asymmetric aminovinylation/diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction was developed to synthesize syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols with excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1) in moderate yields (Figure 9B).32\nFigure 9. A) Synthesis of \u03b2-hydroxyenamines and B) tandem synthesis of syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Ethoxyvinylation of Aldehydes\nHighly enantioselective addition of ethoxyvinyl zinc reagents, generated via hydroboration of ethoxyacetylene followed by in situ transmetalation to zinc and addition to aldehydes in presence of MIB afforded hydroxyenol ethers with high ee (89-95%) and yields (>93%, Scheme 4).33 Subsequent hydrolysis generated two carbon homologated enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes. In the case of addition to chiral \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes, mismatched and matched catalyst-substrate combinations can be used to achieve moderate to good diastereoselectivities of either the syn- (up to 3.8:1 with (-)-MIB) or anti-diols (>9:1 with (+)-MIB).\nScheme 4. One-pot tandem catalytic asymmetric ethoxyvinylation of aldehydes.\nOther uses of MIB in Organic Synthesis\n8.1. Synthesis of \u03b3Unsaturated \u03b2-Amino Acid Derivatives\nA catalytic enantioselective synthesis of \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives was achieved in three steps from trityl protected 1-butyne-3-ol.34 The enantioenriched allylic alcohols were transformed into the corresponding allylic amines via a [3,3]-sigmatropic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, and led to \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives with high ee after a one-pot deprotection-oxidation sequence (Scheme 5). Similar [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions were executed to access enantioenriched allylic amines en route to the syntheses of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (Figure 10).35,36\nScheme 5. Asymmetric synthesis of \u03b3unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\nFigure 10. [3,3]-Sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions en route to the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D.\n8.2. Synthesis of Di(allyl) Ether Derivatives\nNelson and coworkers added Et2Zn to conjugated enals in the presence of MIB followed by O-allylation of the enantioenriched zinc alkoxides to provide di(allyl) ethers in good yields (73-87%) and high ee (88-98%).37,38,39 Subsequent olefin isomerization and Claisen rearrangement provided access to a variety of enantio- and diastereoenriched Claisen adducts (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6. Asymmetric synthesis of di(allyl) derivatives.\n8.3. One-pot Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyranones\nEnantioenriched pyranones with >90% ee were prepared via a one-pot tandem asymmetric alkylation of 2-furfurals in the presence of catalytic (-)-MIB followed by oxidation with NBS (Scheme 7).40\nScheme 7. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched pyranones.\n8.4. Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched 1,2,4- Trioxanes\nEnantioenriched allylic alcohols can be subjected to a hydroxyl directed regio- and diastereoselective photooxygenation reaction with O2 in the presence of tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) to obtain allylic hydroperoxides in >10:1 dr, with the threo-isomer as the major product (Scheme 8).41 The allylic hydroperoxides were further reacted with cyclic ketones in the presence of catalytic p-TsOH to yield enantioenriched 1,2,4-trioxanes (16-78% yield) that exhibited antimalarial activity.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroperoxy alcohols and 1,2,4-trioxanes.\n8.5. Polystyrene-supported MIB-derived Ligands\nPericas and coworkers have successfully synthesized and immobilized 3-exopiperazinoisoborneol (PIB), a close analog of MIB, to Merrifield resins (Scheme 9).42 Polystyrene-supported PIB possessed high catalytic activity and improved chemical stability, and was employed as a ligand (10 mol %) in the asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes with Et2Zn in batch methods to produce highly enantioenriched alcohols in good yields (50-92% y, 92-99% ee). This method is amenable to continuous flow methods for over 30 h with high conversion and no erosion in enantioselectivity. In this fashion, industrial scale amounts (13.0 g) of enantiopure alcohol were isolated in a single continuous flow operation leading to >30 fold better performance compared to batch conditions (TON = 251 with respect to the product).\nScheme 9. Synthesis of polystyrene-supported PIB\n8.6. MIB in Syntheses of Natural Products\nOver the years, MIB has been employed in the synthesis of a number of natural products. In all of these syntheses, MIB has been primarily used in asymmetric alkylation or vinylation reactions to provide diastereo- and enantioenriched alcohols.35,36,41,43,44 In their formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A, Hong and coworkers employed (-)-MIB in the diastereoselective vinylation of a chiral aldehyde to furnish the requisite allylic alcohol with >32:1 diastereoselectivity (Figure 11).44 The enantio- and diastereoselective addition step can be further coupled with efficient transformations en route to synthesis of natural products. As outlined earlier, a [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reaction was employed in the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (jaspine B) (Figure 10)35,36 while a diastereoselective Schenk ene reaction with singlet oxygen was utilized in the synthesis of artemisin-type 1,2,4-trioxanes (Scheme 8).41 It is hopeful that synthetic chemists will adopt the tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations reactions presented herein in efficient synthesis of their natural products.\nFigure 11. Hong and coworkers diastereoselective vinyl carbonyl addition in the formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A.\nBoth Nugent's (+)- and (-)-MIB have found significant synthetic utility as a ligand of choice for addition of organozinc groups to carbonyl compounds. The efficient installation of chirality, coupled with tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations, provides high-value added building blocks that augment the synthetic organic chemist's repertoire of enantioenriched small molecules."

Subsequently a solution of 3-t-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (558 mg, 3.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dichloromethane (15 mL) (Note 2) is added in one portion and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 19 h (Note 4). The dark yellow solution is concentrated in the reaction flask by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C water bath, 150 mmHg) and the residue, containing the imines (Note 5), is dissolved in methanol (45 mL) (Note 2). A magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 2 \u00d7 1 cm) and an excess of sodium borohydride (768 mg, 19.9 mmol, 6.6 equiv) (Note 2) is added in small portions over 5 min. Because of the slightly exothermic reaction the reflux condenser is attached, and the solution is stirred for 2 h at ambient temperature (Notes 6 and 7). The reaction is quenched with 1N HCl (3 mL) and after stirring for 5 min 4N NaOH (9 mL) is added and the mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel containing 90 mL of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. After the first portion of ethyl acetate (75 mL) is added to the dichloromethane solution, the phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 75 mL). The combined organic phase is washed with distilled water (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (4 g), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C water bath, 38 mmHg) to afford a pale yellow oil (Note 7), which is chromatographed on silica gel (Note 8). Fractions containing the product were collected, concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C water bath, 75 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) to obtain ligand 2 (579-582 mg, 1.58 mmol, 52-53% yield, > 99% ee) as a white solid (Notes 9, 10 and 11).",

A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 2 \u00d7 1 cm) is charged with 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-[[[(1R,2R)-2-[(4-pyridinylmethyl)-amino]cyclohexyl]amino]methyl]-phenol (2, 606 mg, 1.65 mmol, 5.7 mol%) (Note 12), copper acetate (273 mg, 1.47 mmol, 5.1 mol%) and 30 mL of ethanol (Note 12). Within minutes the reaction mixture becomes deep green. After stirring for 45 min at 23 \u00b0C to complete the formation of the Cu(II) complex 3,2 solid p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4.48 g, 29.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and nitromethane (16.2 mL, 18.3 g, 295 mmol, 10 equiv) (Note 13) are added. Stirring is continued for an additional 3 h (Note 14). The deep green solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 \u00b0C water bath, 24 mmHg) to give 8.01 g of a dark green solid (92% ee) (Note 15). The residue is dissolved in 4.4 mL of methanol (Note 13) and immediately purified by column chromatography (Note 16). Fractions containing the product are combined in a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 \u00b0C water bath, 24 mmHg) and dissolved in a minimal amount of methanol (4.4 mL, dissolution aided by use of ultrasound). To facilitate the crystallization the flask is placed in a refrigerator (3 \u00b0C, 5 h) and freezer (-20 \u00b0C, 12 h). The mother liquor is removed with a pasteur pipette and the yellowish crystals are washed with cold dichloromethane (taken from the freezer; 3 \u00d7 0.5 mL), which is removed each time with a Pasteur pipette, and dried (23 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) to provide product 4 (4.24 g, 69% yield, 95% ee). The mother liquor is concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 \u00b0C water bath, 8 mmHg), layered with dichloromethane (ca. 0.5 mL) and cooled (3 \u00b0C, 2 h then -20 \u00b0C, 24 h). The mother liquor is removed with a pasteur pipette and the yellowish crystals are washed with cold dichloromethane (taken from the freezer; 3 \u00d7 0.5 mL), which is again removed each time with a Pasteur pipette, and dried (23 \u00b0C, 0.2 mmHg) to give a second crop of yellow crystals (0.77 g, 12% yield, 94% ee). The two crops were combined to provide (1S)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-nitroethane-1-ol (4) (5.01 g, 81% yield, 95% ee) (Notes 15, 17, 18 and 19)."

A 1000-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 7 cm magnetic stir bar, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter, and an ice-water bath, is charged with 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone (50.0 g, 251 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 1), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (37.0 g, 532 mmol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 2) and denatured ethanol (375 mL) (Note 3). Pyridine (37.5 mL, 465 mmol, 1.85 equiv) (Note 4) is charged through the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to the suspension over 5 min. Once the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The ice-water bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 4 h (Note 5). After this period, the flask is removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-water bath until the internal temperature cools to approximately 20 \u00b0C Temperature of the mixture was determined by addition of a thermometer to the flask after approximately 10 min of cooling. The magnetic stir bar is removed and the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 \u00b0C, 35-40 mmHg) to remove ethanol and other volatiles (~370 mL) to provide a solid residue. The flask is equipped with 7 cm magnetic stir bar and a 500-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel. Water (375 mL) is charged to the mixture through the dropping funnel over 15 min. The resulting slurry is stirred at room temperature for 1 h, then vacuum-filtered on a 9-cm B\u00fcchner funnel (fitted with Whatman-1 filter paper, 90 mm), washed with water (2 x 25 mL) and suction dried (approx. 10 min). The solid is transferred to a 250-mL beaker and dried under vacuum (~130 mmHg) at 65 \u00b0C for 12 h to afford the title compound 1 as a white solid (53.0-53.1 g, 99%) (Note 6).",

The resulting solution is sparged with nitrogen for 20 min (Note 10) and then iron(II) acetate (32.5 g, 187 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 11) is charged in one portion. The resulting brown slurry is heated to approximately 65 \u00b0C with a heating mantle and stirred for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 12). The heating mantle is then replaced with an ice-water bath and the resulting mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of approximately 5 \u00b0C. To this solution is charged ethyl acetate (100 mL) (Note 13) and then water (200 mL) slowly over 10 min while keeping the internal temperature below 20 \u00b0C (Note 14). The pH of the solution is adjusted to ~5 by the addition of 25 mL of 15 wt% aqueous NaOH solution (Note 15). The contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The bottom aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (125 mL). The combined organic layers are washed sequentially with 1 N aqueous NaOH solution (120 mL) followed by 8 wt% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (150 mL) (Notes 16 and 17). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (5 g) (Note 18) and filtered. The filtrate is transferred into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 25 mmHg) to dryness (Note 19). To the residue is charged ethyl acetate (10 mL) followed by hexanes (95 mL) using a 250 mL addition funnel over a period of 30 min while stirring with a 7 cm magnetic stir bar.

The flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (6 \u00d7 15 mm) and a reflux condenser, which is sealed with a rubber septum. Argon is introduced by means of a syringe needle through the septum and the system is flushed with argon for 5 min before the flask is immersed in an oil-bath at 125 \u00b0C (Note 5). The reaction mixture is refluxed for 18 h under an atmosphere of argon (Note 6). The solution stays clear and colorless for the duration of the reaction. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is transferred to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 25 mmHg). The resulting oil is azeotroped twice by adding hot toluene (2 x 50 mL) and concentrating by rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C, 25 mmHg) (Note 7). The crude white solid (6.36-6.42 g) is transferred to a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 18 mL of near-boiling 1,2-dichloroethane (80 \u00b0C). The resulting solution is left to cool to ambient temperature over 2 h, allowing crystallization to occur, and is further cooled at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and suction-dried for 30 min. The crystals are rinsed with 5 mL of ice-cold hexanes, suction-dried again for 30 min, transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask and dried for 1 h at 0.1 mmHg at ambient temperature to provide E-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethanone oxime as white needle crystals (5.27-5.42 g, 83-86% yield) (Notes 8 and 9)."

            "Reductive coupling reactions are among the most useful strategies for the efficient synthesis of complicated molecules and physiologically active molecules.2 We reported for the first time that Ni-catalysts are able to promote the homoallylation of aldehydes with a wide variety of 1,3-dienes in the presence of triethylborane or diethylzinc to yield bishomoallyl alcohols with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities.3 Based on these procedures, the scope of reductive coupling reactions have been significantly expanded in recent years. Herein, the scope of the homoallylation of aldehydes and ketones with conjugated dienes, asymmetric homoallylations of carbonyls, synthesis of natural products involving Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling, and bis-metallic homoallylations are summarized.\nScope of Homoallylation of Carbonyls with Various Conjugated Dienes\nThe results of the Ni-catalyzed homoallylation of benzaldehyde with conjugated dienes bearing electron-donating substituents, such as siloxy and alkoxy groups, were described (Table 1).4 C1- and C2-siloxy-1,3-butadienes reacted with benzaldehyde highly regio- and stereoselectively and furnished homoallyation products as a single isomer in good to excellent yields. A siloxy group surpasses a methyl group in regiocontrolling effect; a substituted 1,3-butadiene possessing a siloxy group at C2 and a methyl group at C3 reacted with benzaldehyde via the C1 carbon atom to afford 4-methyl-3-siloxy-4-penten-1-ol exclusively (entry 2, Table 1). While a C2-siloxy group enhanced the reactivity of butadiene at the C1 position, a C1-siloxy group induced reactivity at the C4 position exclusively (entries 3-5, Table 1). The present homoallylation with siloxy and methoxy-substituted butadienes is of great synthetic value as synthetic equivalents of functionalized butenyl carbanion and not as silyl enol ethers.\nTable 1. Ni-Catalyzed Homoallylation of Aldehydes with Conjugated Diene\nCyclohexadiene failed to react with benzaldehyde using the Ni/Et3B system, whereas the Ni/Et2Zn system accelerated the reaction (Figure 1). However, the major product was syn-1-(2-cyclohexenyl)-1-phenylmethanol, which was obtained by nucleophilic allylation of benzaldehyde with 2-cyclohexenyl benzoate through umpolung of \u03c0-allylpalladium.5\nFigure 1. Ni-Catalyzed Allylation of PhCHO with 1,3-Cyclohexadiene\nAsymmetric reductive coupling of dienes and aldehydes was also reported. When Ni-catalyzed homoallylation of aldehydes with 1,3-dienes was performed with bulky spirobiindane phosphoramidite ligands and diethylzinc as a reducing agent, chiral bishomoallyl alcohols were produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities (Figure 2).6\nFigure 2. Asymmetric Ni-Catalyzed Homoallylation of Aldehydes\nFigure 3. Formal Synthesis of C1-C9 Fragment of Amphidinolide C\nNi-catalyzed homoallylation of aldehydes with isoprene served as an important synthetic strategy for the construction of the tetrahydrofuran fragment from amphidinolide C (Figure 3).7 Homoallylation of erythrolactol followed by cross metathesis of the hydroxyl alkene with methyl acrylate afforded \u03c9-hydroxy \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters, which underwent cyclization upon treatment with DBU to produce tetrahydrofurans with the correct relative configuration for the C1-C9 fragment of amphidinolide C.\nBismetallative Homoallylation of Aldehydes with Dienes\nNickel-catalyzed borylative coupling reactions of diene and aldehyde were studied. In the presence of Ni catalyst, phosphine ligand, and bis(pinacolato)diboron, benzaldehyde reacted with 1,3-dienes, followed by oxidative hydrolysis with hydrogen peroxide, to provide 4-pentene-1,3-diols and 2-pentene-1,5-diols (Figure 4).8 In this case, bis(pinacolato)diboron participated in the \u03c3-bond metathesis providing access to allyl boronic esters. Their selectivity depends on the kind of phosphine ligands. Homoallylation products were observed exclusively using the P(SiMe3)3 ligand, whereas P(t-Bu)3 provided allylation products. This borylative carbonyl-diene coupling reaction could be extended to the reaction of ketones, which afforded to afford bis-bishomoallyl alcohols using Ni(cod)2/P(t-Bu)3 as catalyst, in contrast to the allylation product regioselectivities obtained with aldehydes.\nFigure 4. Borylative Coupling Reaction of Diene and Carbonyls\nNi-catalyzed silylborative coupling reactions with aldehydes and 1,3-dienes gave the corresponding bishomoallyl alcohols having an allylsilane unit in the side chain (Figure 5).9 This procedure was applied to the synthetic approach to optically active \u03b1-chiral allylsilane derivatives.\nFigure 5. Borylative Coupling Reaction of Diene and Carbonyls\nTransition Metal Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Aldehydes with Dienes Promoted by Triethylborane\nTransition metal catalyzed C-C bond formations involving conjugated dienes and carbonyls have been developed. When a mixture of 1,3-diene and aldehyde is used in the presence of triethylborane, the reaction changes dramatically depending on the kind of transition metal catalysts. Rh(I) catalysts promote the reductive coupling reaction of a wide variety of aldehydes with conjugated dienes in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of triethylborane to provide homoallyl alcohols in good yields (Figure 6).10 Isoprene reacts with benzaldehyde at the C3- and C2-positions to give a regioisomeric mixture of 3-butenyl alcohols in a 6:1 ratio. Methyl sorbate reacts with aldehydes at the \u03b1-carbon position with excellent stereoselectivity producing the (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol framework as a single isomer. The similar coupling reactions of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes were observed by employment of Ru and Ir catalysts using isopropyl alcohol and formic acid as reducing agents (Figure 7).11\nFigure 6. Rh(I) Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Aldehydes and Dienes\nFigure 7. Ru-Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Aldehydes and Dienes\nA combination of Pd-catalyst/Xantphos and triethylborane promoted the ene-type reaction of aldehydes and conjugated dienes to afford dienyl homoallyl alcohols in excellent yields (Figure 8).12 Methyl sorbate underwent formal Baylis-Hillman type C-C bond formation at the \u03b1-position to provide (2E,4E)-hexadien-1-ol with excellent stereoselectivity.\nFigure 8. Pd/Xantphos Promoted Coupling Reaction of Aldehydes and Conjugated Dienes Promoted by Triethylborane\nThus, the combination of transition metal catalyst and triethylborane nicely promoted the coupling reaction of carbonyls and conjugated dienes to furnish the stereodefined bishomoallyl and homoallyl alcohols. The reductive coupling reactions offer great efficiency and a useful strategy for the synthesis of important physiologically active molecules, such as terpene alcohols and macrolides."

The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, into which is inserted a syringe needle attached to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen 3 times. Anhydrous acetonitrile (50 mL) (Note 4) and chloromethyl phenyl sulfide (10.2 mL, 12.10 g, 76.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added successively to the flask by syringe. A reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adaptor is quickly attached and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen three times. The stirred reaction mixture is heated to reflux in an oil bath (102-103 \u00b0C, bath temp) for 120 h (Note 6). The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice bath (0 \u00b0C, bath temp) (Note 7), diluted with ice water (50 mL) (Note 8), and transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. The mixture is extracted with methylene chloride (4 x 25 mL, Note 9) (Note 10). The combined organic layer is washed with water (30 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 10 g, 15 min) (Note 11), and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) to give crude fluoromethyl phenyl sulfide as a brownish oil (10.04-10.25 g, 93-95%) that is directly subjected to oxidation. To a 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (50 x 8 mm, octagonal) (Note 12) is added Oxone\u00ae (116.80 g, 190 mmol KHSO5, 2.6 equiv) (Note 13) and distilled water (175 mL). The flask is capped loosely with a septum and placed in an ice bath. The septum is replaced with an addition funnel and a solution of crude fluoromethyl phenyl sulfide (10.20 g, 72 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in methanol (175 mL) (Note 14) is added dropwise over ca. 1 h (Note 15). The reaction mixture is allowed to slowly warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 h. Methanol is removed via rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) (Note 16). The resulting residue contains a large amount of insoluble white precipitate, which is removed by filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 17). The funnel is rinsed with methylene chloride (2 x 30 mL) and the filtrate is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. After layer separation, the aqueous layer is further extracted with methylene chloride (Note 18) (5 \u00d7 30 mL, Note 9). The organic layers are combined, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 10 g, 15 min) (Note 11), filtered, and concentrated to ca. 40 mL of a pale yellow solution. The solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (230-400 mesh, 100 mL), which is further washed with methylene chloride (ca. 250 mL, Note 9) to give a clear solution (Note 19). The filtrate is concentrated via rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 2 mmHg) and then placed under vacuum (room temperature, ca. 0.2-0.3 mmHg, 15-30 min) to result in a clear or slightly yellowish oil, which slowly solidifies at room temperature under vacuum. The solid is stirred with hot hexanes (ca. 50 mL, 60~65 \u00b0C) (Note 20) for 20 min, which forms two layers. Upon cooling to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath, the bottom layer gradually crystallizes to yield colorless crystals over 15 min, which are collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) hexanes (2 x 10 mL) (Note 21) to afford fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (1) (10.99-12.18 g, 83-92%) (Note 22).",
            "B. a-Fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) (2). An oven-dried (140 \u00b0C, 12 h) 250-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar (25 x 8 mm, octagonal), is charged with potassium hydride (21.80 g, 30% wt in oil, 163 mmol, 2.7 equiv) (Note 23), sealed with a rubber septum and connected through a syringe needle to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times and then placed in an ice bath. Excess oil is removed as follows. Anhydrous hexanes (20 mL) (Note 24) are added to the flask via syringe. The mixture is gently stirred for 10 min and allowed to stand unstirred for another 10 min before the removal of the hexanes-oil solution with a syringe. The hexanes-oil solution is added dropwise to an isopropyl alcohol solution. This washing procedure is repeated two more times. Anhydrous THF (130 mL) is then added (Note 25). Hexamethyldisilazane (40.9 mL, 31.5 g, 195 mmol, 3.2 equiv) (Note 26) is then added portion-wise to the stirred solution via syringe over a period of 20-30 min. The hydrogen evolution ceases within 15 min after the addition. The ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand without stirring for 30 min at room temperature before use (Note 27). An oven dried (140 \u00b0C, 12 h) 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (37.5 x 8 mm, octagonal) is charged with fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (1) (10.66 g, 61.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and connected through a syringe needle to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times. Benzenesulfonyl fluoride (7.37 mL, 9.80 g, 61.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 28) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 25) are added successively via syringe. The flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (-78 \u00b0C) and the stirred contents are treated with the KHMDS solution in tetrahydrofuran prepared above (Note 29), which is added dropwise via cannula (Note 30) over 30 min. During the course of the addition, the reaction mixture becomes brownish, cloudy, and viscous. After 30 min at -78 \u00b0C, the reaction mixture is quenched by transfer via cannula over 30 min to another 500-mL round-bottomed flask maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere containing a stirred solution of 4M HCl (185 mL) (Note 31). The resultant mixture appears as a single opaque layer and is extracted with methylene chloride in a 500 mL separatory funnel (5 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with brine (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 15 g, 15 min) (Note 11), and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated via rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (room temperature, ca. 0.2-0.3 mmHg) to afford crude a-fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (2) as a colorless solid (18.28 g, 95%). Examination by 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectroscopy shows the crude product (2) to be satisfactory for most preparative purposes (>98% purity) (Note 32). Compound 2 can be further purified by recrystallization in methylene chloride and hexanes as follows. The crude product is placed in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. Methylene chloride (35 mL) is added and the mixture is heated to reflux to dissolve the product. Hexanes (ca. 30 mL) are slowly added portion-wise through the top of the condenser, while maintaining the reflux. The solution is slowly cooled to room temperature. The solution is then transferred to a refrigerator set to 5 \u00b0C and held for 2 h. The resulting white precipitate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, rinsed with 25 mL cold methylene chloride/hexanes (1:1, v/v; 0 \u00b0C) and allowed to air dry on the funnel for 15 min and then placed on a vacuum line for 15 min (rt, 0.2-0.3 mmHg) to render 14.04 g of 2. The mother liquor is further concentrated to approximately one-half volume. An additional 20 mL of cold hexanes (0 \u00b0C) is then added causing the solution to become cloudy. After 15 minutes without stirring an additional 2.51 g of FBSM is isolated by the above mentioned procedure (combined yield 16.55 g, 85%) (Notes 32 and 33)."

            "Prior and subsequent to our original report in Organic Syntheses, we have described a number of highly diastereoselective Lewis acid-mediated additions of titanium enolates from chiral N-acyl thiazolidinethiones to acetals.2 These involve the addition of N-propanoyl and N-acetyl-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione to dialkyl acetals (eq 1 and 2 in Scheme 1)3-5 and dimethyl ketals from methyl ketones (eq 3 in Scheme 1).6 Furthermore, the scope of the acyl groups has been recently expanded to N-glycolyl derivatives. Especially, O-pivaloyl protected N-glycolyl 4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione undergoes highly diastereoselective additions to a wide array of dimethyl and dibenzyl acetals (eq 4 in Scheme 1).7\nScheme 1. Stereoselective additions of titanium enolates from N-acyl-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione to dialkyl acetals and ketals\nThese reactions likely proceed through a mechanism in which an oxocarbenium intermediate approaches to the less hindered face of the titanium enolate. Taking advantage of such a picture, this chemistry has been successfully applied to glycals. Thereby, activation of glycals by Lewis acids triggers the formation of cyclic and conjugated oxocarbenium intermediates that may participate in highly diastereoselective \u03b1- and \u03b2-C-glycosidation processes with the abovementioned titanium enolates. Importantly, the appropriate choice of the chiral auxiliary and the C6-protecting group determines the stereochemical outcome of these carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and permits the modular preparation of three of the four possible diastereomers of \u03b1- or \u03b2-1'-methyl-substituted C-glycosides (Scheme 2).8-10\nScheme 2. Stereoselective C-glycosidation reactions\nSynthetic applications\nThese methods have been already applied to the synthesis of natural products. For instance, our group took advantage of the Lewis acid-mediated addition of the titanium enolates from (S) N-acetyl and N-propanoyl 4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thiones (1 and 2 respectively in Scheme 3) to dialkyl acetals for the construction of the C9-C21 fragment of debromoaplysiatoxin.11 As shown in Scheme 3, chromatographic purification of the product formed from the reaction between 1 and the dimethyl acetal of an aromatic aldehyde afforded diastereomerically pure adduct 3 in 82% yield. Removal of the chiral auxiliary gave alcohol 4, which was further elaborated to chiral dibenzyl acetal 5. Then, the stage was set for the introduction of two new stereocenters. Indeed, the asymmetric induction imparted by the titanium enolate of 2 and the Felkin bias of the oxocarbenium cation from 5 provided adduct 6 as a single diastereomer (dr > 98:2) in 74% yield. Finally, treatment of 6 with MeNHOMe furnished Weinreb amide 7 in 90% yield.12\nScheme 3. Stereoselective synthesis of C9-C21 fragment of debromoaplysiatoxin\nCrimmins and Chakraborty have also used these transformations in the total syntheses of pironetin and a protected form of the monomeric unit of rhizopodin respectively (Scheme 4).13,14 Thereby, Crimmins reported that the addition of 2 to a chiral dimethyl acetal provided adduct 8 as a single diastereomer in 64% yield, which was further converted into aldehyde 9 by treatment with i-Bu2AlH (eq 1 in Scheme 4).13 In turn, Chakraborty described a similar process involving an achiral dimethyl acetal in which adduct 10 was obtained in an excellent diastereomeric ratio (dr 93:7) and 86% yield (eq 2 in Scheme 4).14 Interestingly, removal of the chiral auxiliary by the lithium salt of the dimethyl methylphosphonate furnished ketophosphonate 11 ready to participate in an HWE olefination.\nScheme 4. Total syntheses of pironetin and a monomeric unit of rhizopodin\nOther reports have also established that these Lewis acid acid-mediated couplings of N-acyl thiazolidinethiones and acetals are flexible enough to be successfully adapted to the synthesis of a broad array of natural products. For instance, Crimmins took advantage of the highly diastereoselective reaction of the titanium enolate from N-(4-pentenoyl) thiazolidinethione 12 and a dibenzyl acetal, the mild removal of the chiral auxiliary from adduct 13, and the RCM of the resultant alcohol 14 to obtain in a few steps the cyclic core 15 of aldigenin B (eq 1 in Scheme 5).15 In turn, Hodgson reported that the addition of the titanium enolate of (R)-phenylglycine-derived N-acetyl thiazolidinethione 16 to the benzaldehyde diallyl acetal provided diastereomerically pure adduct 17 in 74% yield after chromatography. Further treatment of this adduct with magnesium acetoacetate and imidazole led to \u03b2-keto ester 18, a key intermediate in the total synthesis of hyperolactone C (eq 2 in Scheme 5).16 Finally, the synthesis of hennoxazole A by Smith includes a comprehensive study on the Lewis acid-mediated additions of N-acetyl thiazolidinethiones to the dimethyl acetal of bisoxazole 19.17 This revealed that the ability of an oxazole nitrogen atom to coordinate with the titanium center altered the stereochemical outcome of such additions and the undesired diastereomer was obtained in 80:20 diastereomeric ratio and 67% yield. Looking for alternative conditions, Smith found that the enolization of N-acetyl thiazolidinethione 20 using Sammakia's conditions (PhBCl2/sparteine) followed by the BF3\u00b7OEt2-mediated addition of the resultant boron enolate to 19 provided the desired adduct 21 in 86:14 diastereomeric ratio and 53% yield (eq 3 in Scheme 5). Eventually, reduction of 21 with i-Bu2AlH gave aldehyde 22, which was immediately used in the next step.\nScheme 5. Total syntheses of aldigenin B, hyperolactone C, and hennoxazole\nDialkyl acetals are not the only suitable substrates for these transformations. Certainly, oxocarbenium cations from cyclic hemiacetals and glycals (see Scheme 2) can also undergo highly diastereoselective additions to titanium enolates from N-acyl thiazolidinethiones, as was used by our group in the stereoselective synthesis of the western hemisphere of salinomycin. Indeed, the SnCl4-mediated addition of the titanium enolate from N-butanoyl thiazolidinethione 23 to hemiacetal 24 afforded \u03b1-C-glycoside 25 as a single diastereomer (dr > 97:3), which was treated with methanol to obtain methyl ester 26 in 75% overall yield (eq 1 in Scheme 6).18 More recently, Leighton has reported that the coupling of structurally complex O-acetyl hemiacetal 27 with the titanium enolate of ent-2 produced \u03b1-C-glycoside 28 as a single diastereomer in an outstanding 91% yield (eq 2 in Scheme 6).19 Methanolysis proceeded exceptionally smoothly to give 29 in quantitative yield, which was finally converted into zincophorin methyl ester in a few steps.\nScheme 6. Syntheses of antibiotic polyethers\nIn summary, the Lewis acid-mediated addition of titanium enolates from N-acyl thiazolidinethiones to dialkyl acetals, hemiacetals, or glycals represents a powerful synthetic tool for the stereoselective construction of carbon-carbon bonds leading to anti \u03b1-alkyl-\u03b2-alkoxy carboxylic derivatives. Importantly, the chiral auxiliary can be easily removed using a number of mild conditions, which confers to these methodologies a remarkable appeal for the synthesis of natural products."

An oven-dried (110 \u00b0C), three-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1.25-inch egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and three rubber septa, one containing a temperature probe and another a nitrogen inlet. Solid (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (\"DIB,\" 23.9 g, 74.2 mmol, 1.35 equiv) (Note 1) is added under purging N2 followed by CH3CN (480 mL) (Note 2). The flask is purged for 5 min and the contents are maintained under inert atmosphere during all subsequent operations. The stirrer is set to 560 rpm and neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 6.4 mL, 83.6 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 3) is carefully added via syringe over 3 min at room temperature, whereupon the mixture becomes homogeneous.\nA solution of methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (1) (9.1 g, 54.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) in CH3CN (20 mL), prepared in a flame-dried 50-mL round-bottomed flask, is added to the DIB solution over 3 h via syringe pump (Note 5). During the addition, the tip of the needle is immersed into the solution to a depth of 0.5 inch and the progress of the reaction is followed by TLC (Note 6). At the end of the addition (Note 7), the solution turns light brown. The mixture is transferred to a one-necked 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated under reduced pressure (mechanical pump vacuum, 175 mmHg) at 32 \u00b0C (rotary evaporator bath temperature). Toluene (10 mL) (Note 8) is then added and the resulting suspension is concentrated under reduced pressure to azeotropically remove residual TFA. Addition of toluene and evaporation are repeated twice again to ensure removal of essentially all of the TFA.\nThe resultant residue is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) (Note 9) and silica gel (40.0 g) (Note 10) is added to the solution. The CH2Cl2 is then removed under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator, 175 mmHg, 32 \u00b0C). Residual solvent is further removed under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg). The resultant free-flowing powder is loaded onto a chromatography column (3.0 inches in diameter) that had been dry-packed with silica (160.0 g). A layer of sand (1.0 inch) was placed on top of the dry silica and a mobile phase (gradient 50%, 75%, 100% EtOAc/Hexanes, 25%, 50%, 75% MeCN/ CH2Cl2, 200 mL each) (Notes 11 and 12) is passed through the silica, followed by MeCN (400 mL) to flush out the remaining product. The fractions determined to contain product via TLC analysis (Note 6) are combined and concentrated via rotary evaporator. (Note 13) Further solvent removal under high vacuum provides the pure product (2) as a brown solid (7.7 g, 34.5 mmol, 63% yield) (Notes 14 and 15)."

With no precautions to exclude air or moisture, a 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (38 x 16 mm). 4-Bromoaniline (Note 2) (15.1 g, 88.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 3) (17.1 g, 89.8 mmol, 1.02 equiv) are weighed into plastic weigh boats and added to the vessel through a powder funnel. Dichloromethane (Note 4) (230 mL) is then poured into the vessel from a graduated cylinder, followed by the addition of pyridine (Note 5) (7.8 mL, 97 mmol, 1.1 equiv) by syringe in two portions. The reaction vessel is stoppered with a rubber septum and an 18-gauge needle to vent the reaction to air before stirring (~500 rpm) at room temperature (20 \u00b0C) for 16 h.The reaction mixture turns from yellow to clear orange immediately after the addition of pyridine.After the reaction is judged complete by TLC analysis (Note 6), the reaction mixture is poured into a 2 L separatory funnel containing 800 mL of sat. NH4Cl(aq) (Note 7). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layer is then washed with water (400 mL), brine (400 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (10.0 g, ~1 min) (Note 8).The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass B\u00fcchner funnel.The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg) to yield 28.5-28.6 g (99% yield) of N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide as a white solid (Note 9).",
            "B. Ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)butanoate (2). A 500-mL 3-necked Morton flask with 24/40 ground-glass joints is equipped with a nitrogen-gas inlet on the left neck, a glass stopper on the right neck, and the center neck is equipped for mechanical stirring (glass bearing, glass stirrer rod, 60 mm PTFE paddle, RW 20 Tekmar motor) (Note 10). NiI2.xH2O (528 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv) (Note 11), 4,4'-di-methoxy-2,2'-bipyridine (284 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv) (Note 12), sodium iodide (1.25 g, 8.34 mmol, 0.33 equiv) (Note 13), and N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (8.33 g, 25.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) are transferred via powder funnel through the right neck of the Morton flask.To these solids, 1,3-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU, 105 mL) (Note 14) is added from a graduated cylinder.Then pyridine (105 \u03bcL, 1.31 mmol, 0.053 equiv) (Note 5) and ethyl 4-bromobutyrate (4.0 mL, 28 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 15) are added by syringe.A gas outlet adapter with tubing attached to an oil-filled bubbler is placed in the right neck before submerging the reaction vessel up to the solvent line in an oil bath pre-equilibrated to 60 \u00b0C.The vessel headspace is purged with nitrogen for 15 min while the mixture is stirred (500-600 rpm) (Note 16).After the nitrogen purge is complete, the gas outlet on the right neck is replaced with the original glass stopper and the reaction mixture is stirred at 60 \u00b0C until the reaction mixture takes on a dark green color (15-30 min) (Note 17). Next, zinc powder (6-9 \u03bcm, 3.44 g, 52.6 mmol, 2.06 equiv) (Note 18) is added through a powder funnel attached to the right neck under a positive flow of nitrogen.The flask is kept under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen during the course of the reaction.Generally within 5-15 min after the addition of zinc, the reaction undergoes a characteristic dark green to orange-brown color change, indicating the reaction has begun.The reaction is judged complete when the color changes to black (Note 19).\nOnce the reaction mixture changes color to black, it is allowed to cool to room temperature before filtering though a pad of diatomaceous earth (15 g, wetted with 40 mL of diethyl ether and packed firmly in place) (Note 20) in a 350-mL course-fritted glass B\u00fcchner funnel.The reaction vessel is rinsed with ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 21) and these rinses are filtered as well.The filtrate is poured into a 1 L separatory funnel containing 150 mL of 1 M NH4Cl(aq). The organic layer is separated and set aside.The aqueous layer is then extracted with additional ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (75 mL) and brine (75 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (15 g, ~1 min). The solids are removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass Buchner funnel and washed with ether (20 mL). The filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg) to give a colorless oil.The aqueous layers are combined and set aside for later recovery of DMPU, if desired (Note 22).\nThe oil is purified by stepped-gradient flash chromatography on silica gel (column diameter 90 mm, 225 g SiO2) (Note 23).The column is dry-packed with silica gel, equilibrated with hexanes (500 mL, passed through the column twice) (Note 24), and the compound is loaded directly onto the silica with dichloromethane (3 mL). The vessel containing the crude material is rinsed with 95:5 hexanes:EtOAc (5 mL), and additional dichloromethane (5 mL), which are then used to rinse the sides of the column (Note 25). After adding a layer of sand (~12 mm.) to the column, the compound is eluted with the following ratios (v:v) of hexanes:EtOAc: 95:5 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 90:10 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 85:15 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 80:20 (500 mL), 75:25 (1000 mL), 70:30 (500 mL), 65:35 (500 mL), and 60:40 (500 mL) (Note 26).Fractions are collected in 25 mm x 150 mm test-tubes (~65-70 mL).The fractions containing only product as determined by TLC (Note 19) are rinsed with EtOAc into a tared 1 L recovery flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg).A small, tared PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar (7 mm x 2 mm) is added to the viscous, colorless oil before drying on high vacuum (0.1 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C) for 1 h to remove any traces of solvent.A heat gun is used to gently warm the oil while on high vacuum and the heat is removed as soon as gas bubbles begin to evolve.After drying, the flask contained 7.16-7.70 g (78%-83% yield) (Note 27) of ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)-butanoate as a colorless viscous oil."

One outer neck is sealed with a glass stopper; the other neck is capped with a rubber septum through which a thermocouple probe is inserted (Note 2). The flask is immersed in a dry ice/acetonitrile bath and stirring is begun. After the internal temperature reaches -45 \u00b0C, HBr (48% aq. solution, 3.6 mL, 32 mmol, 0.2 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe through the septum in 1 min. The addition funnel is charged with neat Br2 (9.0 mL, 175 mmol, 1.1 equiv), which is then added dropwise until the orange-red color indicative of excess bromine persists (Note 3). After 10 min, the addition funnel is replaced by a clean 125-mL addition funnel charged with pyridine (25.5 mL, 316 mmol, 2.0 equiv), which is then added dropwise over 15 min (Note 4). After the addition, the cold bath is removed and the dropping funnel is replaced by a reflux condenser equipped with a gas inlet adapter, which is connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min, then heated to reflux (43 \u00b0C) for 1 h using a heating mantle. After cooling to room temperature the flask contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the reaction flask is washed with CH2Cl2 (50 mL), and the additional solution is added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is washed with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (0.7 M, 150 mL). The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 1M HCl (100 mL). The organic layer is removed and the acidic, aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL). The combined organic fraction is washed with water (50 mL), brine (50 mL), and then filtered through a bed of Na2SO4 (50 g) into a tared 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 200 mmHg) to about 60 mL (84 g), then hexanes (100 mL) are added and the concentration continued to dryness (Note 5). Vacuum drying (10 mmHg) to constant weight (1.5 h) affords crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexenen-1-one (26.7 g, 98% yield) as a slightly yellow powder. The crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexen-1-one is suitable for the cyanation-elimination reaction without purification (Notes 6, 7, 8).\nCaution! Sodium cyanide and HCN are extremely toxic. The experimentalist should use sufficient personal protection and only handle sodium cyanide solid and solutions in a well-ventilated fume hood. The aqueous waste solutions containing cyanide should be treated with excess bleach before disposal.2 Good housekeeping is essential - all spills around balances or work areas should be immediately cleaned up and the area washed down with bleach.",
            "B. 3-Oxocyclohex-1-enecarbonitrile. A 500-mL round-bottomed flask is charged with MeOH (120 mL) (Note 9), crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexen-1-one (18.6 g, 106 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and a magnetic stir bar (PTFE-coated, oval, 3 cm). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and inserting an 18-gauge needle through the septum provides a nitrogen inlet. A thermocouple probe is also inserted through the septum (Note 2). The reaction flask is immersed in a tap-water bath and then neat AcOH (6.5 mL, 114 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise to the stirred solution via syringe over 1 min. After 5 min, the septum is briefly removed, solid NaCN (5.68 g, 116 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added in one portion, and the septum is replaced (Note 10). After 10 min a second portion of NaCN (2.73 g, 56 mol, 0.5 equiv) is added, followed, after another 10 min, by a third portion of NaCN (1.25 g, 26 mmol, 0.25 equiv), replacing the septum after each addition. After 20 min (Note 11), the water bath is replaced with an ice-water bath. Once the flask contents equilibrate to 5 \u00b0C, the septum is removed, and an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.5 M, 100 mL) is added. After 1 min, solid NaCl (10 g) is added and the mixture is stirred for 5 min. The flask contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the reaction flask is washed with EtOAc (100 mL), and the additional solution is added to the separatory funnel. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic phase is washed with 5 \u00b0C aqueous NaOH (1M, 100 mL) (Note 12) and then washed with brine (2 x 50 mL). The organic phase is dried by filtering through a bed of Na2SO4 (50 g) into a tared 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) to afford an orange oil (12.6 g), which is purified by column chromatography on Florisil (Notes 13 and 14) to afford 3-Oxocyclohex-1-enecarbonitrile (8.07 g, 63% yield) as a pale yellow oil spectrally identical to material previously reported (Note 15).3"

To a one-necked 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm x 7 mm) is added 2-amino-5-bromobenzoic acid (1) (9.87 g, 45.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and dry THF (400 mL) (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a septum and nitrogen inlet needle. The solution is cooled in an ice bath under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas. Lithium aluminum hydride (5.00 g, 132 mmol, 2.9 equiv) (Note 2) is added portion-wise (0.5 g portions) over the course of 1 h by temporarily removing the septum. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight with stirring (20 h). When the reaction is complete as determined by TLC (Note 3) the crude reaction mixture is poured slowly into ethyl acetate (400 mL) in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar cooled in an ice bath (Note 4). The excess LiAlH4 is quenched by the slow addition of water (50 mL) to the stirred mixture over 30 min. Additional water is added (450 mL) and the mixture is stirred until two distinct layers form (~30 min). The mixture is transferred to a 2 L separatory funnel and the layers separated. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2 x 500 mL) (Note 5). The combined organic layers are transferred to a 4 L separatory funnel, washed with brine (600 mL) and dried for 30 min over Na2SO4 (100 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg) to give a light yellow solid. Analytically pure material is obtained after recrystallization. Into a one-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm x 5 mm) the crude material is dissolved in a minimum amount of refluxing ethyl acetate (15 mL). Hexanes (~100 mL) is added over 10 min to the stirred and refluxing mixture until the product precipitates (Note 6). The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stored in the freezer at -15 \u00b0C for 3 h. The product is isolated by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with hexanes (50 mL), and dried by vacuum (0.01 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) to provide a first crop (6.53-7.01 g). A second crop is obtained from the combined filtrates after removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg). The resulting solids are dissolved in a one-necked, 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm x 5 mm) in a minimum amount of refluxing ethyl acetate (5 mL). To the refluxing, stirred solution is added hexanes (50 mL) over 10 min until precipitation begins. After cooling to room temperature the suspension is stored in a freezer at -15 \u00b0C overnight for collection of a second crop (0.91-1.09 g) by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The alcohol 2 is obtained in 80-88% yield (7.44-8.10 g) as a light tan powder (Note 7).",

To a one-necked 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm x 7 mm) is added 2-amino-5-bromobenzyl alcohol (2) (6.10 g, 30.0 mmol, 1 equiv) and MeCN (60 mL) (Note 8). [CuI(MeCN)4](OTf) (569 mg, 1.51 mmol, 0.05 equiv), 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) (236 mg, 1.51 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) (236 mg, 1.51 mmol, 0.05 equiv) (Note 9) are each added as a solid, and the weighing vessel (often a small test tube) is rinsed with MeCN (30 mL each) to ensure complete delivery of the reagents and a total reaction volume of 150 mL. After the addition of N-methyl imidazole (NMI) (240 \u03bcL, 248 mg, 3.02 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 10), the dark red/brown reaction mixture is stirred open to air at 500 rpm (Note 11) at room temperature until the starting material is consumed as determined by TLC (2-3 h) (Note 3) (Note 12). Upon completion, the reaction mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate (300 mL), filtered through a plug of silica (Note 13), and washed with ethyl acetate (400 mL). The solvent is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 0.04 mmHg) to afford the crude aldehyde as a yellow brown solid (Note 14). Analytically pure material is obtained after purification by silica column chromatography. The solid is dissolved in a minimum amount of CHCl3 (20 mL) and loaded onto a column prepared from silica gel (150 g, Silicycle SiliaFlash\u00ae P60, 230-400 mesh) slurried in 10% EtOAc-hexanes (column dimensions: 5.5 cm diameter x 30 cm height, 18 cm packed height). Elution with 10% EtOAc-hexanes (200 mL initial collection followed by 30 mL fractions, 1.4 L total solvent volume eluted) affords the product in fractions 19-35. The product containing fractions are combined and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (0.1 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C). Subsequent drying at 0.01 mmHg (22 \u00b0C) provides aldehyde 3 in 89-91% yield (5.37-5.50 g) as a bright yellow powder (Note 15 and 16)."

At room temperature (22 \u00b0C), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO) (15.0 g, 134 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2) is added and the flask is connected to a vacuum line via a needle inserted through the septum. The flask is evacuated then back-filled with argon. This process is repeated three times. Dry THF (180 mL) (Note 3) is introduced via syringe under a positive argon pressure. After complete dissolution, the reaction medium is ice-cooled and Karl-Fischer reagent (solution A, 120 mL, ~280 - 375 mmol SO2) (Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe at 0 \u00b0C (external temperature) over 30 min. Precipitation of DABSO is observed shortly after the addition is initiated. After stirring 30 min at 0 \u00b0C, the ice-bath is removed and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 h. The suspension is filtered through a 250-mL sintered-glass funnel under reduced pressure (vacuum pump, 15 mmHg). The white solid is washed on the funnel by triturating a few seconds with diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 5) without suction. The collected solid is transferred back to the original 500-mL flask. Diethyl ether (200 mL) is added and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for 15 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solid is collected on the same sintered-glass funnel. The re-slurry procedure is repeated twice in the same manner. Since DABSO is a hygroscopic solid, it is immediately transferred into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask and dried in a desiccator under vacuum for 12 h (Note 6) to afford DABSO (30.9-31.0 g, 96-97%) as a colorless powder (Note 7)."

The colorless solution of the carbodiimide is then stirred (700 rpm) at room temperature for approximately 20 min to allow dissolution, followed by immersion in an ice bath at 0 \u00b0C. Z-L-Phg-OH (7.26 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) and Oxyma Pure (3.67 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) are added to the cold solution of EDC-HCl as solids (Notes 4, 5 and 6). Two minutes after the addition of the reactants, H-Val-OMe-HCl (4.27 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) is added as a solid to the preactivated cocktail, followed by addition of DIEA (4.29 mL, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) using a 5-mL syringe (Note 7). The flask is then flushed with nitrogen and sealed with a polyethylene cap. The coupling cocktail is allowed to stir at 700 rpm in the ice bath for 1 h and then the reaction progresses at room temperature overnight. After 14-15 hours, the extent of peptide bond formation is monitored by TLC, showing trace amounts of starting acid and amine (Note 8). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 28 mmHg) (Note 9). The crude oily residue is diluted in AcOEt (500 mL) and transferred to a 1-L graduated separatory funnel (Note 10). The organic solution is extracted and washed with 1 N HCl (3 x 300 mL), 1 N Na2CO3 (3 x 350 mL), and saturated NaCl (3 x 350 mL).

Once cool, the central joint is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, the glass rod of which is fitted with 7.2 x 2 cm Teflon paddle, coated with lubricant (Note 1) and sheathed by a 34/45 jointed glass stirrer bearing. The remaining three necks are fitted with a thermocouple in a 24/40 adapter, an argon line connected to a 24/40 adapter, and rubber septum. The rubber septum is removed from the fourth neck and the flask is charged with ferrocene (8.0 g, 43.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2). A 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a 24/40 joint is fitted in the fourth neck and the reaction set-up is flushed with argon for 5 min (see Note 3 for an image of the reaction setup). The top of the addition funnel is sealed with a rubber septum and the entire set-up is maintained under a positive pressure of argon throughout the remaining operations. Tetrahydrofuran (480 mL) (Note 4) is added via cannula through the rubber septum and down through the addition funnel resulting in an orange solution that is stirred at room temperature. A solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (1.0 M, 5.25 mL, 5.25 mmol, 0.12 equiv) (Note 5) is added to the flask through the rubber septum using a gastight syringe. The addition funnel is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) followed by pentane (10 mL) (Note 6). The reaction solution is cooled to about -73 \u00b0C by immersion of the flask in a dry ice-acetone bath. A solution of tert-Butyllithium (1.7 M, 49.6 mL, 84.3 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 7) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 10-15 min, keeping the internal temperature around -70 \u00b0C. The addition funnel is rinsed with pentane (10 mL) with a gastight syringe. A 2-3 \u00b0C exotherm is observed during the addition and an orange slurry forms toward the end or shortly after completion of the addition. The slurry is stirred at about -70 \u00b0C for 1 h and then the dry ice-acetone bath is replaced with an ice-water bath and the content of the flask is stirred and allowed to warm. Once the internal temperature reaches ca. 0 \u00b0C (Note 8), di-tert-butylchlorophosphine (8.8 mL, 46.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 9) is charged to the addition funnel via a gastight syringe and added to the reaction mixture drop-wise over 2-3 min. The addition funnel is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). The ice/water bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC analysis (Note 10).\nTetrafluoroboric acid-diethyl ether complex (11.5 mL, 84.5 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 11) is added at ambient temperature to the reaction mixture via gastight syringe through the septum over ca. 5 min. A slight exotherm (5-7 \u00b0C) is observed as the solution becomes turbid. A solid begins to precipitate within 0.5-1 h. The suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a red thin suspension (Note 12). Deionized water (100 mL) and methyl tert-butyl ether (100 mL) are added via syringe through the septum and the resulting turbid homogeneous two-layer solution is stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. The mixture is then vacuum-filtered through a 1 cm pad of Celite (ca. 30 g) in a 300-mL fritted B\u00fcchner funnel with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg. The filter pad is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) and the rinse combined with the filtrate. The filtrate is transferred to a flask and concentrated via rotary evaporation (Note 13) until all organics are removed and a red solid as a suspension in ca. 100 mL water is obtained. The suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h and vacuum-filtered using a 100-mL fritted B\u00fcchner funnel, fitted with a VWR brand No. 5 filter paper (55 mm), and with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg. The filter cake is washed with water (40 mL) and dried on the frit for 1 h using house-vacuum to obtain the crude product as an orange solid (Note 14).\nA 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask with 24/40 joints is equipped with a 5 cm magnetic stirbar, thermocouple in one neck, a 60 mL 24/40 joint pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is capped with a rubber septum in the center neck and an argon line connected to a 24/40 adapter in the third neck. The flask is charged with crude 1 and a 16-gauge needle is used to puncture the rubber septum attached to the addition funnel, allowing the flask to be flushed with argon for 5 min. Methyl tert-butyl ether (50 mL) is added via gastight syringe to the reaction flask via the addition funnel. The suspension is heated with stirring to 50-55 \u00b0C via an oil bath and, once the internal temperature reaches 50 \u00b0C, methanol (50 mL) is added via gastight syringe to the addition funnel and then to the mixture drop-wise over 5 min. The mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C for an additional 10-15 min to obtain a dark red solution. The solution is vacuum-filtered (with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg) through a B\u00fcchner funnel with #1 filter paper into a pre-warmed 500-mL 24/40 joint round-bottomed flask (Note 15) that contains a 7 cm magnetic stirbar. The B\u00fcchner funnel is replaced with a 125 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is charged with methyl tert-butyl ether (100 mL) and an argon line is attached to the top of the addition funnel. The methyl tert-butyl ether in the addition funnel is added dropwise over 5-10 min, which results in the formation of a slurry. The oil bath is removed and the slurry stirred at ambient temperature for 3 h. The slurry is filtered on a B\u00fcchner medium-fritted funnel and the cake is washed with tert-Butyl methyl ether (40 mL). The filter cake is dried using house-vacuum to obtain 1 (11.0 g, 61%) as a light orange solid (Notes 16)."

The prepared Grignard reagent is transferred to the addition funnel using an 18-gauge cannula and added to the propargyl bromide over 3 h. After the addition, the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 2 h at 0 \u00b0C (Note 3). Then the mixture is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a cold saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (200 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is back-extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL x 2) (Note 2). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C water bath). Purification is performed by vacuum distillation (70-80 \u00b0C/23 mmHg, fractionating column: 2 cm diameter x 15 cm length) to afford 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene(1) (18.6 g, 57% by the checker; 24.9 g, 77% by the submitter, see discussion) as a colorless liquid (Note 4).",
            "B. 1-Acetyl-2-phenethylidenecyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester (2). A 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, the top of which is fitted with a stopcock connected to a vacuum line with an argon flow. The other two necks are fitted with rubber septa. After evacuating and backfilling with argon the flask is charged with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter), Rh2(OAc)4 (180 mg, 0.4 mmol, 0.008 equiv) (Note 5), 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene (1) (19.5 g, 150 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 6) and CH2Cl2 (40 mL) (Note 2) under argon. The mixture is heated to reflux using an oil bath (55 \u00b0C, external temperature) and after 5 min at reflux, a solution of ethyl \u03b1-diazoacetoacetate2 (7.8 g, 50 mmol, 1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) is added using a syringe pump (10 mL/h). Upon completion of the addition, an additional quantity of Rh2(OAc)4 (40 mg, 0.1 mmol, 0.002 equiv) (Note 7) is added and the resulting mixture is refluxed for 2 h; the progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 3). Upon completion, the reaction is cooled to room temperature and concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 35 \u00b0C water bath). The residue is purified by column chromatography (column \u2205 = 80 mm with 300 g of silica gel (230-400 mesh); ~150 mL fractions; n-hexane (1.5 L) (Note 2) is used to recover 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene 1 (fractions 5-12, 7.64 g, 39%); then a mixture of 3:1 n-hexane:ethyl acetate (Note 2) (2 L) is used to elute 1-acetyl-2-phenethylidene- cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester 2 (fractions 20-25, 15.1 g ) (Note 8).",
            "C. 1-Benzyl-2-methyl-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-4-(2-phenylethyl)-1H-pyrrole (3). To a 100-mL round-bottomed flask is added, in succession, a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) (Note 1), crude product 2 (15.0 g), CH3CN (15 mL, Note 2), benzylamine (9.8 mL, 90 mmol) (Note 2) and CH3CN (15 mL). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and the top of the condenser left open to the air. After being heated with an oil bath (80 \u00b0C) for 19 h the reaction is judged complete as evidenced by TLC (Note 3). The resulting mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 35 \u00b0C water bath) and the residue is purified by column chromatography (column \u2205 = 80 mm, 300 g of silica gel, 230-400 mesh). A mixture of petroleum ether (8.0 L) (Note 2) and ethyl acetate (0.2 L) (Note 2) are used as eluent, collecting ~150 mL fractions. Concentration of fractions 21-50 by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C water bath) affords 1-benzyl-2-methyl-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-4-(2-phenylethyl)-1H-pyrrole (3) (9.05 g, 52% combined yield for steps B and C) as a light yellow solid (Notes 9 and 10)."

            "A. (RS)-N-[1-Phenylethylidene]-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (3). An oven-dried 100-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask containing an octagonal Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.2 x 0.8 cm), fitted with a vacuum adapter and a rubber septum, is charged with acetophenone (1) (6.01 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and (RS)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (2) (6.06 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 1). After applying vacuum followed by flushing with argon, the stirred mixture is treated with Ti(OEt)4 (21.3 mL, 22.8 g, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2), added by syringe. At this point, the reaction shows an intense yellow color. The rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper, and the stirred (700 rpm) mixture is heated so as to maintain the temperature of the oil bath at 72 \u00b0C for 4 h (Note 3), during which period its color changes to orange. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL), and then transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a mixture of ethyl acetate :brine (25 mL:25 mL). The resulting pale yellow suspension is filtered through a short plug of Celite (Note 4), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 1000 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford crude imine 3 as a yellow oil (Note 5). The crude material is purified by flash column chromatography (24 x 4.5 cm column containing 160 g of silica gel) (Note 6). A mixture of hexanes:ethyl acetate is used as the eluent, with a gradient of polarity as follows: hexanes:ethyl acetate 100:0 (about 500 mL), 20:1 (about 300 mL), 15:1 (about 300 mL), 9:1 (about 600 mL), 3:2 (about 300 mL), and finally 1:1 until no more product elutes (about 300 mL) (Notes 7 and 8). Fractions containing pure product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the resultant product is then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford imine 3 (9.54-9.78 g, 85-88% yield) as a yellow solid (Notes 9 and 10).",
            "B. (R,RS)-N-(1-Phenylethyl)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (4). An oven-dried 500-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an octagonal Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.8 x 0.9 cm), a condenser topped with a vacuum adapter with an argon inlet, and a rubber septum. After applying vacuum and flushing with argon, the flask is charged with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (490 mg, 0.8 mmol, 0.025 equiv), 2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol (143 mg, 1.6 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and 4 \u00c5 MS (3 g) while maintaining a positive pressure of argon (Notes 11 and 12). The system is again evacuated and filled with argon [5 cycles vacuum (6 seconds), then argon], and a positive pressure of argon is maintained throughout the remainder of the experiment. Dry isopropyl alcohol (25 mL) is added using a syringe (Note 13) and the rubber septum is replaced by a glass stopper. The stirred (450 rpm) reaction mixture is then placed in a preheated oil bath (bath temperature 86 \u00b0C) for 25 min, resulting in a color change to cherry-red (Note 14). The oil-bath is replaced with a water-bath (preheated to 50 \u00b0C) and heating is adjusted to maintain the temperature at about 50 \u00b0C (Note 15). After replacing the glass stopper with a rubber septum, a previously prepared solution of imine 3 (7.147 g, 32.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (160 mL) under argon is added to the reaction mixture using a cannula (over about 10 min), and the stirring speed is increased to 600 rpm. The temperature of the system is allowed to stabilize at 50 \u00b0C over approximately 5 minutes, then a previously prepared solution of potassium tert-butoxide (449 mg, 4.0 mmol, 0.125 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (40 mL) is added to the reaction mixture using a syringe (Note 16). The resulting brownish mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C (external temperature) for 2 h (Note 17). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath for 15 min, then filtered through a short plug of silica gel (Note 18), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 600 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). In order to ensure the removal of the ruthenium complex, solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the residue is dissolved in 40 mL of ethyl acetate and passed through a short plug of silica gel (Note 19), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 500 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford pure sulfinamide 4 (7.20-7.22 g, >99% yield) as a brown oil (Notes 20 , 21 and 22).",
            "C. (R)-1-Phenylethanamine (5). A 250-mL one-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an octagonal Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (3.2 x 0.8 cm) and sealed with a septum fitted with needle connected to a vacuum/nitrogen line. The flask is purged using a vacuum followed by nitrogen introduction (3 times) and maintained under a positive pressure of nitrogen. It is then charged with 4 (6.76 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and dry methanol (60 mL) (Note 23) using a syringe. The solution is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C using an ice-water bath. While stirring, a 2M solution of HCl in diethyl ether (75 mL, 150 mmol, 5.0 equiv) is added by syringe (Note 24). After 5 min, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred (600 rpm) at room temperature for 3 h. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (10-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature). The residue is dissolved in aqueous 2M HCl solution (100 mL) then extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL). While the combined organic layers are discarded, the acidic aqueous layer is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C using an ice-water bath and treated with aqueous 6M NaOH solution (100 mL), which is added in portions over 5 min while stirring, resulting in a pH > 12. The resulting mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL) and the combined organic layers are washed with H2O (25 mL) and brine (25 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (4 g), filtered, then concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) (Note 25) to afford pure amine 5 (3.09-3.22 g, 85-88% yield, 95% ee of the (R)-enantiomer)as a pale yellow oil (Notes 26 and 27)."

            "A. Dimethyldioxirane. Distilled H2O (20 mL), acetone (30 mL), and NaHCO3 (24 g, 0.285 mol) are combined in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and chilled in an ice/water bath with magnetic stirring (oblong stirbar, 3 cm x 1 cm x 1.5 cm) for 20 min (Note 1). After 20 min, stirring is halted and Oxone (25 g, 0.0406 mol) is added in a single portion (Note 2). The flask is loosely covered and the slurry is stirred vigorously for 15 min while still submerged in the ice bath. After 15 min, the stir bar is removed from the reaction flask and rinsed with a small portion of distilled water.\nThe flask containing the reaction slurry is then attached to a rotary evaporator with the bath at room temperature. The bump bulb (250 mL) (Note 3) is chilled in a dry ice/acetone bath and a vacuum of 155 mmHg is applied via a benchtop diaphragm pump and an accompanied in-line vacuum regulator. During this process, the flask is rotated vigorously (210 rpm) to prevent bumping of the slurry into the bump trap (Note 4). After 15 min, the bath temperature is raised to 40 \u00b0C over the course of 10 min. When the bath reaches 40 \u00b0C, the distillation is halted immediately via releasing the vacuum and raising the flask from the heated water bath.\nThe pale yellow acetone solution of DMDO is decanted from the bump bulb directly into a graduated cylinder to measure the total volume of the solution (an average of 25 mL) and then the solution is dried over Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 is removed by filtration and rinsed with 10 mL of acetone. Titration of the obtained DMDO solution is then performed according to the procedure of Adam, et al.2 (Note 5). Results consistently show 2.1-2.3 mmol total DMDO in the solution, giving a final concentration typically in the range of 60-65 mM (Note 6). The DMDO solution was used immediately following titration."

The contents are cooled to \u201310 \u00b0C by means of a Dewar filled with isopropanol and an immersion cooler (Neslab CC 100) (Note 3), then 100% formic acid (21.1 mL, 25.8 g, 560 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added in portions to the flask over 3 min via a measuring cylinder [Caution: exotherm from \u201310 \u00b0C to 1 \u00b0C]. The resulting colorless reaction mixture is then heated in an oil bath on a hot plate to 43 \u00b0C (internal temperature) over 25 min. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 h (42\u201344 \u00b0C, internal temperature) and monitored by 1H NMR analysis (Note 5).\n1H NMR analysis of crude reaction aliquots is employed to determine the quantity of acetic formic anhydride in the reaction mixture (18.1 g, 206 mmol). Formic anhydride (2.4 g, 32 mmol) was also present (Notes 6 and 7). The crude anhydride mixture is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C over 30 min using an ice bath. While maintaining a positive pressure of argon, the Vigreux condenser is removed and replaced with a rubber septum with an argon inlet.\nA 500-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, an internal thermometer, and a rubber septum with an argon inlet, is charged with benzotriazole (23.8 g, 200 mmol, 0.84 equiv relative to formylating agents (Notes 6 and 8).

The crude mixed anhydride is then added to the benzotriazole solution via cannula over 12 min, ensuring that the internal temperature does not exceed \u20135 \u00b0C (Note 9). Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture is cooled to \u201315 \u00b0C (internal temperature) by means of a Dewar filled with isopropanol and an immersion cooler (Neslab CC 100) (Note 3) and vigorously stirred until completion by TLC analysis (2 h) (Note 10), at which point the reaction mixture is thick and cream colored.\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a single-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated to dryness by rotatory evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 20 mmHg). Chloroform (50 mL) (Notes 11 and 12) is added to the flask and the solution is concentrated again (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 20 mmHg). The dilution and concentration procedure is repeated 3 times, yielding a white solid. The solid is dried at room temperature, under 0.75 mmHg for 12 h.
