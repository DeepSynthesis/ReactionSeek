Procedure:<'''D. (3S)-1-(Dimethylphenylsilyl)-1-buten-3-ol (3d) . Acetate (S)-3b (9.0 g, 36.27 mmol) is dissolved under a nitrogen atmosphere in a cooled (0°C), 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing 120 mL of anhydrous Et2O (Note 13). To this stirred mixture is slowly added over 10 min 1.81 g (47.79 mmol, 1.3 eq) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). After 15 min, aqueous 5% hydrochloric acid is added dropwise until bubbling ceases (Note 13). The resulting suspension is further diluted with a total volume of 100 mL of the acidic solution. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 mL of Et2O . The combined organic extracts are washed with an aqueous saturated solution of sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated under vacuum, to yield 6.27 g (30.42 mmol, 83%) of the (S)-alcohol 3d. No additional purification is performed (Note 14).'''>

In this reaction, tert-butyl-N-hydroxycarbamate, triethylamine, and diphenylphosphinic chloride are used to produce tert-butyl (diphenylphosphoryl)oxycarbamate. The reaction is carried out by first combining tert-butyl-N-hydroxycarbamate and dichloromethane in a 1-L 3-necked flask and cooling the mixture to -5°C to -15°C. Triethylamine is then added dropwise over 10 minutes, followed by the addition of diphenylphosphinic chloride in dichloromethane over 30 minutes with a high nitrogen sweep while maintaining the internal temperature below 0 ºC. After determining the completion of the reaction by 1H NMR, the organic phase is warmed above 10°C, washed with a 5% aqueous citric acid solution, and then concentrated to form a slurry that is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The product is then collected as a white solid.

Solvents used in this reaction include dichloromethane, 5% aqueous citric acid solution, hexane, and 4:1 hexane:dichloromethane mixture. The reaction is carried out at -5°C to -15°C and warmed above 10°C, and the stirring time is 12 hours at room temperature. The yield of the reaction is 95%.</s>
