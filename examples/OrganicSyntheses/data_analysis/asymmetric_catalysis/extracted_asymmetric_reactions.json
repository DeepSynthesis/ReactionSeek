For chiral \u03b1 -substituted amines, the most useful procedure involves the reduction of chiral ketimines or the addition of organometallic reagents to chiral aldimines.3 Among different possible starting imines, those possessing a sulfinyl moiety attached to the nitrogen atom are of especial interest because this group plays two important roles: (a) activation of the C=N group in the reaction with nucleophiles, and (b) introduction of asymmetric information, which makes it possible to perform asymmetric reactions. Two families of chiral sulfinyl imines have been reported in the literature, one containing a p-tolyl group4 and the other a tert-butyl group5 attached to the sulfinyl ...",

In air, a 250 mL one-necked round-bottomed flask (24/40), equipped with a Teflon coated oval-shaped magnetic stirrer bar (40 mm \u00d7 20 mm), is suspended in a water bath at 25 \u00b0C and charged with MeOH (70 mL) (Note 2). Stirring of 250 rpm is initiated. (S)-(-)-4-Bromophenyl methyl sulfoxide (1) (7.67 g, 35.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Notes 3 and 4) followed by (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (33.8 g, 105 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added to the flask as single portions via powder funnel. Ammonium carbamate (10.9 g, 140 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 6) is then added gradually to the suspension in roughly ten equal portions over a period of ten min allowing for controlled decarboxylation. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h, during which time the reaction mixture turns from colorless to yellow, and reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Figure 1a and b) (Note 7).\nFigure 1. a) Decarboxylation of ammonium carbamate; b) Reaction mixture after 1 h; c)...",
