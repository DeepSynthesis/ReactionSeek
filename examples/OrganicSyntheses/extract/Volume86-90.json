            "A. 5-Phenyl-1,3-dimethoxybenzene. To a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser (central neck), an internal thermometer and a ground-glass stopper, 5-phenylcyclohexane-1,3-dione (7.98 g, 42.4 mmol) (Note 1) and methanol (80 mL) are added (Note 2). Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 mL, 95%) is added dropwise over 1 min and the suspension turns into a homogeneous solution. After 10 min iodine (23.7 g, 93.4 mmol, 2.20 equiv) is added as a solid in one portion. The mixture is refluxed for 45 min (oil bath; T = 85 \u00b0C) and then cooled down to room temperature. The solution is added to an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (0.5 m, 350 mL) and 150 mL of ether. Using a 1-L separatory funnel the aqueous phase is separated and the organic phase is washed with 2 \u00d7 100 mL of 0.5 m sodium thiosulfate solution, giving a yellowish organic phase. The aqueous phases are combined and extracted with 2 \u00d7 150 mL of ether. The combined organic phase was washed with brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (1.80 g) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (600 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C, then 15 mmHg), (8.87 g, light brown oil). Silica gel (10 g) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) are added and agitated. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (125 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C, then 15 mmHg). A sintered glass funnel (h \u00d7 d: 9 cm \u00d7 5 cm) is charged with 20 g of silica gel (ca. 2.5 cm layer). A layer of sand (0.5 cm) is put on top followed by the crude material adsorbed on silica gel and another layer of sand (0.5 cm). A mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (50:1; 750 mL) is passed through the silica gel plug by applying vacuum from below and collected (Note 3). After evaporation of the solvent on a rotary evaporator and drying under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) biaryl 1 is obtained as a white solid (6.04-6.42 g, 66-71%, mp 61.0-61.9 \u00b0C) (Note 4).",
            "B. (3,5-Dimethoxy-1-phenyl-cyclohexa-2,5-dienyl)-acetonitrile. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The central neck of the reaction flask is fitted with a large cold-finger condenser. The flask with the condenser is heated in an oven overnight (120 \u00b0C). The two remaining necks are closed with ground-glass stoppers and the hot glassware is connected via the cold-finger condenser to a vacuum-nitrogen line. Vacuum is applied until the glassware is cooled down to room temperature and the glassware is flushed with nitrogen (Note 5). Biaryl 1 (6.08 g, 28.4 mmol) is introduced under nitrogen, and dissolved in anhydrous THF (100 mL) (Note 6). A T-joint with a bubbler for exhaust is introduced between the vacuum-nitrogen line and the cold-finger condenser. One ground-glass stopper is exchanged with a gas inlet valve connected to an ammonia tank (Note 7, 8) the other stopper with an internal thermometer. The flask and the cold-finger condenser are cooled to -78 \u00b0C (bath temperature) using acetone and dry-ice, then ammonia (200 mL approximately) is condensed (Note 9). The gas inlet is replaced with a stopper and lithium (435 mg, 62.7 mmol, 2.21 equiv) (Note 10) is added portion wise at -78 \u00b0C under a nitrogen flow during 10 min. During lithium addition the solution turns rapidly brown and finally brick red. After 45 minutes of stirring at this temperature, one of the glass stoppers is replaced by a septum and a cold solution of chloroacetonitrile (5.40 mL, 85.3 mmol, 3.00 equiv) in anhydrous THF (20 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min, keeping the temperature below -70 \u00b0C (Note 11). The mixture turns immediately brown. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction is quenched by addition of solid ammonium chloride (3.50 g). The cooling bath and condenser are removed and ammonia is allowed to evaporate under air (Note 12). When the reaction mixture has reached room temperature, a saturated ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) is added, followed by water (50 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL) in a 1-L separating funnel. The combined organic phases are washed with brine (150 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (2 g) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (125 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C, then 15 mmHg). The resulting brown paste (8.20 g) is purified by flash chromatography (Note 13). After concentration of the product-containing fractions on a rotary evaporator and drying under vacuum (0.1 mmHg), the bis-enol ether is obtained in 2 fractions: white solid (5.11 g) with mp = 101.0-102.0 \u00b0C (Note 14), off-white fraction (1.17 g) with mp = 98.0-99.0 \u00b0C (Note 15) (total yield: 6.28-6.65 g, 87-88%)."

Hexanes (300 mL) (Note 2) are added, and the suspension is stirred, allowed to settle, and the supernatant (250 mL) is poured off by decantation. Dry THF (300 mL) (Note 3) is added to the flask, and a reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, a thermometer, and a rubber septum are attached. A solution of 3'-bromo-acetophenone (30.0 g, 20 mL, 151 mmol) (Note 4) in dry THF (60 mL) is added over 5 min via syringe to the sodium hydride suspension. The resulting light brown suspension is stirred for 5 min, and a solution of 2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (24.9 g, 137 mmol) (Note 5) in dry THF (60 mL) is added over 10 min via syringe. Additional dry THF (120 mL) is used to rinse the sides of the flask. The resulting orange-brown solution is heated in an oil bath until the internal temperature is 60 \u00b0C. The solution darkens in color as the reaction proceeded. After stirring for 24 h, the reaction solution is cooled to room temperature. Only trace starting material remains as determined by TLC: product (1) Rf = 0.5 (4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate). To allow more volume during quenching, the mixture is transferred equally into two 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks. To each portion is added brine (150 mL) (Note 6) and ethyl acetate (150 mL). After the reaction is safely quenched, all material is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and the organic layer is washed with additional brine (100 mL).

During the addition of triisopropyl phosphite the internal temperature of the flask is maintained between 3 and 5 \u00b0C. The mixture is then stirred (internal temperature, 3 \u00b0C) until the starting material has been completely consumed as shown by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Note 8), at which point the mixture is quenched with sodium bicarbonate (saturated aqueous solution, 85 mL) added through the addition funnel with the stopcock open (Note 9). The mixture is transferred into a 500-mL separatory funnel and the organic phase separated. The aqueous phase is extracted further with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 40 mL) and the combined organic phase is washed once with water (80 mL), transferred into a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) to give 27.0-28.5 g of a brown oil (Note 10).

A stir bar is inserted into the flask, heptane (15 mL) is added, and the flask is heated with stirring to 50 \u00b0C in an oil bath (external temperature). Ethyl acetate (1 mL) is added, and the solution is decanted into a second 50-mL, round-bottomed flask which is pre-warmed to at least 50 \u00b0C to remove any insoluble material (Note 15). The flask is placed in the oil bath, which is allowed to cool slowly. When the temperature of the oil bath has reached 40 \u00b0C, the flask is scratched to induce crystallization (Note 16). The flask is then allowed to cool to room temperature, left at room temperature for 1 h and then cooled to 4 \u00b0C (refrigerator) for a further 14 h. The product is isolated by vacuum filtration through a fritted glass funnel (3 cm diameter, porosity 4). The crystals are washed with ice-cold heptane (2 \u00d7 5 mL) and then dried under vacuum (0.03 mmHg, 14 h) to afford pure 1-(2,2-dibromoethenyl)-2-nitrobenzene (5.95-6.11 g, 73-75 %) as a brown crystalline solid (Note 17).",

The flask is closed with a rubber septum, connected to a combined nitrogen/vacuum line via a 16-gauge needle, evacuated (22 \u00b0C, 0.4 mmHg) for 5 h in order to remove traces of water from the lithium salt, and filled with nitrogen. To this flask is added a solution of allyl methyl carbonate (8.52 mL, 8.71 g, 75.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (195 mL) (Note 4) over 5 min through a 16-gauge cannula (Note 5). The deep purple homogeneous solution is stirred at 22 \u00b0C for 1 h. In the course of stirring, the color changes to yellow. The resulting mixture is cooled down to -78 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath with stirring. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 3-cm egg-shaped magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper, a rubber septum fitted with the combined nitrogen/vacuum line via a 16-gauge needle, and a low-temperature thermometer via a thermometer adapter (Note 6). The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. To this flask, diisopropylamine (11.1 mL, 7.97 g, 78.7 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 7) is injected by syringe, and dry THF (75 mL) is added via a 16-gauge cannula.

The mixture is heated with an oil bath that is set to a temperature at which the solvent distills at a rate of 10 mL/hour (approximately 155 \u00b0C) (Note 4). The green mixture becomes homogeneous upon heating. After 7 h, the reaction is cooled to 25 \u00b0C and the residual solvent is concentrated at 65 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (20-25 mmHg) and then at 0.5 mmHg.

The flask is quickly opened to add 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (17.0 g, 105 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Notes 8 and 9) followed by acetonitrile (200 mL) (Note 10) via cannula. The white suspension is cooled with an ice bath and cyclohexanemethanol (3) (12.3 mL, 100 mmol) (Note 11) is transferred to the addition funnel using a syringe. Cyclohexanemethanol (3) is added dropwise over a 30-minute time period. Addition of the alcohol results in the suspension becoming a homogeneous solution. The addition funnel is rinsed with acetonitrile (10 mL) and the solution is stirred in the ice bath for 1 h. The reaction of cyclohexanemethanol 3 (Rf = 0.63 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole to give a carbonylated intermediate (Rf = 0.59 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) can be followed by TLC analysis using a potassium permanganate solution for visualization. Continued stirring does not improve the conversion as the intermediate can be hydrolyzed and the starting alcohol recovered. The solution is then warmed to ambient temperature. To the solution is then added hydroxylamine hydrochloride (20.9 g, 300 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 12) followed by imidazole (13.6 g, 200 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 12) and vigorous stirring is continued for 3.5 h (Note 13). The conversion of the intermediate (Rf = 0.59 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) to cyclohexylmethyl N-hydroxycarbamate 4 (Rf = 0.52 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) can be followed by TLC analysis using a potassium permanganate solution for visualization. The suspension is concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (130 mmHg) and at 0.5 mmHg.

Distilled water (75 mL) is added to the white suspension and the resulting clear mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. After vigorous shaking, the organic layer is separated and washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution (75 mL), dried over MgSO4 (15 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg and 20 mmHg) until the residue becomes solid and then at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h to afford a yellowish solid. The solid is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane and is charged on a 6.5 \u00d7 11 cm silica gel column (200 g of dry silica) (Note 20). The system is eluted with a mixture of 5% ethyl acetate-dichloromethane. The first 150 mL are discarded and the next 800 mL are collected in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg, then 20 mmHg) until the residue becomes a solid which is then dried at 0.5 mmHg. The inner surface of the flask is scratched with a spatula in order to loosen the product from the flask. To the 1-L flask is added a 6-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and 300 mL of hexane (Note 21). The suspension is vigorously stirred for 24 h and filtered on a fritted glass funnel. The white solid is dried at 0.5 mmHg for 8 h to afford 23.75 g (73% yield from 3) of the desired product (Notes 22 and 23).

A 1-L three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 6-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar is charged with dichloromethane (75 mL) and distilled water (10 mL). Potassium carbonate (7.60 g, 55 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 25) is added to the flask, which is fitted with a rubber septum, an internal thermometer, glass stopper and a short needle (through the septum) opened to the atmosphere, and the mixture is stirred until the white solid is dissolved. The dichloromethane solution containing 5 (Note 26) is taken up in a 60-mL glass syringe, which is installed on a syringe pump system set for an addition time of 60 minutes. Tetrakis(triphenylacetate) rhodium dimer (2) (0.678 g, 0.5 mmol, 0.01 equiv) is added to the biphasic solution and the dropwise addition is begun. Upon the addition of the tosyloxycarbamate 5 solution, the green reaction mixture becomes thicker, a white solid forms, and the internal temperature slowly rises to reach 30 \u00b0C when approximately half of the starting material is added. Then the mixture slowly cools down to room temperature. The starting material is added dropwise to avoid any significant rise of internal temperature. When the complete volume is added, the 250-mL flask and the syringe are rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane and this volume is added to the mixture which is stirred for a further 3 h to ensure complete consumption of the starting material. The dichloromethane is evaporated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg) until only the residue and the water are left in the flask. The aqueous residue is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and water (400 mL) and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The phases are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over MgSO4 (15 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (75 mmHg) and then at 0.5 mmHg to afford a yellowish solid. The solid is dissolved in 20 mL of dichloromethane and charged on a 6.5 \u00d7 22 cm column of silica gel (350 g of dry silica) (Note 20). The system is eluted with a mixture of 30% ethyl acetate-dichloromethane. Because the product is difficult to visualize by TLC, the first 900 mL are discarded and the next 1400 mL are collected and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg then 20 mmHg) until the residue solidifies. It is then dried at 0.5 mmHg to afford 6.1 g (79% yield) of the title compound as a yellowish solid of purity higher than 98% as determined by NMR and GC/MS analysis (Note 27)."

An additional 5 mL of CH2Cl2 are used to transfer the last traces of 1 to the reaction flask. After stirring for 2 h in the liquid nitrogen-ethyl acetate bath, the reaction mixture is quenched with a saturated solution of NH4Cl (80 mL). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, then transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered through a cotton plug under water aspirator pressure and concentrated using a rotary evaporator to afford a bright yellow oil (Note 5), a 95:5 ratio of diastereomers (Note 14). The crude product is dissolved in 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and loaded on a flash chromatography column of deactivated silica gel (6.5-cm diameter glass column and ca 450 g of silica) (Note 15). The column is eluted using a gradient solvent system of hexanes-CH2Cl2, 4:1 to 3:1 to 2:1. The fractions containing the desired product are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporator to afford 3.42 g (9.06 mmol, 89% yield) of 2 as a bright yellow oil (Notes 16, 17, 18).",

The flask is fitted with a rubber septum, flushed with nitrogen, and charged with anhydrous CH2Cl2 (10 mL, Note 10). The septum is temporarily removed and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (733 mg, 7.50 mmol, 1.53 equiv) (Note 19) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (610 mg, 5.0 mmol, 1.02 equiv) (Note 20) are quickly added. The septum is replaced, the flask is flushed again with nitrogen, and dry triethylamine (0.75 mL, 5.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 21) is added by syringe. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 h, over which period the initial deep yellow solution gradually fades to become almost colorless.

The organic layer is dried (MgSO4), filtered through a cotton plug under water aspirator pressure, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator to afford a yellowish oil (Note 5). The oily residue is dissolved in 2.5 mL of CH2Cl2 and charged on a column (4.1-cm diameter) of silica gel (ca 50 g) and eluted with 3:2 hexanes/EtOAc. The desired product is obtained in fractions 10-25 (ca 20 mL/fraction), which are concentrated by rotary evaporator (Note 5) to deliver 1.15 g (4.14 mmol, 83% yield) of (2R,3S,4E)-N,3-dimethoxy-N,2,4-trimethyl-5-phenyl-4-pentenamide (3) as a viscous colorless oil that solidifies upon standing in the refrigerator (Note 23). To recover the chiral auxiliary, the basic aqueous layer is treated with 2 M aqueous HCl (60 mL), and the resultant mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered through a cotton plug under water aspirator pressure, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Note 5) to afford the thiazolidine auxiliary (638 mg, 81%) as a yellowish solid (mp 67-68 \u00b0C) that can be reused."

The homogeneous, brown solution is then stirred at room temperature for 20 h and then heated to an internal temperature of 55 \u00b0C for 4 h (Notes 5 and 6). The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature. In a separate 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a temperature probe is added water (100 mL) and MTBE (100 mL) (Note 7) and this biphasic mixture is cooled in an ice bath to 0 - 5 \u00b0C. The above reaction mixture is then transferred to a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel and the reaction flask is rinsed with MTBE (15-25 mL). The crude reaction mixture is then added dropwise to the water/MTBE solution at such a rate that the internal temperature of the biphasic quench solution is maintained < 5 \u00b0C (Note 8). The mixture is then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the layers are allowed to separate. The organic layer is discarded. The yellow aqueous layer is washed with MTBE (60 mL). The aqueous layer is then made acidic (pH 1) by the addition of 6 N H2SO4 (15 mL, 2.40 equiv) (Note 9) and is extracted with EtOAc (100 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with an additional portion of EtOAc (60 mL) and the combined organic extracts (Note 10) are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to give a yellow oil. The oil is re-dissolved in MeOH (55 mL) (Note 11), a magnetic stir bar is placed in the flask and water (175 mL) is added dropwise to the stirred solution over 20 min. The yellow, crystalline slurry of the product is allowed to stir at room temperature for 45 min. The slurry is then filtered through a 150-mL fritted-glass funnel of medium porosity. The wet solid is washed with water (60 mL) and then dried under a vacuum/N2 sweep (Note 12) for 8 h to provide 2-[trans-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-vinyl]-3-nitrobenzoic acid 2 as a bright yellow powder (8.89-9.21 g, 83-86%) (Notes 13, 14).",

Oxalyl chloride (3.37 mL, 4.88 g, 38.5 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 16) is added via syringe through the septum followed by the addition of 2 drops of DMF (Note 17). The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h and then concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg). To the resulting crude, yellow acid chloride is added CH2Cl2 (25 mL) and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg).

The crude acid chloride is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (45 mL) and this solution is transferred to the addition funnel. The acid chloride is added dropwise to the stirred pyrrolidine solution at such a rate that the internal temperature is maintained < 23 \u00b0C. Upon completion of the addition of the acid chloride solution, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min (Note 5). The mixture is then diluted with 2 N HCl (60 mL) (Note 20) and is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the layers separated. The organic layer is washed with brine (60 mL) and is then concentrated under reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) (Note 10), diluted with MeOH (60 mL) and re-concentrated under reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to give a crude, yellow solid.

The resulting reaction vessel is inserted into a Rocker Assembly (Note 26) and purged with N2 (60 psi) three times (Note 27). The mixture is then purged with CO (60 psi) three times, (Note 28) and the final pressure set to 50 psi at continuous flow. The mixture is then heated to a jacket temperature of 80 \u00b0C and stirred at this temperature for 16 h (Note 5). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the system is vented to atmospheric pressure. The vessel is pressurized with N2 (60 psi) and vented three times to remove all residual amounts of CO. The reaction mixture is then filtered through 10 grams of Celite (Note 29) in a 150-mL fritted-glass funnel of medium porosity into a single-necked flask rinsing both the reaction flask and the filter cake with DMF (60 mL). To the yellowish-orange filtrate is added a stir bar and the flask is equipped with a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel.

The Schlenk flask is evacuated and back-filled with dry argon three times. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylacetamide (120 mL), 2-isobutylthiazole (4.25 mL, 30 mmol, 1.00 equiv), and chlorobenzene (4.5 mL, 45 mmol, 1.50 equiv) are added via a gas tight syringe (Note 1). Under a continuous flow of argon the rubber septum is quickly replaced with a reflux condenser and bubbler to ensure an air-free system. The mixture is stirred in a preheated oil bath at 125 \u00b0C for 36 h (Note 2). A continuous argon flow is maintained throughout the reaction. The yellow color of the reaction mixture changes to dark brown after 5-10 min of heating. Potassium phosphate does not dissolve and a mild reflux is observed. The conversion is monitored by GC (Note 3). If complete conversion is not achieved after 36 h, the reaction mixture is heated for an additional 2-4 h.",
            "After the reaction is complete as judged by GC analysis (Note 3), hydrazine hydrate (30 mL) is added in one portion and the flask is heated in an oil bath (125 \u00b0C) for 5 h (Note 4). At this point, the argon atmosphere is no longer required. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature followed by the addition of water (100 mL) and dichloromethane (50 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. Additional water (200 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL) are added to the separatory funnel. After separation of the organic layer, the water layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 150 mL) (Note 5). Magnesium sulfate (about 12 g) is directly placed in a 150-mL B\u00fcchner filter funnel with a medium porosity fritted disk. A round-bottomed flask (1-L) is connected to the filter funnel and the combined organic phase is filtered through the MgSO4 layer (Note 6). The combined organic extracts are not treated with MgSO4 beforehand. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 15 mm Hg). Following concentration, 120-130 mL of the crude product solution in DMA is left in the flask. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The solvent is removed by vacuum distillation (1.6 mm Hg) through a 4-cm column to a 200-mL round-bottomed receiver flask. The boiling point of DMA is 38-39 \u00b0C /1.6 mmHg; the temperature of the oil bath is kept at 65-70 \u00b0C (Note 7). After the distillation is complete the temperature inside the distillation apparatus drops to about 23 \u00b0C. The distillation residue is diluted with 10 mL of chromatography eluent mixture (hexanes/dichloromethane; 1/2). The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (5 \u00d7 19 cm, 200 g of silica gel) (Note 8), using hexanes/dichloromethane (1/2) as the eluent (900 mL). The first fractions are blank, followed by fractions containing minor amounts of impure and then pure product. The elution is continued with 5% ethyl acetate/dichloromethane (about 1.1 L collected). After concentration of the fractions containing pure product, the residue is dried under reduced pressure (1.0 mmHg) at room temperature for 24 h to yield the arylated heterocycle. The pure product (6.15 g, 94%) is obtained as an air stable, light brown oil (Notes 9 and 10)."

Once the internal temperature reaches 0 \u00b0C (20-30 minutes), an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (7.75 g of a 31.6% solution in H2O, 0.072 mol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 10) is added dropwise over a period of 25 min via the dropping funnel, keeping the internal temperature between 0-5 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture is then kept at 0 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and vigorously stirred for 16 h (Note 11).\nThe reaction is quenched at 0 \u00b0C by the addition of 10 % w/v aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (100 mL) added dropwise via the addition funnel and then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, rinsing with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 12). The layers are separated and the aqueous fraction is washed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic fractions are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (50 mL) and dried over magnesium sulfate (10 g). The solution is filtered, and the magnesium sulfate is washed with 100 mL CH2Cl2. The organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure (30\u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to give the crude product as a dark brown solid (13.83 g, Sample 1, Note 13). The solid is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (17 mL) and layered on a silica pad (50 g SiO2, Note 14) in a 7-cm diameter glass-sintered filter funnel (Note 15) and a mixture of sulfoxide and sulfone is eluted using EtOAc and petroleum ether (50:50, 200 mL) (Notes 16 and 17). The mixture is collected and evaporated under reduced pressure (3.37 g brown solid, Sample 2.1, Note 18). Elution with EtOAc (300 mL) and evaporation under reduced pressure gives pure sulfoxide as a pale yellow solid (9.3 g, Sample 2.2, 71% yield) (Note 19).\nColumn chromatography is performed on the mixed fraction Sample 2.1 (Note 20) and elution with a mixture of EtOAc and petroleum ether (50:50, 550 mL, until complete elution of ligand (S)-1 and sulfone) followed by EtOAc (1.4 L) and evaporation of the EtOAc fraction under reduced pressure gives pure sulfoxide as a yellow-brown solid (0.93 g, 7% yield, Sample 3) (Note 21).\nThe pure sulfoxide fractions, Samples 2.2 and 3, are combined in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in a mixture of hot EtOAc and heptane (20:80, 75 mL, Notes 22 and 23). Recrystallization occurs as the solution sits at room temperature (12 h, 25 \u00b0C), allowing for partial solvent evaporation (5 mL). Filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel gives the sulfoxide, which is dried under vacuum (0.02 mmHg) to afford off-white needles (8.07 g, 61%, Sample 4) (Note 24). Further purification is performed by sublimation of the solid at a pressure of 0.02 mmHg over a period of 4 h in a standard sublimation apparatus, with a water-cooled cold finger and with the external oil bath at 90 \u00b0C, which gives (S)-(-)-p-bromophenyl methyl sulfoxide as a white powder (8.07 g, 99 % ee, 61% yield) (Note 25)."

While stirring the reaction mixture, methyl acetoacetate (5.60 mL, 6.01 g, 51.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 4) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (15.7 mL, 19.3 g, 64.7 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 5) are added through the septum via syringes. The flask is submerged in an oil bath (100 \u00b0C) and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux (internal temperature: 78-81 \u00b0C, reached after 15 min). The mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 40 min (Note 6). Initially, the reaction mixture is a white opaque suspension, but during heating it changes color to yellow and upon reflux the color changes to orange. As the reaction progresses the opaque solution becomes transparent and the color changes back to yellow. Throughout the entire time a white precipitate is present in the flask. The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) over the course of 1 h. The flask is disconnected from the condenser and the nitrogen inlet, and the reaction mixture is diluted with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (200 mL) (Note 7). This mixture is carefully poured into a 1-L separatory funnel (Note 8). After the layers are separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (3 \u00d7 200 mL) (Notes 9 and 10). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (Note 11) and filtered (Note 12). Concentration of the dried organic layers is effected by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 45 mmHg) which affords an orange, viscous oil. Partial purification is achieved by flash chromatography (4.5 \u00d7 24 cm, 170 g silica gel) (Note 13) using a gradient of hexanes to 40% Et2O in hexanes. The crude product is loaded on the column with benzene (20 mL) (Note 14). Fraction collection (50 mL fractions) is begun as the crude product is eluted first with 100 mL of hexanes (Note 15), followed by 1500 mL of 9:1 hexanes:Et2O, 2000 mL of 4:1 hexanes:Et2O, 1000 mL of 7:3 hexanes:Et2O and finally 750 mL of 3:2 hexanes:Et2O. Fractions 38-85 are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30-35 \u00b0C, 45 mmHg) to afford 7.96 g (80%) of a slightly yellow solid (Note 16). The partially purified product is further purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 17) at 124-130 \u00b0C (0.75 mmHg) (Note 18) which affords 6.63 g (67%) of the title compound as an off-white, crystalline solid (Notes 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23)."

            "5-Chloro-3-ethoxycarbonylbenzofuran. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, thermometer, and a pennyhead stopper (Note 1). A 3-cm oval stir bar is added to the flask. 5-Chlorosalicylaldehyde (5.00 g, 31.9 mmol) (Note 2) is added to the flask along with 11 mL CH2Cl2 (Note 3) to form a thick white slurry, then 54% HBF4\u00b7OEt2 (0.50 g, 3.2 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 4) is added by syringe directly to the stirring solution through the neck containing the pennyhead stopper, whereby a color change from a white slurry to an orange slurry is noted. The pennyhead stopper is then replaced with a clean and dry 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with the Teflon stopcock closed (Note 5). Ethyl diazoacetate (90% pure) (5.79 g, 45.7 mmol, 1.43 equiv) is added to the addition funnel and diluted to 33 mL with dichloromethane (Notes 5-7). The EDA solution is then added to the reaction mixture at a rate of 5-7 mL per minute, resulting in steady evolution of nitrogen (total addition time was 5-7 minutes) and an increase in temperature from the initial 23 \u00b0C to 38 \u00b0C with a gentle reflux (Notes 5, 6 and 8). Once addition is complete gas evolution ceases within a minute and the reaction is assayed for completion by 1H NMR (Note 9). A heating mantle is placed under the round-bottomed flask. The equalizing addition funnel is replaced with a pennyhead stopper. At this point the solution is dark yellow in color. A simple distillation apparatus is assembled in place of the original reflux condenser using a distillation adapter, Claisen head adapter, and a 100-mL receiving flask. The reaction mixture is concentrated by distilling CH2Cl2 (30-33 mL) and free EDA to a maximum pot temperature of 58-61 \u00b0C leaving a clear yellow viscous oil. After removal of the heating mantle the solution is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, then 4.0 g of 95-98% H2SO4 (39.2 mmol) (Note 10) is added by syringe directly to the stirring viscous oil through the neck containing the pennyhead stopper over a period of 1-2 minutes. The addition is only slightly exothermic, with a temperature rise of about 5 \u00b0C using a water-cooling bath, and a color change from a clear yellow oil to a cloudy yellow-orange suspension is noted. After 10 minutes, the second step is complete and ready for neutralization. With water bath cooling and rapid agitation, the acidic reaction mixture is neutralized by slow addition of 100 mL saturated NaHCO3 solution (Note 11). The empty addition funnel is removed and replaced with a pennyhead stopper. The water bath is removed and replaced with a heating mantle. The aqueous mixture is azeotropically distilled, while maintaining high speed stirring in order to remove any trace of residual CH2Cl2 to a maximum pot temperature of 90 \u00b0C. Upon reaching 90 \u00b0C, the heating mantle is removed and the aqueous mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature while continuing to maintain rapid stirring (Note 12). After crystallizing overnight, the crude yellow solid product is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried to constant weight. The yield of crude material (~90% pure by NMR) is 5.99-6.08 g (84-86% uncorrected for purity).\nThe crude material is purified by recrystallization. To a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, stopper, and 100 mL addition funnel are added a 3-cm oval stir bar, 30 mL of anhydrous EtOH, in which 0.3 g of NaOH has been dissolved, and the crude product (5.97 g) (Note 13). The mixture is stirred with warming to 35 \u00b0C in order to dissolve the product, then 70 mL of deionized water is added dropwise from the addition funnel over 15 min. The product begins to crystallize after 10 mL water is added. On completion of the water addition, the mixture is stirred for 5 min at room temperature, then filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel and filter paper. The flask is washed with 2 \u00d7 15 mL of deionized water and the washes are then used to rinse the crystalline product on the B\u00fcchner funnel. The crystalline product is allowed to dry on the B\u00fcchner funnel for 30 min to 1 h to provide 4.84 g (68%) of product as a tan, free-flowing solid (Note 14)."

The mixture is stirred vigorously to create a uniform suspension, and 297 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (1.57 mmol, 0.005 equiv) is added. A Dean-Stark trap and a water-cooled condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 2) are affixed to the flask, and the resulting suspension is heated to reflux (120 \u00b0C oil bath temperature). The mixture in the flask soon became homogeneous. After 16 h at reflux, approximately 11 mL of water had accrued in the Dean-Stark trap. The vessel is cooled to ambient temperature and the solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL). The organic solution is washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 \u00d7 15 mL) and brine (2 \u00d7 15 mL) and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (6 g).

Once the starting material is consumed (based on TLC, Note 5), 24.3 mL of neat iodomethane (391 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 1) is added to the mixture, which became a white suspension. After an additional 15 h at 40 \u00b0C, the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature (22 \u00b0C) and water (60 mL) is added carefully via syringe over the course of 9 min to obtain a clear, yellowish solution. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, the THF is removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg) (Note 6), and the remaining solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL).

At this point, the semicarbazone is found to have 90\u201391% ee (measured by reverting to the ketone, Note 20).\nA stir bar is added to the flask and the solids are suspended in 150 mL of toluene with mixing at approximately 400 rpm. After a water-cooled reflux condenser is attached to the flask, the mixture is then heated to 110 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in an oil bath. After a few minutes at this temperature, the solids dissolve completely to afford a clear colorless solution (Note 21). Heating is discontinued and the stirred mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature (20 \u00b0C) overnight while still immersed in the oil bath (Note 22). The cooled heterogeneous mixture is vacuum filtered (water aspirator) through filter paper on a porcelain B\u00fcchner funnel. The solids are rinsed with toluene (2 \u00d7 10 mL) and then dried on the filter for 15 min (Note 23). The solids are transferred to a 250-mL pear-shaped flask and dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) until a constant mass of 10.8\u201310.9 g (51.7\u201352.2 mmol, 76\u201377% yield, 89\u201390% recovery) is observed. This material is found to have 98\u201399% enantiomeric excess (measured by reverting to the ketone, Note 20).\nA 250-mL pear-shaped flask containing a magnetic stir bar and 10.5 g of semicarbazone (50.2 mmol) and 40 mL of diethyl ether is stirred to suspend the solids. To the suspension is added 20 mL of 3 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (Note 1). No appreciable heat evolution is observed. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 h at ambient temperature (20 \u00b0C), at which time all of the solids had disappeared and two clear colorless phases are observed. The biphasic mixture is transferred to a 100-mL separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The combined organic layers are then washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 \u00d7 5 mL), water (1 \u00d7 5 mL), and brine (2 \u00d7 5 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (1 g) and then filtered through cotton and concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (150 mmHg, first at 20 \u00b0C, then at 40 \u00b0C to remove the last traces of solvent) to provide 7.62\u20137.63 g (50.1\u201350.2 mmol, >99% yield) of (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone of 98% ee (Notes 14 and 15). GC analysis demonstrates the product is formed in >99% product purity (Note 24)."

Acetyl chloride (5.3 mL, 75 mmol) (Note 9) is added via syringe over a period of 1 h using a syringe pump; during the addition the flask is placed in a 25 \u00b0C water bath to control the heat evolved during the reaction. During the addition the reaction turns cloudy, then a yellow-orange precipitate forms. Stirring is continued for an additional 6 h after which time the heterogeneous mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel connected to a vacuum from a water aspirator. The precipitate is washed with pentane (50 mL) and the filtrate is concentrated to ca. 50 mL (Note 10) at 0 \u00b0C on a rotary evaporator (20-25 mmHg). Pentane (150 mL) and an egg-shaped magnetic stir bar are added to the residue-containing flask and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min. The white precipitate (triphenylphosphine oxide) is removed by filtering the mixture through a B\u00fcchner funnel and washing the precipitate with pentane (50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 30 mL at 0 \u00b0C on a rotary evaporator (20-25 mmHg). The residue is filtered again to remove the precipitate (triphenylphosphine oxide) and the precipitate is rinsed with pentane (10 mL). The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 20 mL as described above (Note 11).

Through the other septum is inserted a 6-mm glass tube which is connected to the reaction flask via vacuum tubing. This empty flask serves as a trap to prevent backflow of the flask contents into the lecture bottle.\nA trap to neutralize discharged ammonia gas is also constructed as follows. To a 3-necked, 1-L flask is added 400 mL of 10% HCl, which is gently stirred using a magnetic stir bar (3 cm).

An exotherm of about 5 \u00b0C occurs over 10 min. The reaction is stirred for 5 h at 21-22 \u00b0C, during which time the solution changes from yellow to a pale orange (Note 18). The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath), and the resulting residue is purified by column chromatography over silica gel (Note 19) to afford 6.07 g (70%) of 2-[(S)-(3-benzyl-ureido)-phenyl-methyl]-3-oxo-butyric acid methyl ester (Note 20) as a pale yellow oil.",

Into a dedicated 20-mL one-necked Pyrex microwave process vial equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (Note 1), 10 mL of dry ethanol (Note 2), triethylamine (981 \u03bcL, 712 mg, 7.04 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 3), 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-amine (700 mg, 4.40 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) and 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (617 mg, 4.40 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added and stirred vigorously for 2 min at room temperature to form a slightly brownish solution. p-Tolualdehyde (519 \u03bcL, 529 mg, 4.40 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6) is then added. The reaction vial is tightly sealed with a Teflon septum inserted into an aluminum crimp (Note 7) and transferred to a Biotage single-mode microwave reactor for microwave processing at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes 8 and 9). After the reaction mixture has been processed, the vial is cooled down to 50 \u00b0C using the gas-jet cooling feature of the instrument (5 min) and subsequently removed from the microwave cavity by the robotic arm. After decrimping of the sealed process vial, the dark yellow reaction mixture is quickly transferred into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask filled with 200 mL of water at room temperature under vigorous stirring, resulting in a bright yellow turbid suspension. The pH of the reaction mixture is brought to ca. 2 by careful addition of 7 mL of 6M HCl within ca. 1 min, which leads to the formation of a yellow precipitate. After stirring for an additional 60 min at room temperature the precipitate is collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel with a coarse glass frit and then is triturated with water (3 \u00d7 20 mL) by turning off the vacuum, adding the solvent, crushing the solid and mixing thoroughly with a spatula, and then turning on the vacuum to remove the solvent. The product is subsequently dried overnight in a drying oven at 50 \u00b0C under vacuum. For purification the crude product is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel with a medium glass frit and triturated with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 20 mL), applying gentle suction to remove the filtrate after each trituration. The solid is then dried for 1 h in a drying oven at 50 \u00b0C under vacuum to yield 1.19-1.22 g of pale yellow powdery solid. The solid is then transferred to a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and the flask is heated to 90 \u00b0C, adding 25-26 mL of EtOH slowly until the solid is dissolved. The hot solution is then quickly filtered (hot filtration) by suction filtration through filter paper on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 10). The clear yellow solution is reheated in the 90 \u00b0C oil bath, and then the heat and magnetic stirring are turned off and the solution is allowed to slowly cool to room temperature and crystallize overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 2 \u00d7 1 mL of EtOH, and dried overnight in a drying oven at 50 \u00b0C under vacuum to provide 0.78-0.85 g (46-50%) of 7,7-dimethyl-3-phenyl-4-p-tolyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-5(4H)-one (1) as yellow crystals in 99% purity (Notes 11 and 12).",

Into a dedicated 20-mL one-necked Pyrex microwave process vial equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (Note 1), 10 mL of acetonitrile (Note 13), 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-amine (1.39 g, 8.74 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Notes 4 and 14) and 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (1.23 g, 8.74 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added and stirred vigorously for 1 min at room temperature to form a yellow suspension. Chlorotrimethylsilane (222 \u03bcL, 190 mg, 1.75 mmol, 0.40 equiv) (Note 15) is added, sometimes resulting in the formation of a white precipitate that dissolves upon stirring. After an additional stirring period of 1 min at room temperature, p-tolualdehyde (515 \u03bcL, 525 mg, 4.37 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6) is added, whereupon the suspension turns into a yellow solution. The checkers noted that a small amount of solid sometimes remains undissolved. The formed reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 2 min and then the reaction vial is tightly sealed with a Teflon septum inserted into an aluminum crimp (Note 7) and transferred to a Biotage single-mode microwave reactor for microwave processing at 170 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes 16 and 17). After the reaction mixture has been processed, the vial is cooled down to 50 \u00b0C using the gas-jet cooling feature of the instrument (ca. 5 min) and is subsequently removed from the microwave cavity by the robotic arm. After decrimping of the sealed process vial, the dark orange reaction mixture is quickly transferred into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 300 mL of a vigorously stirred ethanol-water-NaOH mixture (Note 18) to adjust the pH to 8-9. The resulting suspension is stirred for an additional 2 h and is then collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel with a coarse glass frit and triturated with a H2O/EtOH mixture (2:1, 3 \u00d7 20 mL) by turning off the vacuum, adding the solvent, crushing the solid and mixing thoroughly with a spatula, and then turning on the vacuum to remove the solvent. The precipitate is dried overnight in a drying oven at 50 \u00b0C under vacuum. The crude product is then transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of acetonitrile and stirred vigorously for 10 min to break up the solid into a fine suspension. The stirring mixture is then heated to boiling for 5 min, allowing the desired product to dissolve while leaving a side product suspended as a white solid. The hot mixture is then filtered through a medium glass-fritted B\u00fcchner funnel, applying gentle suction to assist in the filtration. The clear yellow filtrate is reheated to boiling, and 100 mL of boiling water is added. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring for 1 h, then the flask is placed in an ice bath and stirring is continued for an additional 1 h. During the recrystallization of product 2, the solution becomes cloudy within 1-2 min after adding the boiling water, and crystallization proceeds as the solution begins to cool. The resulting white solid is collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel with a coarse glass frit, washed with 2 \u00d7 10 mL of a cold (0 \u00b0C) acetonitrile/H2O mixture (1:1) and dried overnight in a vacuum drying oven at 50 \u00b0C to provide 1.22-1.28 g (73-76%) of 6,6-dimethyl-2-phenyl-9-p-tolyl-5,6,7,9-tetrahydropyrazolo[5,1-b]quinazolin-8(4H)-one (2) as a white fibrous solid (Notes 19 and 20)."

A 25-mL Dean-Stark trap topped with a reflux condenser, fitted with an argon adapter, is attached to the reaction vessel and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux using a heating mantle until L(-)-proline is no longer visibly suspended and consumption is observed by reverse phase TLC (Note 5). Heating is discontinued and the volatile organics are removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 20-25 mmHg). The resulting brown, crystalline solid is recrystallized from ethanol. Boiling ethanol (30 mL) is added to the crude residue in the reaction flask warmed to 50 \u00b0C (bath temperature).

The suspension is heated at reflux for 3 h in an oil bath at 47 \u00b0C. During this time, a constant evolution of HCl gas is observed while all solid materials dissolve and the solution develops an intense yellow to orange-red color. After reaching ambient temperature, the reflux condenser is replaced by a short path distillation head (10 cm) and all volatile materials are distilled off under reduced pressure (10 mmHg, bath temperature ca. 40 \u00b0C) to give 1,3-dichloro-1,3-bis(dimethylamino)-propenium chloride as bright yellow, air-sensitive crystals that are dried in vacuo (10\u22123 mmHg).

The flask is immersed into a dry ice/acetone cooling bath at \u221278 \u00baC.\nThe volume of 23 mL is clearly marked on the outside of a one-necked Schlenk tube (50 mL, 15 cm length) (Note 4) equipped with a glass stopper and connected to the argon/vacuum line via its side arm. The flask is flame dried in vacuo (0.3 mmHg), back-filled with argon, and allowed to reach ambient temperature. The glass stopper is replaced by a gas inlet and the flask is immersed into a dry ice/acetone bath. Dimethylamine (ca. 23-26 mL, 350-390 mmol, 8 equiv) (Note 1) is then gently condensed from a commercial cylinder into the flask (Note 5). By applying slight argon overpressure, the condensed dimethylamine is rapidly (< 1 min) transferred via a teflon tube (2 mm diameter) into the round-bottomed flask containing the chilled 1,3-dichloro-1,3-bis(dimethylamino)propenium chloride. The resulting mixture is vigorously stirred for 1 h at \u221278 \u00b0C and for 1 h at \u221220 \u00b0C using an external thermometer in a dry ice/acetone bath. During this time, the yellow solid disappears and a white precipitate is formed. The suspension is then warmed to room temperature, allowing the excess dimethylamine to evaporate through the argon bubbler (Note 6). The remaining white solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL), and the resulting solution transferred into a separation funnel (250 mL) and washed with a saturated solution of NaBF4 (4 \u00d7 40 mL) (Note 1).

The cold finger is filled with a mixture of dry ice/acetone and the flask is immersed into a dry ice/acetone cooling bath (\u221278 \u00b0C) before dry ammonia (ca. 40 mL) (Note 9) is condensed into the flask. The cooling bath is removed, causing the ammonia to reflux back from the cold finger kept at \u221278 \u00b0C into the reaction mixture. After 1 hour, the cooling of the condenser is discontinued such that the ammonia gently evaporates while the reaction mixture reaches room temperature (Note 10).

A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with iminodiacetic acid (1) (100.5 g, 755.2 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2) and formalin (84.5 mL, 92.1 g, 1.13 mol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 3) to give an off-white suspension. The flask is then fitted with a water-cooled Friedrichs condenser in the center neck, a 125-mL addition funnel (Note 4) containing formic acid (57.0 mL, 69.5 g, 1.51 mol, 2.00 equiv) (Note 5) in a side neck, and a thermometer in the other side neck. The stirred reaction mixture is brought to reflux (90 \u00b0C) using a heating mantle, and then maintained at reflux with stirring for 30 min. After 30 min the formic acid is added dropwise over 20 min (approx 3 mL/min) (Note 6). During this time, the reaction mixture becomes clear and yellow. The addition funnel stop-cock is then closed and the solution is allowed to reflux for one hour. At the end of one hour the heat source is removed and the solution is allowed to cool with stirring to 23 \u00b0C over one hour. The Friedrichs condenser, addition funnel, and thermometer are then removed and the reaction mixture is poured into a 4000-mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a large PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar. Deionized water (2 \u00d7 25 mL) is used to quantitatively transfer the contents of the reaction mixture to the Erlenmeyer flask. To the stirred reaction mixture is then added absolute ethanol (750 mL) dropwise over one hour (approx 12.5 mL/min) (Note 7) leading to the precipitation of a colorless, crystalline powder. The precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration. The 4000-mL Erlenmeyer flask is then rinsed with absolute ethanol (4 \u00d7 200 mL), with each washing being poured over the collected precipitate. The precipitate is then washed with absolute ethanol (200 mL). The precipitate is allowed to air dry under vacuum suction for 10 min. The solid is then transferred to a tared 500-mL round-bottomed flask and residual solvent is removed under reduced pressure (23 \u00baC, 1 mmHg) for 12 h to give the title compound as a free-flowing, air-stable, white powder (98.30 g, 668.1 mmol, 88% yield) (Note 8).",
            "B. 4-Bromophenylboronic MIDA ester (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 4-bromophenylboronic acid (3) (24.99 g, 124.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 9) and methyliminodiacetic acid (2) (18.31 g, 124.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv). To the flask is then added a freshly prepared 5% (v/v) solution of dimethyl sulfoxide in toluene (125 mL) (Note 10) to afford a white solid suspended in a clear, colorless solution. The flask is then fitted with a toluene-filled Dean-Stark trap topped with a water-cooled Friedrichs condenser (Note 11) and the stirred reaction mixture is brought to reflux using a heating mantle. The reaction mixture is allowed to reflux with stirring for 6 h, during which time the reaction remains heterogeneous, but darkens in color, giving a tan solid suspended in a clear, colorless solution. Approximately 2.1 mL of water was collected in the Dean-Stark trap. The heating mantle is removed, and the reaction is allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C with stirring for one hour. The Dean-Stark trap and magnetic stir bar are removed (Note 12) and the reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) (Note 13) to afford the crude product as a tan, chunky solid.\nAcetone (15 mL) (Note 14) is then added and the flask is swirled vigorously to afford a white solid suspended in a clear tan solution. To this mixture is added diethyl ether (150 mL) (Note 15) in 25-mL portions. After the addition of each portion the flask is swirled gently causing the precipitation of additional white solid. The white solid is collected via vacuum filtration on a 150-mL medium-porosity glass frit. The collected product is then washed with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL) and is allowed to dry for 5 min under vacuum suction (Note 16). The product is then transferred to a tared 250-mL round-bottomed flask and residual solvent is removed at reduced pressure (23 \u00baC, 1 mmHg) for 4 h to give 4-bromophenylboronic acid MIDA ester as a free-flowing, air-stable, white powder (36.30 g, 116.4 mmol, 94% yield) (Note 17).",

An oven-dried, 500-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged with palladium (II) acetate (361 mg, 1.61 mmol, 0.020 equiv) and (2-biphenyl)-dicyclohexylphosphine (1.160 g, 3.310 mmol, 0.041 equiv) (Note 18) and then quickly sealed with a rubber septum and placed under an inert atmosphere through five cycles of evacuation (1 mmHg) and purging with dry argon (Note 19). Tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) is then cannulated into the 500-mL Schlenk flask resulting in a clear, pale yellow-orange solution (Note 20). Under positive argon pressure the rubber septum is removed and replaced with an oven-dried water-cooled Graham condenser topped with an oven-dried hose barb adapter. Argon is allowed to flow through the system for 60 seconds at which point an argon inlet is attached to the hose barb and the Schlenk valve is closed. The reaction vessel is lowered into an oil bath preheated to 70 \u00b0C and the solution is allowed to reflux with stirring for 20 min, during which time the catalyst solution turns colorless. The heating bath is then removed and the catalyst solution is allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C over 10 min. The Schlenk valve is reopened and under a positive argon pressure the Graham condenser is replaced with a rubber septum and the head space is purged for 60 sec through a 20G (1.5 inch) vent needle.\nIn parallel with the catalyst preparation, an oven-dried, 2000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with an oven-dried water-cooled Graham condenser topped with a hose-barb adapter in the center neck and a rubber septa on each side neck is charged with 4 (25.00 g, 80.15 mmol, 1 equiv), p-tolylboronic acid (16.39 g, 120.6 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 21), and freshly-ground, anhydrous potassium phosphate (51.06 g, 240.5 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 22). The reaction flask is then quickly placed under inert atmosphere (through the condenser top) through five cycles of evacuation (1 mmHg) and purging with dry argon. Tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) is then added into the 2000-mL flask through one of the side necks (Note 23) by syringe, resulting in a white suspension.\nThe catalyst solution is then cannulated into the 2000-mL reaction flask with stirring resulting in a yellow suspension. The reaction flask is lowered into an oil bath preheated to 70 \u00b0C and allowed to reflux with stirring for 6 h. The heat source is then removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool for 20 min with stirring. The Graham condenser and septa are removed from the flask necks and the reaction is quenched with 1000 mL saturated ammonium chloride (Note 24) giving a biphasic mixture comprised of a clear colorless bottom layer and a clear yellow top layer. This mixture is poured into a 4000-mL separatory funnel. The reaction mixture is quantitatively transferred to the separatory funnel with a freshly prepared THF:diethyl ether (1:1) solution (2 \u00d7 200-mL). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with THF:diethyl ether (1:1) solution (400 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (150 mL) (Note 25), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered through Celite. The solvent is removed via rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Residual solvent is removed at reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg) to afford the crude product as a yellow solid. Acetone (120 mL) is added to the crude product and the resulting mixture is swirled vigorously to give a yellow slurry. Diethyl ether (800 mL) is then added in 4 equal portions with swirling to give an off-white precipitate in a clear yellow solution. The precipitate is collected via vacuum filtration and allowed to air dry over vacuum for 5 minutes. The solid is transferred to a tared 100-mL round-bottomed flask and residual solvent is removed at reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg) to give the title compound as a free-flowing, air stable, off-white powder (19.86 g, 61.46 mmol, 77% yield).\nTo this solid is then added acetone (100 mL) and the thin slurry is heated with stirring at 60 \u00b0C until the volume is reduced to 60 mL. Diethyl ether (400 mL) is then added in 4 equal portions with swirling to give a white precipitate in a clear light yellow solution. The precipitate is collected via vacuum filtration and allowed to air dry over vacuum for 5 min. The solid is then transferred to a tared 100-mL round-bottomed flask and residual solvent is removed under reduced pressure (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg) to give the title compound as a free-flowing, air stable, white powder (17.30 g, 53.53 mmol, 67% yield) (Note 26).",

Formic acid (3.10 mL, 3.68 g, 80.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added. The flask is loosely fitted with a rubber septum and the white, opaque, biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature (23 \u00b0C). After a couple of hours the water phase becomes clear. The product 1 is formed as yellow chunks, which become more dispersed in the water phase as the reaction proceeds. After 3 days (Note 6) of stirring the suspension is vacuum filtered (Note 7). The yellow chunks are crushed with a spatula, and the product is triturated with H2O (2 \u00d7 10 mL) and Et2O (2 \u00d7 10 mL) (Note 8). After each trituration the solvent is removed by vacuum filtration.

An oven-dried (Note 12), 250-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask with a magnetic stir bar is equipped with a vacuum adaptor in the middle neck and glass stoppers in the two other necks (one of which is loosely fitted to allow an outflow of nitrogen gas). The adaptor is connected to a nitrogen gas line (Note 13) and the flask is purged with nitrogen as it is allowed to cool to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). The flask is then charged with [RhCl(cod)]2 (247 mg, 0.50 mmol, 0.025 equiv) (Note 14) and (R,R)-deguPHOS (583 mg, 1.1 mmol, 0.055 equiv) (Note 15) by removing one of the glass stoppers. A septum is used to seal the flask and the other glass stopper is exchanged with an adaptor equipped with a thermometer. The flask is then purged with nitrogen for 5 min and a positive nitrogen flow is thereafter maintained to ensure an oxygen-free atmosphere inside the flask (Note 16). Dry dioxane (80 mL) (Note 17) is added through the septum via a syringe and the flask is submerged into an oil bath (70 \u00b0C), and the mixture is stirred for 1 h (internal temperature: 65 \u00b0C, reached after 20 min). Initially, the precatalyst is not fully soluble in dioxane, but as the preincubation proceeds it completely dissolves.

A septum is used to seal the flask, and the other glass stopper is exchanged with an adaptor equipped with a thermometer. The flask is then purged with nitrogen for 5 min, and a positive nitrogen inflow is maintained to ensure an oxygen-free atmosphere inside the flask. Dry dioxane (240 mL) is added through the septum via a syringe immediately before the preincubation is complete (described above). Additionally, dry triethylamine (4.20 mL, 3.04 g, 30.00 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 24) is added via a syringe.

The flask is immersed in an oil bath equipped with an external thermometer. An inert atmosphere is maintained during the course of the reaction. Anhydrous acetonitrile (50 mL) (Note 1) is added through the rubber septum via the repeated use of a 20-mL syringe. Benzaldehyde (5.71 mL, 6.0 g, 57 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) is then added through the rubber septum using both a five-mL and a one-mL syringe. Pyrrolidine (5.66 mL, 4.82 g, 68 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) is added next by a five-mL syringe followed by a solution of tert-butyl hydroperoxide in decane (12.4 mL, 62-74 mmol, 1.09-1.30 equiv) (Notes 4 and 5) using a 10-mL syringe. While maintaining a positive nitrogen pressure, the rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper. After stirring for 5 min, the yellow reaction mixture is heated in the oil bath to 70 \u00b0C for 6 h, and the reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Notes 6 and 7). Upon complete consumption of benzaldehyde, the flask is removed from the oil bath and the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is tested for the presence of peroxides using starch-KI paper, which indicated the absence of peroxides. The solution is then diluted with 100 mL of water and transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The reaction flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 10 mL), and the rinses are transferred to the 500-mL flask. The resulting mixture is concentrated to approximately two-thirds of its initial volume by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg). The concentrated solution is then transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with dichloromethane (4 \u00d7 40 mL).

The septum is temporarily removed and the apparatus is purged with nitrogen for 5 min and then the flask is charged with 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride 1 (5.16 g, 21.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Notes 1 and 2), tert-butanol (2.11 mL, 21.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3), water (15 mL) (Note 4), and toluene (40 mL) (Note 5) at room temperature. The septum is replaced and the mixture is stirred at 120 rpm, and the resulting biphasic solution is cooled to -5 \u00b0C (internal temperature) in an ice/salt bath over which time the aqueous layer freezes to become a white slurry in the organic layer. The addition funnel is charged with 5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30.9 mL, 25.1 mmol, 1.15 equiv, Note 6), which is then added dropwise over 30 min to the reaction mixture, maintaining the internal temperature between -5 and 0 \u00b0C. Once the addition is complete, stirring is continued at this temperature for a further 15 min (Note 7). Once the mixture reaches >15 \u00b0C, it is transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel (washing with 2 \u00d7 10 mL of toluene). The layers are separated and the lower, aqueous layer is discarded. The colorless organic layer is washed with water (1 \u00d7 15 mL), and then with brine (1 \u00d7 15 mL) (Note 8). The organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, keeping the bath temperature below 30 \u00b0C) to a volume of approximately 12 mL (Note 9). A stir bar is added, and to the stirred toluene solution is then added n-heptane (40 mL) (Note 10) dropwise via an addition funnel over 20 min at room temperature, and the resulting white slurry is then cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath and stirred at that temperature for a further 3 h. The crystalline product is then collected by filtration through a 60-mL fritted-glass funnel of medium porosity.

            "Paraformaldehyde (30 g, 1.0 mol) (Note 1) is added to a 250-mL round-bottomed flask, open to air, which is cooled with an ice bath. With vigorous stirring, morpholine (88 mL, 1.0 mol) (Note 2) is added dropwise over 1 h via addition funnel. The addition must be performed slowly with cooling because the reaction is exothermic. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed (Note 3), and with stirring, the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2 h (Note 4). The round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the reaction mixture is heated at 60 \u00baC in an oil bath for 10 h (Note 5). A clear and viscous solution (107 mL) containing morpholinomethanol as well as other species is formed. The product is verified by 1H and 13C NMR analyses and the concentration of morpholinomethanol in the solution is determined to be 2.3 M (Notes 6-8).\nTo a 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask is added (S)-5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'-octahydro-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol [(S)-H8BINOL, 5.0 g, 17.0 mmol] (Note 9). One neck of the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser which is fitted with a vacuum adaptor connected to a Schlenk line. The second neck of the flask is fitted with a glass stopper. The third neck is fitted with a thermometer to monitor the internal temperature. The flask is then evacuated (5 \u00d7 10-3 mmHg) and subsequently refilled with nitrogen (Note 10). This process is conducted three times. Maintaining a positive pressure of nitrogen, the glass stopper is then replaced with a rubber septum. To the flask is added 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) via syringe (Note 11).\nThe solution containing morpholinomethanol (Note 12) is bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min to remove any dissolved oxygen and then is transferred via cannula through the septum to the reaction flask containing (S)-H8BINOL (Note 13). While maintaining a positive pressure of nitrogen, the septum is replaced with a glass stopper. The reaction flask is then heated in an oil bath for 18 h to maintain the internal temperature at 60 \u00b0C. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) shows complete consumption of the starting material, (S)-H8BINOL (Note 14).\nAfter allowing the flask to cool to room temperature, the reaction mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) in a 500-mL separatory funnel (Note 15). The organic layer is washed with a saturated NaHCO3 solution (3 \u00d7 100 mL) and distilled water (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The organic layer is then dried with sodium sulfate (20 g) (Note 16), filtered, and transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed via rotary evaporation (30 \u00baC, 10 mmHg) to yield a white solid.\nThe compound is purified via crystallization in ethanol. Hot ethanol (600 mL) is added to the 1-L round-bottomed flask to dissolve the product (Note 17). The solution is cooled to room temperature (Note 18), and then further cooled at -18 \u00b0C in a laboratory freezer for 44 h. Vacuum filtration (Note 19) with a B\u00fcchner funnel gives 7.48 g of (S)-1 (90% yield) as white, fluffy, needle-like crystals (Notes 20-22). (S)-1 is obtained with >99% ee and 99% purity as demonstrated by HPLC analysis (Note 23)."

            "An oven-dried 500-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask, stir bar, glass stopper, septum and vacuum adaptor containing a stopcock are taken into a glove box (Note 1). The flask is charged with lithium acetylacetonate (0.771 g, 7.27 mmol, 0.25 equiv) (Note 2), sealed, and brought outside of the glove box and into a fume hood. The vacuum adaptor is connected to a Schlenk line, and the flask is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 3).\n1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, 48 mL) (Note 4) and 3-iodoanisole (7.62 mL, 64.0 mmol, 2.2 equiv) (Note 5) are added sequentially through the septum via syringe. The reaction flask is cooled to 0 \u00baC with an ice bath, and diethylzinc (3.65 mL, 34.9 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 6) is added via syringe. The pale yellow reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00baC for 12 h.\n(S)-3,3'-Bis-morpholinomethyl-5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'-octahydro-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol [(S)-1] (Note 7) is dried prior to use in catalysis. An oven-dried 100-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a stir bar is connected to a Schlenk line, fitted with a glass stopper and cooled under vacuum. Under positive nitrogen pressure, the flask is then charged with (S)-1 (1.43 g, 2.91 mmol, 0.1 equiv) and then 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added (Note 8). After the resulting solution is stirred for 30 min, the solvent is removed under vacuum (Note 9). While maintaining a positive flow of pressure, the glass stopper is exchanged for a rubber septum. To the dried ligand is added 80 mL of THF via syringe.\nThe THF solution of (S)-1 is transferred via cannula into the reaction flask which is maintained at 0 \u00baC in an ice bath. To ensure that the entire amount of (S)-1 is transferred, an additional 40 mL of THF is added via syringe to the Schlenk flask and then cannula-transferred into the reaction flask. A final 40 mL of THF is added to the round-bottomed flask via syringe, and the reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00baC.\nAfter 1 h, the reaction flask is warmed to room temperature for 15 min. Cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (3.50 mL, 29.1 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 10) is then added via syringe. The pale yellow reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature.\nAfter 16 h, the reaction is determined to be complete by TLC (Note 11) and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (Note 12). The reaction mixture is then transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask, and most of the organic solvent is removed via rotary evaporation (20 \u00baC, 10 mmHg). The remaining aqueous layer is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and diluted with 200 mL of diethyl ether and an additional 75 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. After shaking, the organic layer is collected, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are then washed with water (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate (15 g) (Note 13), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00baC, 10 mmHg to give a non-viscous yellow oil.\nThis oil is loaded on a coarse-fritted column (5 \u00d7 25.4 cm) of SiO2 (170 g) (Note 14). The round-bottomed flask is then rinsed with methylene chloride (10 mL) to ensure that all of the extract is loaded onto the column. The column is eluted as follows: hexanes (1 L), 3% EtOAc/hexanes (1 L), 4% EtOAc/hexanes (500 mL), 5% EtOAc/hexanes (3.5 L). Fraction collection (25 mL fractions) is begun after addition of the second 500 mL portion of 3% EtOAc/hexanes. The product begins to elute at 4% ethyl acetate/hexanes as determined by TLC analysis, and collection is continued until the product is no longer visible by TLC. Due to tailing the product eluted over 3 liters of solvent. Consequently, after 25 fractions of 25 mL that contained product are collected, 500 mL fractions are next collected until no more product is eluted out (Note 15). The desired product is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00baC, 10 mmHg) and dried overnight under vacuum (5 \u00d7 10-3 mmHg) to yield 5.91 g (92%) of (R)-(+)-\u03b1-cyclohexyl-3-methoxybenzenemethanol as a white solid (mp 62-65 \u00baC) (Notes 16 and 17). HPLC analysis demonstrates that the product is obtained with >99% ee and >99% purity (Note 18)."

A modest flow of argon is applied as judged by the exit bubbler (1-2 bubbles per second) and the reaction is kept under argon during the entire procedure. The glass stopper is removed and dry DABCO (5.40 g, 48.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 4) is added in one portion using a powder funnel (Note 5). The open joint is sealed with a rubber septum and dry deoxygenated toluene (30 mL) (Note 6) is added via syringe. The solution is stirred for 10 min until all DABCO has dissolved (Note 7) and the rubber septum is replaced by a 0-150 \u00b0C thermometer in a gas-tight adaptor. The dropping funnel is charged with 2 m trimethylaluminum in toluene (47.0 mL, 94.0 mmol, 1.95 equiv) (Note 8) using a syringe. The trimethylaluminum solution is then added to the DABCO solution over 25 min at room temperature (Note 9) causing the formation of a white precipitate after ca. 10 min. Residual trimethylaluminum in the dropping funnel is rinsed with additional dry deoxygenated toluene (3 mL) (Note 6). The solution is stirred for 30 min at room temperature before DABAL-Me3 (1) is allowed to settle for ca. 10 min. The dropping funnel is replaced by a rubber septum (Note 10, 11) and the toluene is removed by cannular filtration (Note 12). The colorless DABAL-Me3 (1) is washed by injection of dry deoxygenated diethyl ether (40 mL) (Note 13), brief stirring and removal of the solvent by cannular filtration. This procedure is repeated twice (2 \u00d7 40 mL of dry deoxygenated diethyl ether). The product is dried under high vacuum (0.05 mmHg) at room temperature to afford DABAL-Me3 (1) (9.97 g, 38.9 mmol, 81%) (Notes 14, 15) as a colorless solid.",
            "B. Ethyl 4-methylbenzoate (2). A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an egg-shaped, teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar (ca. 25 mm), a rubber septum and a reflux condenser fitted at the top with a two-tap Schlenk adaptor connected to a bubbler and an argon manifold (Note 2, 4). The flow of argon is reduced to a modest level as judged by the exit bubbler (1-2 bubbles per second), the rubber septum is removed and solid Pd2(dba)3 (550 mg, 0.600 mmol, 1.50 mol%) (Note 16) and X-Phos (573 mg, 1.20 mmol, 3.00 mol%) (Note 17) are added. The joint is sealed again with the rubber septum and dry THF (200 mL) (Note 18) and ethyl 4-bromobenzoate (9.16 g, 40.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 19) are added by syringe. The joint is opened again to add DABAL-Me3 (1) (8.31 g, 32.4 mmol, 0.801 equiv) using a powder funnel. The open socket is sealed with a glass stopper and the dark purple reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 h in an oil bath (90 \u00b0C). Completion of the reaction can by confirmed by working up an aliquot (1 mL) of the reaction mixture, as described below, and recording its 1H NMR spectrum (Note 20). The argon flow is slightly increased (3-4 bubbles per second), heating is stopped and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature over an hour. The flask is further cooled in an ice bath for 15 min and the reaction is quenched by cautious, portionwise, addition of 2 m aqueous HCl (160 mL) (Note 21). The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred into a separatory funnel (1 L) with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 22). The layers are separated, retained separately and the aqueous fraction is re-extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over MgSO4 (30 g) and filtered though a plug of activated charcoal (5 g) (Note 23) layered on the top of SiO2 (50 g) (Note 24). The plug is further washed with diethyl ether (1 L). Removal of the solvent by rotatory evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg) affords the crude product as a clear brown oil in quantitative yield. Short-path distillation under reduced pressure (118-120 \u00b0C at 0.1 mmHg) gives the product 2 (6.11 g, 37.2 mmol, 93%) as a colorless oil (Note 25)."

After completion of the addition, the mixture is allowed to stir for 2 h in the dark at 0 \u00b0C. After complete consumption of the starting material (as monitored by TLC, Note 4), the reaction is quenched with the addition of saturated aq. Na2SO3 solution until the red color disappears. This mixture is diluted with EtOAc (300 mL) and washed with H2O (200 mL \u00d7 2). The aqueous layer is re-extracted with EtOAc (150 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed successively with saturated aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (200 mL) and brine (200 mL).

The combined organic layers are concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C water bath, 150 mmHg, decreased to 20 mmHg) to provide 34 g of crude product (Note 18). The resultant pale yellow oil is dissolved in dichloromethane (300 mL) and washed sequentially with 0.5 M aqueous citric acid solution (2 \u00d7 200 mL) (Note 19), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (200 mL), and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (200 mL). The organic layer is filtered through a bed of sodium sulfate (50 g, rinsed with 2 \u00d7 75 mL of dichloromethane) and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C water bath, 150 mmHg, decreased to 20 mmHg) to give the crude reaction product 2 (22.2 g) as a viscous, pale yellow oil. The crude product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (Note 20) to afford t-butyl (3S,\u03b1R)-3-[N-benzyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amino]-4-methylpentanoate 2 (20.6 g, containing 2 wt% hexane by 1H NMR analysis, 89% corrected yield) as a viscous, colorless oil (Note 21).",

The solution is transferred to a 500-mL borosilicate Parr bottle and 20% wet palladium hydroxide on carbon (5.0 g) is added. The bottle is connected to a Parr shaker hydrogenation apparatus and flushed by 3 vacuum purge/hydrogen fill cycles. The hydrogenation reaction is then carried out under 40 psi hydrogen pressure with shaking at 21-24 \u00b0C for 6 h (Note 23). The vessel is vented and 3 nitrogen fill/vacuum purge cycles are carried out to remove hydrogen from the solution. The solution is vacuum filtered through a bed of Solka-Floc (50 g) in a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel and washed with methanol (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The catalyst cake is kept wet with methanol throughout the filtration to minimize the potential for the palladium to ignite (Note 24). The hazy filtrate is transferred to a 1-L round bottomed flask and is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C water bath, 20 mmHg) to give the crude reaction product 3 (9.6 g) as a pale yellow oil.

The flask is fitted with a septum, through which a thermocouple temperature probe and an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler are inserted. The solution is cooled to 5 \u00b0C (internal temperature) using an ice bath. Trifluoroacetic acid (15 mL) is added dropwise via syringe over a period of 10 min, resulting in a temperature rise to 9 \u00b0C. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at 21-23 \u00b0C for 13 h. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C water bath, 20 mmHg) to give a pale orange residue. Toluene (50 mL) is added to the residue and the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 \u00b0C water bath, 20 mmHg). A further 50 mL of toluene is added and the evaporation process is repeated to afford crude product as a gum (12 g) (Note 28). Diethyl ether (30 mL) and a 2-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar are added to the flask.

Into a flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (4 cm, cylindrical-shaped), reflux condenser, a pressure equalizing dropping funnel, internal thermometer and high-vacuum-argon connection is added the azido alcohol (21.6 g, 153 mmol, 1.0 equiv) followed by freshly distilled methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (40 mL) (Note 5). Triphenylphosphine (40.2 g, 153 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is dissolved in MTBE (100 mL) and the solution is transferred into the dropping funnel. The solution is added slowly and continuously over 45 min (Note 6). The addition is accompanied by the vigorous evolution of nitrogen gas and a temperature increase to 40 \u00b0C. After the addition of the triphenylphosphine solution, the dropping funnel is washed with TBME (20 mL). After nitrogen evolution has ceased, the solution is heated to reflux (70 \u00baC) for 16 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution is then transferred in a well ventilated hood to a single-necked, 1-L evaporating flask (Note 7). MTBE is removed at 40 \u00baC under reduced pressure (360 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator (Note 8) leaving an off-white solid (Ph3PO), within which is trapped the cyclohexene imine product. The cyclohexene imine is distilled in vacuo (0.01 mmHg) at 160 \u00baC from the resulting residue using a short path distillation apparatus to afford a clear, colorless liquid (Note 9). Residual MTBE, which will inevitably co-distill with the product, can be removed by freeze-drying the resulting liquid. In this procedure, the flask containing the cyclohexene imine is immersed in a -12 \u00baC sodium chloride/ice cold bath and the flask is rotated such that as cyclohexene imine begins to solidify, it forms a thin coat along the interior of the flask effectively maximizing the surface area and facilitating removal of MTBE. While still immersed in the cold-bath, a spatula is used to scratch the sides of the flask to break up the thin layer of cyclohexene imine to afford fine flakes. The residual MTBE is then removed in vacuo (0.13 mbar) while the flask remains immersed in the cold-bath to afford pure cyclohexene imine (13.6 g, 140 mmol) in 91% yield as fine white crystals below 5 \u00baC and a clear colorless liquid above this temperature (Notes 10 and 11; for GC data, see Note 12)."

Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (72 mL) (Note 2) is added to the flask via syringe and stirring commenced. Once the base is completely dissolved, giving a yellow solution, anhydrous diethyl ether (72 mL) (Note 3) is added to the flask in two portions using a 50-mL syringe. The solution is cooled to -78 \u00baC (bath temperature) in a dry ice/acetone bath (Note 4).\nConcurrently, solutions of diiodomethane and benzyl bromide in tetrahydrofuran are prepared. Diiodomethane: A flame-dried, 50-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum pierced by an argon inlet needle is charged with diiodomethane (3.62 mL, 45.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv) via syringe through the septum (Note 5).

The Schlenk flask is equipped with a 14/20 thermometer adaptor, a thermometer is inserted through the adaptor into the flask so that the bulb is completely submerged in the solution, the adaptor is then tightened so that the o-ring holds the thermometer in place, and finally the joint is wrapped tightly with Teflon tape. The flask is evacuated and back filled with dry nitrogen gas three times through the side arm. After placing it inside the glove box (Note 1), the thermometer adaptor is removed from the joint, and the flask is charged with lithium t-butoxide (4.80 g, 60.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv), 1,10-phenanthroline (1.08 g, 6.00 mmol, 0.20 equiv), CuI (1.14 g, 6.00 mmol, 0.20 equiv), and DMPU (18 mL; tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone) (Note 2). The flask is re-equipped with the thermometer and adapter, which is again wrapped tightly with Teflon tape. The Schlenk flask is taken out of the glove box. A hose attached to a Schlenk line is purged with dry nitrogen gas and connected to the side arm of the Schlenk flask. The stopcock valve is opened and the Schlenk flask is evacuated and back filled with dry nitrogen gas three times through the side arm stopcock. The flask is placed in a preheated oil bath at 125 \u00b0C and magnetically stirred for 12 h (Note 3). The brown color of the reaction mixture changes to deep red after 5-10 min and then to dark brown 30 min later.\nAfter the reaction is complete as judged by GC analysis (Note 4), the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. At that point, nitrogen atmosphere is not required any further. After dilution with EtOAc (30 mL) and stirring for 1 min, the reaction mixture is transferred to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The Schlenk flask is washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 50 mL), the EtOAc solutions are combined, and brine (100 mL) is added. The resulting mixture contains a light brown precipitate that is removed via vacuum filtration by using a 7 cm diameter filter funnel with a medium porosity fritted disk. The brown precipitate is washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 10 mL), and the resulting filtrate is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel. The top organic layer is separated from the bottom aqueous layer. The aqueous layer is extracted with additional ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 5). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (Note 6; about 9 g) followed by vacuum filtration into a 1000 mL round bottom flask by using a 7 cm diameter filter funnel with a medium porosity fritted disk. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 30 mm Hg) to give 8-10 mL of crude product. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 (Note 7), using hexanes as the eluent (4.8 L) and collecting 100 mL fractions. The first 12 fractions are blank (1.2 L), followed by 6 fractions containing starting material and minor amounts of impurities (0.6 L), and then pure product for 30 fractions (3 L collected). After concentration of the fractions containing the pure product by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg), 5.73 g (92%) of 2-chloro-5-(3-methylphenyl)-thiophene is obtained as an air stable, light yellow oil that crystallizes when cooled to -20 \u00b0C (Notes 8 and 9; mp 38-39 \u00b0C)."

Glacial acetic acid (17.5 M, 0.9 mL, 0.944 g, 0.015 mol, 0.11 equiv) (Note 1) is added via syringe to the reaction mixture. A reflux condenser is fitted to the round-bottomed flask and the resulting homogeneous pale yellow reaction mixture is heated gently to reflux, with stirring, for 48 h ensuring that the temperature of the oil bath is kept at 77 \u00b0C. Over this time, the reaction remains homogeneous, and turns orange in color (Note 2). The oil bath is removed, and the reaction flask is allowed to cool to room temperature, and then placed in a -20 \u00b0C freezer for 18 h to crystallize the product. The resulting mixture is then vacuum filtered while cold through a sintered-glass funnel (Note 3) to collect the yellow needles (Note 4), which are rinsed with pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) anhydrous diethyl ether (4 \u00d7 50 mL) (Notes 1, 5 and 6). The crude product (6.4-6.6 g; 70-72%; mp = 161-165 \u00b0C) is recrystallized by dissolving the yellow needles in hot ethanol (200 mL, 78 \u00b0C), allowing the solution to cool to room temperature, then storing it in a -20 \u00b0C freezer for 18 h. The resulting mixture is then vacuum filtered while cold, through a sintered-glass funnel (Note 3), and the pale yellow needles are rinsed with pre-cooled (0 \u00b0C) anhydrous ether (4 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 7).

            "8-Phenyl-1-tetralone (Note 1). All glassware and a magnetic stirring bar are oven-dried for about 0.5 h prior to use. A 100-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a reflux condenser connected to a vacuum/N2 line, a thermometer, a rubber septum, and a Teflon coated octagonal magnetic stirring bar of dimension 8mm \u00d7 13mm. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. While the rubber septum is temporarily removed and a positive flow of nitrogen is maintained, the flask is charged with 5,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl[1,3,2]dioxaborinane, PhB(OCH2CMe2CH2O), (8.55 g, 45.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 2) and carbonyldihydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3) (1.38 g, 1.50 mmol, 0.050 equiv) (Note 3). The flask is again evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. 3,3-Dimethylbutan-2-one (pinacolone) (15) (Note 4) and 1-tetralone (4.39 g, 4.00 mL, 30.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 5) are added to the flask through the rubber septum via syringes in the order indicated at room temperature to give a white suspension (Note 6). The resulting mixture is heated at reflux in an oil bath (oil bath temperature 125 \u00b0C) (Note 7). The reaction mixture becomes a dark red solution within 5 min. After heating for 12 h, the mixture is cooled to room temperature (Notes 8 and 9). The resulting dark red solution is transferred to a 250-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 mmHg). The three-necked flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (50 mL) in two portions, and the combined rinse is transferred to the 250-mL flask, followed by concentration by rotary evaporation. The volatile materials are further removed under vacuum (1 mmHg) for 30 min. The residue is dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask. The round-bottomed flask is further rinsed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 125 mL) and the rinse is also transferred to the Erlenmeyer flask (Note 10). Basic alumina (250 g) (Note 11) is added to the solution, and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min (Note 12). The mixture is filtered through Celite (20 g) (Note 13), and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (500 mL). After concentrating by rotary evaporation (15 mmHg), the resulting material is transferred to a 200-mL recovery flask using dichloromethane (50 mL). SiO2 (9.0 g) (Note 14) is added to the dark red solution. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (15 mmHg) and then under vacuum (1 mmHg) for 2 h. Flash column chromatography is performed by charging the resulting solid onto the top of the column of SiO2 (120 g) (Note 14) and eluting with 5% ethyl acetate in hexane (Note 15). The combined fractions containing the phenylated product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 mmHg). The resulting material is dissolved in a single-neck, open to air 1-L round-bottomed flask using methanol (90 mL) (Note 16) by heating in an oil bath with the bath temperature maintained at 90 \u00b0C. Distilled water (300 mL) is slowly added to the mixture to form a white precipitate, and then the oil bath is removed. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, water (600 mL) is slowly added. The precipitated white solid is collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 17) and washed with water (200 mL). Drying the solid under vacuum (1 mmHg) for 20 h gives 5.39-5.72 g (81-86% yield) of 8-phenyl-1-tetralone as a white solid (Note 18)."

The product is dissolved in hot Et2O (300 mL) (50 \u00b0C, at reflux) and cooled to 4 \u00b0C overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with ice-cold Et2O (50 mL). The crystals are then transferred to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask and dried overnight at 2.0 mmHg to afford a spindle-like solid (5.06-5.08 g, 73%) (Notes 13, 14, and 15)."

The organic solution is washed with water (2 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 6), then saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (50 mL) (caution: Due to the generation of CO2, the separatory funnel should be shaken carefully and the pressure released frequently). A final wash is carried out with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (50 mL), then the organic layer is vacuum-filtered through a bed of Na2SO4 (20 g) in a 150-mL medium-porosity sintered-glass funnel. The cake is washed with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 25 mL) until colorless. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 100 mmHg initial vacuum, lowered to 20 mmHg) to afford the crude product as a red oil (6.9 g). Purification using column chromatography (Note 7) on SiO2 affords 4.42-4.87 g of bis(4-fluorophenyl)difluoromethane (2) as a colorless oil (78-86% yield) (Notes 8 and 9)."

The resulting solution is flushed with nitrogen for 50 min at room temperature. Triethylphosphine (Note 9) in a glass ampule is opened in a glove box, and the liquid triethylphosphine is securely transferred into a Schlenk flask (oven dried and cooled under nitrogen), sealed, and brought inside the fume hood. Triethylphosphine (17.6 g, 22.0 mL, 149.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is thereafter transferred into a properly marked volumetric container (oven dried and cooled under nitrogen) via cannula from the Schlenk flask under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1). Triethylphosphine is then added directly to the reaction mixture from the volumetric container via cannula over 1 min (Figure 2). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 min. Acetic anhydride (15.2 g, 14.1 mL, 149.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is charged to the reaction using a syringe over 15 min (Note 10), which causes an exothermic reaction and the temperature rises to 39 \u00b0C (measured by an inserted thermometer immersed into the reaction mixture) (Figure 3). A yellow slurry solution (Note 11) is formed thereafter. The rubber septum and thermometer are quickly replaced with glass stoppers and the nitrogen inlet is moved to the top of the condenser. The resulting slurry is heated to reflux in an oil bath for 16 h, and reaction progress is monitored by HPLC or TLC (Notes 12 and 13).

Deionized water (50 mL) is poured into the flask and tetrafluoroboric acid (6.3 mL, 50 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added by syringe (Note 1). The solution is stirred, open to air, at room temperature (23 \u00b0C) for 2 min and silver carbonate (6.89 g, 25.0 mmol, 0.50 equiv) is added in several portions with a spatula over 2 min (Note 2). Carbon dioxide gas evolves. The resulting mixture is stirred rapidly (380 rpm) until all solids are dissolved to give a grey solution (20 min). Silica gel (10.0 g) is poured into the solution and the mixture is stirred for 5 min (Note 3). The stir bar is removed using a magnetic wand, rinsed with deionized water (1 mL) with a glass pipette, and the flask is transferred to a rotary evaporator into a water bath pre-heated to 55 \u00b0C. The water in the reaction flask is evaporated (55 \u00b0C, 80 mmHg, cooling is effected by circulating chilled water through the condenser) over 35 min to give the AgBF4 on SiO2 as an off-white/grey solid on the walls of the flask. A spatula is used to scrape all solids to the bottom of the flask, which is then returned to the rotary evaporator and dried with rapid spinning (55 \u00b0C, 80 mmHg). After 15 min of drying in this manner, a spatula is used to scrape all solids to the bottom of the flask. A free flowing powder is obtained. The flask is allowed to stand and cool at room temperature for 5 min before the mixture is used directly in the next step.",
            "B. Bis(pyridine)iodonium(I) tetrafluoroborate (IPy2BF4, 1). A Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3.9 cm \u00d7 1 cm, rectangular) is added to the 500-mL 1-necked flask that contains the AgBF4 on SiO2 from above. Dichloromethane (300 mL) is poured into the flask and the mixture is stirred at room temperature, open to the atmosphere (Note 4). Pyridine (8.1 mL, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is poured into the reaction flask from a 10.0 mL measuring cylinder, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature (Note 5). One minute after the addition of pyridine, iodine flakes (12.69 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) are poured into the reaction flask from a weighing paper (Note 6). A yellow precipitate (AgI) is formed immediately upon addition of the iodine. A glass stopper is used to loosely cap the reaction flask and the mixture is stirred vigorously (380 rpm) for 1 h (Note 7). The solution gradually turns red as the iodine is dissolved. After 1 h of stirring, the solids are removed by filtration through a sintered glass funnel (Note 8) under suction (15 mmHg), and the dark red filtrate is collected directly in a 1-L, 1-necked round-bottomed flask using a 24/40 glass filtration adapter. The reaction flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (100 mL) to ensure complete transfer, and the SiO2/AgI filter cake is then washed with additional dichloromethane (100 mL). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 80 mmHg) to give a reddish-yellow solid. This solid is then dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) and a Teflon-coated stir bar (5 cm \u00d7 1 cm, rectangular) is added. The solution is stirred in an ice bath for 5 min and then diethyl ether (200 mL) is poured into the stirred solution to precipitate the product (Note 9). The mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min to ensure that all IPy2BF4 is precipitated. The product is isolated by filtration under suction (15 mmHg) (Note 10). The stirrer is removed by a magnetic wand, held over the filter funnel and washed with diethyl ether (4) using a glass pipette. The flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (50 mL) to complete the transfer. The off-white powder is dried on the filter with suction for 5 min, transferred to a weighing paper (6\" \u00d7 6\") and dried under vacuum in a desiccator for 4 h (1.2 mmHg) to obtain 1 (13.67 g, 73%) (Notes 11, 12, 13 and 14). This material is used for NMR, IR and Mp analysis. IPy2BF4 can also be recrystallized from dichloromethane. Accordingly, the powdered 1 (13.64 g) is added to a 100-mL, 1-necked round-bottomed flask with a Teflon-coated stir bar (1.5 cm \u00d7 1 cm, rectangular). A water bath is preheated to 50 \u00b0C and dichloromethane (25 mL) is added to the solid. The suspension is stirred (870 rpm) and lowered into the water bath. Once the dichloromethane is boiling (ca. 1 min), additional dichloromethane is added by glass pipette, with stirring, until all solids are dissolved (48 mL of additional dichloromethane, ca. 73 mL of total solvent). Once a clear solution is obtained, the stirring is stopped and the flask removed from the water bath. Crystals are observed within 3 min. After 30 min, the flask is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (ice bath) to facilitate the crystallization. After 2 h on ice, the crystals are isolated by filtration with suction (15 mmHg) (Note 15), collecting the filtrate directly in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask. The suction is removed, the stir bar is held over the filter funnel with a magnetic wand and washed with diethyl ether (2 mL), and the crystals are triturated with diethyl ether (30 mL) on the filter. The crystals are then dried on the filter for 5 min with suction, transferred to a jar and dried under vacuum in a desiccator for 2 h (1.2 mmHg). The first crop of crystals yields 8.34 g (Notes 16 and 17). All remaining material in the crystallization flask and filter is collected by rinsing with dichloromethane (50 mL). The combined filtrates and mother liquor are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 80 mm Hg) to give a reddish yellow solid. The recrystallization is repeated twice more to recover the remaining material, using dichloromethane (24 mL) in a 50-mL round-bottomed flask in the second recrystallization (2.46 g of crystals isolated) and dichloromethane (23 mL) in a 25-mL round-bottomed flask in the third and final recrystallization (0.79 g of crystals isolated). The total recovery of 1 from recrystallization is 11.59 g (85% from powdered IPy2BF4 and 62% overall)."

The open neck is capped with a rubber septum, and DMI (72 mL) (Note 2) and THF (17.5 mL) (Note 10) are each added via syringe. The resulting orange solution is stirred at rt for 10 min, and then the organozinc reagent (0.72 M in DMI; 63.2 mL, 45.5 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added via syringe over 6 min, maintaining the internal temperature below 30 \u00b0C. The resulting dark-brown reaction mixture is stirred at rt (temperature of the solution: 23 \u00b0C) for 24 h. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by 1H NMR analysis of an aliquot of the reaction mixture. After the \u03b1-bromo amide starting material is completely consumed (determined by observing the disappearance of a triplet at \u03b4 3.95), the excess organozinc reagent is quenched by adding ethanol (15 mL). The brown reaction mixture is diluted with Et2O (500 mL), and the resulting solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with H2O (300 mL \u00d7 3). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (30 g) and filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel containing a bed of celite (1.0 cm height). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg), and the resulting orange oil is purified by column chromatography on SiO2 (wet packed in hexanes; 8 cm diameter \u00d7 30 cm height; 350 g; eluting with a gradient of EtOAc in hexanes (500 mL of 10% EtOAc/hexanes, 1.5 L of 15% EtOAc/hexanes, 1.5 L of 20% EtOAc/hexanes, 1.0 L of 30% EtOAc/hexanes, 1.0 L of 40% EtOAc/ hexanes; 100-mL fractions) (Note 11). The cross-coupling product 2 has an Rf= 0.5 (TLC analysis on SiO2 (30% EtOAc/hexanes, visualization with a UV lamp) (Note 12). The desired product is obtained as a white solid (10.4-10.8 g, 85-89% yield, 91% ee) (Note 13)."

To a 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm \u00d7 2 cm egg-shaped) is added 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (1) (4.08 g, 27.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 2-aminobenzyl alcohol (2) (3.49 g, 28.3 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 1). The solids are dissolved in methanol (70 mL), and glacial acetic acid (7.73 mL, 0.135 mol) is added to give a clear, yellow-orange solution (Note 2). 2-Picoline borane (3.50 g, 28.3 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 3) is added in one portion, resulting in gas evolution and a mild exotherm (5 \u00b0C). The reaction flask is sealed with a septum, vented with a needle, and stirred for 3 h at room temperature at which point the reaction is darker orange in color. Reductive amination to (2-(2-nitrobenzylamino)phenyl)methanol is complete as indicated by the disappearance of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde by TLC analysis (Note 4). Additional methanol (200 mL) (Note 2) is added followed by a solution of potassium hydroxide (22.7 g, 0.405 mol) in water (30 mL) (Note 5). The septum is removed, the flask is fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser, and the solution is heated, with stirring, to reflux (85 \u00b0C oil bath temperature, internal reaction temperature 72 \u00b0C) for 1.5 h to affect the bis-heterocyclization reaction (Note 6). The flask is removed from the oil bath, the solution is cooled to room temperature, and concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (45-50 \u00b0C, 200-230 mmHg) to remove methanol, at which point a tan precipitate forms. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and 1 M HCl (300 mL) is added (Note 7). The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and ethyl acetate (200 mL) is added, which dissolves the precipitate. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with 1 M HCl (1 \u00d7 200 mL), 1 M K2CO3 (2 \u00d7 200 mL), and brine (1 \u00d7 200 mL). The organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (40 g), filtered, and the solid residue is rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined extracts are concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (45-50 \u00b0C, 200-230 mmHg). Purification by flash column chromatography on SiO2 (Note 8) affords 5.29-5.38 g of 5H-indazolo[3,2-b]benzo[d]-1,3-oxazine (3) as a white solid in 88.2-89.7% yield (Note 9).",

To a 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm \u00d7 2 cm egg-shaped) is added 2-nitrobenzyl bromide (4) (6.00 g, 27.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 2-aminobenzyl alcohol (2) (4.11 g, 33.4 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 10). The solids are dissolved in methanol (120 mL), and diisopropylethyl amine (DIEA, 9.5 mL, 55.6 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added (Note 11). The reaction flask is fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser, and the solution is heated to reflux (85 \u00b0C oil bath temperature, internal reaction temperature 73 \u00b0C) for 4 h. At this point, the displacement reaction is complete as indicated by the disappearance of 2-nitrobenzyl bromide by TLC analysis (Note 12). The solution is cooled to room temperature, then potassium hydroxide pellets (23.4 g, 0.417 mol) (Note 13) are added followed by water (12 mL). Upon addition, the solution turns orange in color and an exotherm (20 \u00b0C) is seen. The reaction vessel is again fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser and heated to reflux to affect the bis-heterocyclization reaction (85 \u00b0C oil bath temperature, internal reaction temperature 72 \u00b0C). After stirring at this temperature for 1.5 h (Note 14), the flask is removed from the oil bath, the solution is cooled to room temperature, and concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (45-50 \u00b0C, 200-230 mmHg) to remove methanol, during which time a heterogeneous emulsion is produced. The mixture is cooled in an ice/water bath, 1 M HCl (450 mL) is added (Note 15), and a white precipitate is observed. The mixture (room temperature) is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. Ethyl acetate is added (200 mL) to dissolve the precipitate. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 100 mL).

A 2.0 L, single-necked, round-bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stir bar (1 1/4 inch \u00d7 5/8 inch egg shaped), and a rubber septum with a needle inlet is flame dried and then cooled under an argon atmosphere. The septum is removed and the flask is charged with sodium hydride (3.48 g, 60% in mineral oil, 87.15 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 1) via a powder funnel, followed by n-pentane (300 mL) (Note 2). The septum is then replaced and the heterogeneous mixture is subjected to an argon atmosphere by means of a needle in the septum followed by agitation for 20 min. Agitation is stopped and the sodium hydride is allowed to settle out of solution for 30 min. n-Pentane is removed via cannula by increasing the positive pressure of argon in the flask. Residual mineral oil present in sodium hydride is removed by washing with an additional 100 mL of pentane as above. The combined pentane solutions containing residual sodium hydride are quenched with isopropanol (Note 3). The septum is briefly removed to add anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (1.0 L) (Note 4) by means of an addition funnel followed by replacement of the septum and refilling the reaction flask with argon. The reaction flask is placed in a -10 \u00b0C ice-brine bath (Note 5) with agitation and allowed to cool for 30 min. The septum is then replaced with a powder funnel and (1R,2S)-(-)-cis-1-amino-2-indanol (5 g, 33.52 mmol) (Note 6) is added followed by refilling of the reaction flask with argon. Within 10 min, the reaction mixture turns heterogeneous and the color changes to light purple. The septum is then replaced with a powder funnel and a further batch of (1R,2S)-(-)-cis-1-amino-2-indanol (5 g, 33.52 mmol) (Note 6) is added followed by refilling of the reaction flask with argon. The flask is then fitted with a reflux condenser and the stirred reaction mixture is heated in a 70 \u00b0C oil bath for 40 min under an argon atmosphere. The solution is then placed into a -10 \u00b0C ice-brine bath and allowed to cool for 1 h while stirring. Ethyl chloroacetate (8.38 g, 7.32 mL, 68.37 mmol, 1.02 equiv) (Note 7) is added via syringe over 5 min. The reaction flask is removed from the ice-brine bath and the mixture is stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solution is then placed in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 h under argon. After cooling to room temperature, brine (30 mL) is slowly added to the reaction flask to quench the reaction, and then THF is removed under reduced pressure using a rotarory evaporator. The homogeneous deep purple reaction mixture is then poured into a 2.0-L separatory funnel and brine (200 mL) is added. The reaction mixture is extracted using ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL) (Note 8). The combined organic layers are then dried using anhydrous MgSO4 (50 g) (Note 9) followed by vacuum filtration through a coarse fritted funnel. The resultant purple solution is transferred into a 1.0-L round-bottomed flask in approx. 500 mL portions and concentrated in vacuo to dryness. To the 1.0-L round bottom flask containing the crude light brown solid is added a stir bar and hexanes (300 mL) (Note 10). The sides of the round-bottomed flask are scraped with a metal spatula to ensure that all of the crude solid material rests at the bottom of the flask. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser left open to the atmosphere and the heterogeneous mixture is stirred vigorously in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C for a period of 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, vacuum filtration affords an off-white solid which is transferred into a 100-mL round-bottomed flask by means of a powder funnel and dried under vacuum (2 mmHg) in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C for 1 h, affording 10.21-10.95 g (80-86%) of 1 (Note 11).",

A 3-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated overhead stirrer in the center port (Note 1) and placed in a \u221210 \u00b0C acetone bath (Note 2). The flask is charged with conc. HCl (26.5 mL) and water (55 mL) (Notes 3 and 4). Another port of the reaction vessel is equipped with a 60-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel and charged with 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (15.0 mL, 107 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5), which is added dropwise over a period of approximately 5 min resulting in a thick white slurry. Stirring is continued for an additional 15 min (Notes 6 and 7). At this time, the third port is equipped with a thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of the reaction. The addition funnel is replaced with a new 60-mL addition funnel that is charged with a freshly prepared solution of NaNO2 (7.38 g, 107 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in water (20 mL) (Note 4). This solution is added dropwise so as to maintain an internal temperature of < 5 \u00b0C (Note 8). The addition funnel is washed with H2O (5 mL) (Note 4) and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min. The addition funnel is replaced with a new addition funnel which is charged with a solution of SnCl2\u20222H2O (60.4 g, 268 mmol, 2.50 equiv) in 1:1 conc. HCl/H2O (60 mL) (Note 9). The SnCl2solution is added dropwise over 4 h maintaining an internal reaction temperature of < 5 \u00b0C. The addition funnel and thermometer are removed. The heterogeneous orange mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 1 h before being allowed to warm to ambient temperature and vigorous stirring is maintained for 16 h. The mixture is cooled by placing the reaction vessel in the refrigerator operating at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. The orange precipitate is collected by suction filtration (Note 10) and the reaction vessel is washed with brine (5 \u00d7 50 mL) that is poured over the collected solid with each wash. The orange solid is transferred to a 1-L round-bottom flask and Et2O (300 mL) (Note 11) and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar are added. The heterogeneous mixture is placed in an ice/brine bath and the flask is equipped with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel charged with aq 10 M NaOH (200 mL) that is added over approximately 30 min. An additional 100 mL of H2O (Note 4) is added and stirring is continued for 1 h before the biphasic mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with Et2O (2 \u00d7 200 mL).

Stirring is maintained for 30 min and the solution is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The overhead stirrer is removed and washed with Et2O (20 mL). The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure and MeOH (400 mL) is added. The heterogeneous mixture is heated to 50 \u00b0C until the solid is dissolved [approximately for 10 min] and the solvent is then removed to dryness using a rotary evaporator under vacuum to afford a crystalline product (Note 12). Et2O (500 mL) is added and the center neck is equipped with a water condenser, while the other neck has a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 30 min and then the heterogeneous mixture is cooled to room temperature.

A solution of 200 proof EtOH/Et2O (5:1, 60 mL) is added, and the suspension is placed into a sonicating bath for 30 min (Note 13). The pale orange solid is collected by suction filtration (Note 11) and washed with a solution of 200 proof EtOH/Et2O (1:1, 3 \u00d7 30 mL). The filtrate is concentrated using a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg) to produce an orange crystalline solid.

Acetonitrile (5.5 mL) (Note 5) is added in one portion using a syringe under constant stirring. A white opaque mixture is obtained at the end of this step. Benzaldehyde (2.50 mL, 24.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6) is added over 15 seconds using a syringe under constant stirring, and upon addition the reaction mixture becomes an opaque yellow. A tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution (4.00 mL, 28.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 7) is added using a syringe under constant stirring and the mixture turns green. The reaction flask is then placed in an oil bath at 40 \u00b0C for 6 h under constant stirring.\nAfter placing the reaction flask in the oil bath, the reaction mixture gradually becomes a clear orange-gold solution. The reaction flask is taken out of the oil bath and is placed in an ice-bath. Upon cooling, the reaction mixture becomes a thick, opaque mustard-yellow. Hydrochloric acid (1.6 M, 7.5 mL) is added dropwise (ca. 4 drops per second) under constant stirring. Upon neutralization, the reaction mixture turns green. The reaction flask is taken out of the ice-bath and ethyl acetate (25 mL) (Note 8) and distilled water (20 mL) are added. The organic layer is light green and the aqueous layer white-blue and opaque. If left overnight at room temperature, the organic layer may turn orange. The mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The 100-mL round-bottomed flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (15 mL) and distilled water (15 mL). The rinsings are transferred to the separatory funnel. Brine (15 mL) is added to the separatory funnel to obtain a better phase separation. The two layers are separated and transferred into 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The aqueous layer is then transferred back to the separatory funnel and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 25 mL). Brine (3 \u00d7 15 mL) is added to facilitate every extraction. The organic layers are combined and washed with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (25 mL) and poured into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (4.0 g) (Note 9) is added. The solution is filtered under vacuum using a 30-mL suction funnel equipped with a medium porosity fritted-disc into an oven-dried, 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The magnesium sulfate in the frit is washed with two portions of ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 10 mL), and the combined filtrate is concentrated under vacuum (40 \u00b0C and 21 mmHg) to provide a white-beige solid. Dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 10) is added to the round-bottomed flask. The flask is sonicated for 30 seconds resulting in a green brown solution. Silica gel (5.0 g) (Note 11) is added to the flask and the solvent is evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 55-60 \u00b0C (21 mmHg).

The column is packed with silica gel, flushed with 1000 mL of the eluent (hexanes: ethyl acetate = 3:2) (Note 12). The eluent level is adjusted to the upper level of the silica gel. The silica gel containing the compound is then loaded on the column and column chromatography is then performed (1.7 L of eluent is used). The collected fractions (15 mL each) are analysed using TLC (eluting with hexanes: ethyl acetate =3:2) and the spots are visualized using a UV lamp (254 nm) (Note 13). The fractions (41 to 92) containing the desired compound are combined and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator.

The drying agent is removed by filtration before the organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (the bath temperature is increased from 30 to 45 \u00b0C, 30-60 mmHg) yielding the crude product as a white solid. This solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (120 mL) (Notes 10, 1110, 11) at 25 \u00b0C, before hexanes (20.0 mL) (Note 12) is added over two min. Upon clouding, the solution is cooled in an ice/water bath to 0-5 \u00b0C, and hexanes (100.0 mL) is added over 10 minutes. Crystals are allowed to age for 1 h at 0-5 \u00b0C, before isolation on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The white cotton-like solid is washed with ambient temperature hexanes (30.0 mL). The mother liquor and wash are concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature increased from 28 to 46 \u00b0C, 30-60 mmHg), yielding an off-white solid that is purified via crystallization using dichloromethane (30 mL) and hexanes (30 mL) (Note 13). The first crop provided 7.50 g, and the second crop 0.91 g of product. The total yield of (E)-1-(2-aminophenyl)ethanone oxime is 8.41 g (56.0 mmol, 76.9%, 98.0% pure by GC) (Notes 14, 15).",

Triethylamine (18.1 mL, 130 mmol, 2.00 equiv) (Note 17) is added via syringe, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min at ambient temperature before being cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath. Methanesulfonyl chloride (6.00 mL, 78.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) (Note 18) is added to 300 mL dichloromethane (Note 16), and the resulting solution is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath. The cold solution of methanesulfonyl chloride is added via cannula to the colorless oxime mixture over 30 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred at 0-5 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. Silica gel (Notes 19, 20) is added, and the green/brown solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature is 25 \u00b0C, 30-60 mmHg). The resulting brown solid is loaded on a flash chromatography column (2.50 in. diameter glass column and ca 410 g of silica) (Note 21). The product is eluted using 3.00 L of 2:3 ethyl acetate-hexanes, followed by 2.00 L of 1:1 ethyl acetate-hexanes.

A tared 1-L round-bottomed flask (Note 1) equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with a 31 wt% solution of methylamine in ethanol (112 mL, 85 g, 0.85 mol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 2) and placed in a room temperature water bath. To the stirred solution is added L-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride (40.0 g, 0.287 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) via a powder funnel followed by a rinse with ethanol (10 mL). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe (Note 4). The mixture is stirred at 20-22 \u00b0C for 4 h (Notes 5 and 6). The stir bar is removed, and the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mm Hg, 45 \u00b0C bath temperature) to provide a wet solid (60 g). Toluene (100 mL) (Note 7) is added to the mixture, which is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mm Hg, 45 \u00b0C bath temperature) to provide a wet solid (65 g). The toluene (100 mL) flush is repeated, and the mixture is concentrated to 49 g of solids, which are dried in a vacuum oven (20 mmHg, 45 \u00b0C) for 4 h to afford the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 as a pasty solid (45 g) (Notes 8 and 9).\nThe 1-L flask containing the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 is equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar. The solids are scraped off the walls using a spatula (Note 10). The flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and charged with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g) and dichloromethane (140 mL) (Note 11). The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and treated sequentially with triethylamine (60.0 mL, 43.6 g, 0.425 mol, 1.5 equiv) and pivaldehyde (95% purity, 35 mL, 28 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.07 equiv corrected for purity) (Notes 11 and 12). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe (Note 4). The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature (Notes 13 and 14). Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 \u00b0C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 \u00b0C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.

            "B. (2R,5S)-2-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylimidazolidin-4-one (3). A 500-mL round-bottomed, three-necked flask, equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar, is fitted with two septa and a 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler. A thermocouple probe is inserted through one septum (Note 4). The flask is charged with ethanol (140 mL), placed in an ice-water bath, and cooled to 1-3 \u00b0C. The addition funnel is charged with acetyl chloride (22.3 mL, 24.5 g, 0.312 mol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 17). The acetyl chloride is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred ethanol solution, resulting in a temperature rise to 18 \u00b0C. The solution is cooled to 5 \u00b0C with an ice bath. The addition funnel is replaced with a standard tapered glass funnel, and maintaining ice bath cooling, the crude imine (2) (45.7 g, 95% pure, 0.255 mol) is poured into the HCl/ethanol solution as one portion over 30 s. The flask that contained 2 is rinsed with ethanol (3 \u00d7 10 mL), and the rinses are added to the HCl/ethanol solution via the tapered glass funnel. The glass funnel is removed and replaced with an inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. The reaction temperature rises from 5 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C over a 3 min period after addition of the imine, and crystallization occurs within 10 min (Note 18). The ice-bath is removed and replaced with a heating mantle, and the stirred mixture is warmed to 70 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C over 30 min and held at this temperature for 20 min (Note 19). The mixture remains heterogeneous. The heating mantle is removed, and the stirred mixture is allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C over 1.5 h, and stirring is continued for 2 h at ambient temperature. The resulting crystals are vacuum filtered using a 350-mL sintered glass funnel. The filter cake is washed with ethanol (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and air-dried to afford (2R,5S)-2-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylimidazolidin-4-one (3) (43.2 g) as white crystalline material (Note 20). The mother liquors are concentrated to 80 mL by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 \u00b0C bath temperature) in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask, and the crystallization process is repeated to afford a second batch of 3 (3.9 g) as white crystalline material (Note 21). The first and second batches are combined to afford 47.1 g of 3 (89% yield for this step, 77-80% for 3 steps) (Notes 22 - 26)."

            "A. Bromodiethylsulfonium Bromopentachloroantimonate (\"BDSB\") ( 1).An oven-dried, one-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar (egg-shaped, 45 mm length and 20 mm diameter) is purged with argon and sealed using a rubber septum and an argon inlet (Note 1). 1,2-Dichloroethane (200 mL) (Note 2) and bromine (4.27 mL, 13.3 g, 83.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) are syringed into the flask, which is then cooled in a \u221230 \u00b0C dry ice-cooled acetone bath. To this vigorously stirring dark red solution is added diethyl sulfide (9.88 mL, 8.27 g, 91.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 4) via syringe over the course of 1 min. The solution instantly lightens to a yellow-orange color. Maintaining the temperature of the bath between -30 and -35 \u00b0C by occasionally adding more dry ice, an antimony pentachloride solution (100 mL, 1 M in CH2Cl2, 100 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 5) is cannulated slowly into the reaction flask over 10 min. The color of the solution first darkens to an orange-red, and as the addition proceeds, a yellow precipitate is observed. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at -30 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min and then the acetone bath is replaced with a cold water bath (~10 \u00b0C). The water bath is heated slowly (~2 \u00b0C per min) until all of the precipitate has dissolved (bath temperature = 26-32 \u00b0C), yielding a transparent homogeneous red solution. At this time, the rubber septum and argon inlet are quickly replaced with a tightly sealed cap and the flask is moved to a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator. After 8 h at 4 \u00b0C, the flask (now containing significant amounts of orange crystals) is moved to a -20 \u00b0C freezer, where it is kept for 14 h. The crystalline product (1) is isolated by decanting the majority of the solvent and then removing any residual solvent via pipette. The crystals are then washed with cold (-20 \u00b0C) CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 10 mL) (Note 6) and dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 2 h) to afford 39.2-39.8 g (86-87%) of pure BDSB (1) as light orange plates (Note 7).",
            "B. Geranyl Diethyl Phosphate (2).To an argon-purged 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (round, with removable pivot ring, 40 mm length and 8 mm diameter), a rubber septum, and argon inlet is added geraniol (14.0 mL, 12.3 g, 80.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 8), pyridine (16.1 mL, 15.8 g, 200 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 9) and diethyl ether (60 mL) (Note 10) via syringe. The clear solution is cooled in a \u221230 \u00b0C dry ice-cooled acetone bath and stirred vigorously while diethyl chlorophosphate (17.4 mL, 20.7 g, 120 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 11) is added dropwise via syringe over the course of 10 min. Once the addition is complete, the reaction flask is removed from the cold bath (now \u221220 \u00b0C) and allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C. Significant amounts of white precipitate appear as the reaction proceeds (Note 12). After stirring for 6.5 h at 23 \u00b0C, the reaction is quenched by the addition of ice-cold 1 M NaOH (150 mL) over ~1 min (a slight exotherm occurs). The biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min, then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted into EtOAc (3 \u00d7 150 mL) (Note 13). The combined organic layers are washed with 1 M HCl (2 \u00d7 150 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (150 mL) and brine (150 mL), and dried over MgSO4 (Note 14). The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration (medium-pore frit) and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 150 \u2192 10 mmHg) and then under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 1 h). The crude yellow oil is pipetted onto a plug of packed silica gel (5 \u00d7 10 cm) (Note 15) and transferred quantitatively by adding CH2Cl2 washes (3 \u00d7 5 mL). The product is eluted with pressurized air directly into a 2-L round-bottomed flask with ice-cold hexanes (300 mL) (Note 16) followed by hexanes:EtOAc (2:3, 1.25 L). The bulk of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 150 \u2192 10 mmHg) and the resultant geranyl diethyl phosphate (Note 17) is transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked round-bottom flask and co-evaporated with dry toluene (3 \u00d7 15 mL; 30 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) (Note 18) to remove both residual EtOAc and trace water.",
            "C. Homogeranylbenzene (3).A magnetic stirring bar (round, with removable pivot ring, 40 mm length and 8 mm diameter) is added to the flask containing crude geranyl diethyl phosphate, which is dried under vacuum (20 min, 23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg), back-filled with argon and sealed with a rubber septum and argon inlet. The viscous yellow oil is dissolved in dry THF (30 mL) (Note 19) and cooled in a -45 \u00b0C dry ice-cooled acetone bath. A solution of benzylmagnesium chloride in THF (0.5 M, 320 mL, 160 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 20) is cannulated into the stirring geranyl diethyl phosphate solution over the course of 20 min (Note 21), with the continuous addition of dry ice to the cold bath to maintain its temperature between -40 \u00b0C and -45 \u00b0C. Upon completion of the addition of the Grignard reagent, the cold bath is allowed to warm slowly for 2.5 h (to 5 \u00b0C) and then is removed (Note 22). The light brown solution is stirred for an additional 2 h at 23 \u00b0C. Saturated aqueous NH4Cl (75 mL) and water (75 mL) are added carefully to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min (slight exotherm). This mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with hexanes:EtOAc (2:1, 3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (150 mL) and brine (150 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 150 \u2192 10 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 1 h). The crude yellow oil is then pipetted onto a column of packed silica gel (360 g, 80 mm diameter) (Note 23) and transferred quantitatively by adding hexanes rinses (3 \u00d7 5 mL). The column is eluted with hexanes (300 mL), then fraction collection is initiated (30 mL each) with further elution being performed with hexanes:CH2Cl2 (19:1, 900 mL) followed by hexanes:CH2Cl2 (9:1, 900 mL). The desired product is found in pure form in fractions 17-43 (fractions 44-50 are contaminated with bibenzyl and are discarded), which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 300 \u2192 10 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 1 h) to afford 16.7 g (92% from geraniol) of homogeranylbenzene as a colorless oil (Notes 24 and 25).",
            "D. Cyclization of 3 to 4.Homogeranylbenzene (1.14 g, 5.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added to a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar (egg-shaped, 45 mm length and 20 mm diameter). The flask is purged with argon, and two of the necks are equipped with an argon inlet and a low-temperature thermometer, respectively. Dry nitromethane (485 mL) (Note 26) is poured through a funnel into the flask, and the third neck is capped. The colorless solution is cooled using a dry ice-cooled acetone bath (approx -30 \u00b0C) until the interior temperature reaches -25 \u00b0C. A solution of BDSB (3.02 g, 5.5 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in nitromethane (15 mL) that has been sealed and pre-cooled to -20 \u00b0C in a freezer is syringed in rapidly (Note 27) while stirring vigorously. The dark yellow solution is stirred for 5 min at -25 \u00b0C (Notes 28 and 29) at which time the flask is removed from the cold bath and the now light yellow solution is quenched by the addition of 2% aqueous Na2SO3 (Note 30; 300 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL). The biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously and allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C over 60 min (Note 31). The quenched reaction mixture is then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted vigorously with hexanes (4 \u00d7 300 mL) (Note 32). The combined hexanes layers are washed with brine (300 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 100 mmHg). The crude product is dried under high vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 1 h) to afford 1.45-1.62 g of a white solid that is approximately 85-90% pure product by 1H NMR (Note 33). The crude product is dissolved in 100 mL of boiling methanol (Note 34), and the light yellow solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23 \u00b0C overnight. The crystallization is allowed to proceed for an additional 12 h at 4 \u00b0C and 24 h at -20 \u00b0C. The first crop is then isolated by vacuum filtration using a medium-pore fritted funnel, washed with cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol (5 mL) and dried under vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 1 mmHg, 1 h) to afford 0.952-0.955 g of 4 as white plates. A second crop is obtained by concentrating the combined mother liquor and methanol wash to a volume of ~20 mL by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 80 mmHg) (Note 35), heating to reflux if necessary to render the solution homogenous, and cooling to 4 \u00b0C for 24 h followed by 24 h at -20 \u00b0C. Filtration and rinsing with cold methanol (2 mL) yields an additional 0.136-0.147 g of 4 as off-white needles, for a total of 1.09-1.10 g (71-72%) of pure 4 (Note 36)."

Dry DMF (70 mL) (Note 11) is added, and the mixture is stirred for 21 h at 80 \u00b0C in an oil bath (internal temperature) and then is allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel charged with ethyl acetate (80 mL) and saturated aq. NH4Cl solution (80 mL). The organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 40 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with saturated aq. NaCl solution (5 \u00d7 80 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered through a 17G3 fritted-glass funnel (Iwaki Glass, Co.) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to afford crude solid product. The crude product is dissolved in 5 mL of methanol at 40 \u00b0C and is allowed to cool to -30 \u00b0C for 1 h. The resulting crystals are collected by filtration on a 17G3 fritted-glass funnel (Iwaki Glass, Co.) and washed with 10 mL of cold methanol (1.65 g, 7.74 mmol, 77%). The mother liquor is concentrated, and the resulting solid is recrystallized from methanol (2 mL) to yield a second crop (0.29 g, 1.4 mmol, 14%). The process is repeated to yield a third crop (0.02 g, 0.01 mmol, 1.0%). The combined crystals are dried overnight at 0.1 mmHg to give 1.96 g (92%) of methyl 4-(2-pyridyl)benzoate (4) as a white crystalline solid (Note 12)."

A 500-mL, 3-necked oven-dried round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. (Note 1) The flask is charged with (+)-B-methoxydiisopinocampheylborane ((+)-(Ipc)2BOMe) (13.3 g, 42.1 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 2) and diethyl ether (45 mL), which results in a clear and colorless solution. The solution is cooled to 3 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath and vigorously stirred. Allylmagnesium bromide solution (1.0 M in diethyl ether, 40 mL, 40 mmol, 1.20 equiv) (Notes 2 and 3) is then added dropwise over 20 min via a 60 mL disposable syringe with 18-gauge needle, maintaining the temperature below 6 \u00b0C. A large amount of white solids (presumably MgBr(OMe)) precipitate during the addition. After the addition is complete, the ice/water bath is removed, then the reaction mixture is vigorously stirred (Note 4) for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting (lIpc)2B(allyl) mixture in ether is used immediately in the next step without further purification (Note 5).",

The heterogeneous mixture of (lIpc)2B(allyl) generated in Step A is cooled to -75 \u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath under vigorous stirring, then a solution of (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal (2) (10.9 g, 33.4 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 6) in diethyl ether (25 mL) is added dropwise over 20 min via syringe (Note 7), maintaining the temperature below -70 \u00b0C. The resulting mixture is vigorously stirred at -70 to -75 \u00b0C for 1.5 h (Note 8), then the dry ice/acetone bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (22 \u00b0C) over 1 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to 3 \u00b0C with an ice/water bath. A 125-mL gas equilibrating dropping funnel is attached to the flask, moving the gas adapter from one neck of the flask to the top of the dropping funnel. A premixed solution of 3M NaOH (64 mL) and 30 % H2O2 (26 mL) (Note 9) is carefully added via the dropping funnel over 10 min (exothermic), keeping the temperature below 15 \u00b0C, followed by addition of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (80 mL) over 3 min via the dropping funnel (Note 10). The resulting biphasic mixture is vigorously stirred for 10 h at room temperature (Note 11) to completely hydrolyze borinate ester products, then the organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 80 mL). After the combined organic layers are washed with brine (2 \u00d7 50 mL), the ether solution is transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 3-cm, egg-shaped Teflon-coated stir bar, then THF (150 mL), water (80 mL) and iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate salt (15.0 g) are added (Note 12). The flask is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The resulting mixture is vigorously stirred for 14 h, then the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (2 \u00d7 50 mL), dried over 100 g of anhydrous Na2SO4 and vacuum filtered through a medium porosity sintered-glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 100 mmHg initial to 20 mmHg) by rotary evaporation to give a light yellow residue (32 g), containing a 93 : 7 mixture of 3 and its anti diastereomer (5) (Note 13).

An oven-dried (>150 \u00b0C for 12 h), three-necked, 200-mL, round-bottomed flask, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, thermometer, rubber septum, and Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar are assembled while hot, and the apparatus is cooled under a stream of nitrogen venting to a manifold (20 min). The septum is removed and the flask is charged with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (55.0 mg, 0.141 mmol, 0.005 equiv) (Note 1) and N-propargyl phthalimide (5.99 g, 32.3 mmol, 1.15 equiv) (Note 2). The rubber septum is replaced and the apparatus is gently re-flushed (5 min) with a stream of nitrogen and then kept under a positive nitrogen pressure using a mineral oil bubbler attached to the outlet. 1,2-Dichloroethane (52 mL) (Note 3) is added via syringe, and magnetic stirring is started. 1-(2-Methoxyethoxy)-1-vinylcyclopropane (VCP, 4.3 mL, 4.00 g, 28.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 4) is added in a single portion via syringe (ca. 1 min later) (Note 5). At this time, the thermometer is immersed in the amber-colored heterogeneous reaction mixture and reads 25 \u00b0C. Under a positive pressure of nitrogen, the rubber septum is replaced by a Teflon stopper and the reaction vessel is lowered into a preheated oil bath (external bath temperature 90-100 \u00b0C). Within five min after the start of heating, the reaction mixture becomes golden yellow and homogeneous and reaches an internal reflux temperature of 82-84 \u00b0C. The progress of the reaction is followed by TLC analysis (Note 6) until consumption of the VCP is complete (25 min, during which time the homogeneous reaction solution darkens in color from golden yellow to orange to a deep red-brown).\nAt this time the reaction vessel is removed from the oil bath, and stirring of the mixture is continued at ambient temperature for 90 min until the solution cools to an internal temperature of 25-30 \u00b0C. A 0.1 N HCl/EtOH solution (6.0 mL) (Note 7) is added in a single portion via syringe, and the red-brown homogeneous reaction solution is stirred at ambient temperature (30 min) until hydrolysis of the initial [5+2] cycloadduct 1 to ketone 2 is complete (as determined by TLC analysis) (Note 6). The solution is then transferred to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. Two portions (75 mL each) of diethyl ether are used to rinse the reaction vessel and are combined with the transferred reaction solution (Note 8). Silica gel (30 g) (Note 9) is added, and the resulting slurry is concentrated in vacuo by rotary evaporation (Note 10) until the apricot-colored dry silica flows freely in the flask (Note 11).\nThe dry silica is loaded onto a chromatography column (pre-packed with a slurry of 260 g of silica gel in a 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes mixture), and the product is eluted using the same solvent mixture (Note 12). Collection of 25 mL fractions begins immediately, and product-containing fractions (as determined by TLC analysis) (Note 6) are combined in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator (37 \u00b0C bath, 10 mm Hg) to give a viscous, pale yellow oil. This oil is then transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask using successive rinses of dichloromethane (100 mL total volume). Evaporation of solvent (rotary evaporator followed by 12 h under high vacuum) (Notes 10 and 13) provides the purified [5+2] cycloadduct 2 as an off-white, powdery solid, mp = 71-73 \u00b0C (6.84 g, 90% yield) (Notes 14 and 15). The submitters report 95-96% yield (7.2-7.3 g) of 2 (mp = 71-72 \u00b0C) using freshly prepared 1-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1-vinylcyclopropane."

An oven-dried 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar (Note 2), and one neck is fitted with a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, to which is attached a nitrogen inlet, and the second neck is sealed with a rubber septum. The reaction flask is charged with solid 1,4-cyclohexanedione mono-ethylene ketal (25.0 g, 160 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and then N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 3) (100 mL) is added to dissolve the solid. Triethylamine (52.0 mL, 368 mmol, 2.3 equiv) is added via syringe to the reaction vessel. Freshly distilled trimethylsilyl chloride (26.7 mL, 208 mmol, 1.3 equiv) is added to the addition funnel and then dispensed dropwise into the reaction vessel over a period of ~15 min. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is replaced with a condenser, and the reaction mixture is then heated in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C (bath temperature) for 12 h (Note 4). After cooling to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C), the reaction is quenched by addition of cold H2O (150 mL, cooled in an ice bath for 15 min), and the resulting mixture is diluted with hexanes (300 mL) and then transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and back-extracted with hexanes (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined hexane extracts are washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (1 \u00d7 100 mL), saturated aqueous NH4Cl (2 \u00d7 150 mL), and then brine (1 \u00d7 150 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (25 g) for 15 min and then concentrated on a rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C). Further concentration under reduced pressure (0.5 mmHg, ambient temperature, 23 \u00b0C) delivers 32.6 g (89%) of the silyl enol ether 1 (Note 5) as a dark yellow oil, which is of sufficient purity for use in the subsequent step.",

To a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with an egg-shapped magnetic stir bar (0.625 \u00d7 1.5 in) is added crude silyl enol ether 1 (32.0 g, 140 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 500 mL of CH2Cl2. The reaction mixture is cooled to -78 \u00b0C (acetone/dry ice bath temperature) with stirring for 15 min. Stirring is stopped and ozone is bubbled through the solution with a fritted-glass gas dispersion tube for ~1-2 h until the blue color of ozone persists (Note 6). A stream of nitrogen is then bubbled through the solution until the blue color disappears (~ 1 h). Solid triphenylphosphine (37.1 g, 141 mmol, 1.01 equiv) is added with stirring, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) and stirred for ~18 h until the ozonide test provides a negative result (Note 7). The solvent is removed by means of a rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C). Residual CH2Cl2 is removed by dissolving the crude mixture in diethyl ether (50 mL) and concentrating the solution on a rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C). This step is repeated twice, and the resulting yellow slurry is then placed under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) for 12 h. (Note 8). Diethyl ether (80 mL) is added, the solid/liquid mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min, and the solid is then filtered off by vacuum filtration using a B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with filter paper (Whatmann #1, 70 mm). The solid is rinsed with ice cold ether (2 \u00d7 15 mL). The ether filtrates are combined and transferred to a separatory funnel (250 mL) and extracted vigorously with water (4 \u00d7 80 mL) (Note 9). To a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing the combined aqueous extracts (~250 mL) is added solid NaCl (70 g) with stirring, followed by additional NaCl until the solution is saturated. The aqueous solution is transferred to a 50-mL separatory funnel and extracted with hexanes (2 \u00d7 100 mL) to remove unreacted cyclohexane dione monoketal from step A (Note 4). The aqueous solution is then transferred to a clean 1000-mL separatory funnel and extracted vigorously with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The aqueous solution is saturated again with additional sodium chloride (5 g) and extracted vigorously again with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined CH2Cl2 extracts are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (50 g) for 15 min, filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel equipped with filter paper (Whatman #1, 70 mm), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) to deliver a light yellow oil. Further concentration under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) provides 15.1 g (57%) of the aldehyde acid as a light yellow solid (Note 10), which is of sufficient purity for use in the subsequent step without further purification (Notes 11 and 12).",

Following the addition of CH2Cl2 (250 mL) and 2-chloropyridine (13.1 mL, 139 mmol, 1.0 equiv), the flask is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 \u00b0C, bath temperature) under nitrogen. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (25.0 g, 153 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is then added slowly via syringe over 10 min through the septum down the side of the flask to allow cooling prior to mixing with the bulk solvent. The cold bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) and stirred an additional 12 h, leading to a white precipitate. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) to deliver a white solid. Toluene (120 mL) is added to further induce precipitation, and after swirling under nitrogen for ~10 minutes, the toluene/CH2Cl2 mixture is removed from the solids via cannula under N2 pressure. The white solid is dried under reduced pressure at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h at 23 \u00b0C to afford 35.9 g (93%) of N-methyl-2-chloropyridinium trifluoromethane sulfonate (3) as a white solid (mp 147-148 \u00b0C) (Note 13).",

The reaction mixture changes from yellow to a dark red color during this addition. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 18 h at ambient temperature, and the reaction progress is monitored by the disappearance of aldehyde acid 2 and the formation of \u03b2-lactone 5 by TLC analysis (R f 0.29 and 0.52, respectively in 60% EtOAc/hexanes, KMnO4 stain). When the reaction is judged complete, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation and then by high vacuum (0.5 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) for 3 h to provide a dark brown, viscous oil (~ 75 g). The oil is diluted with 25 mL of CH2Cl2 and loaded onto a silica gel plug (188 g, 2.5 g silica gel per gram of crude product, 10-cm diameter flash column) pre-eluted with 50% EtOAc:hexanes, using a long stem funnel to carefully deliver the crude mixture onto the silica gel surface (washing with 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and then 10 mL of 50% EtOAc:hexanes).

Forty fractions (~45 mL in 50 mL test tubes) are collected and fractions 7-35 containing the majority of the \u03b2-lactone (R f = 0.52 (60% EtOAc:hexanes; KMnO4)) are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) and then under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg at 23 \u00b0C) to deliver 8.3 g of semi-crude \u03b2-lactone. Recrystallization (Note 15) from EtOAc:hexanes gives a total of 4.5 g (33%) of bicyclic-\u03b2-lactone (Notes 16 and 17). Enantiomeric excess was determined to be 90% ee by chiral HPLC analysis (Note 18)."

The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of methyl iodide (17.3 mL, 278 mmol, 2.20 equiv) (Note 4) in diethyl ether (25 mL) by means of a syringe. The methyl iodide solution is added dropwise to the magnesium turnings. The reaction is initiated, as evidenced by reflux, upon the addition of 4 mL of methyl iodide solution. The reaction mixture is immediately diluted with additional diethyl ether (35 mL) through the septum of the flask using a syringe. Addition of methyl iodide is continued at a rate of 1 mL/min to maintain a gentle reflux. After the addition is complete the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature.

An oven-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 5-cm, egg-shaped stir bar, a rubber septum, and a digital and traceable thermocouple (Note 1) is connected to an argon line and is charged with t-BuOK (20.0 g, 95% purity, 170 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) and anhydrous THF (85 mL) (Note 3) added by a syringe. This mixture is cooled to -78 \u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath, and then trans-2-butene (19.2 mL, 204 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 4), condensed from a gas lecture cylinder into a 25-mL graduated cylinder immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath, is added via cannula. n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 68.0 mL, 170.0 mmol) (Note 5) is added dropwise over 50 min using a syringe pump to make sure that the internal temperature does not rise above -65 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed, and the resultant yellow mixture is allowed to warm until the internal temperature reaches -50 \u00b0C (about 5 min). Then the reaction flask is quickly moved to an acetone bath precooled with dry ice to -50 \u00b0C. The internal temperature of the reaction solution is maintained between -50.0 \u00b0C to -50.5 \u00b0C for 25 min (Note 6) and then immediately recooled to -78 \u00b0C by moving the reaction flask to a dry ice/acetone bath.\nTriisopropylborate (39.9 mL, 98% purity, 170 mmol) (Note 7) is added dropwise over 50 min via a syringe pump to the above orange solution of (E)-crotylpotassium 1 to make sure that the internal temperature does not rise above -65 \u00b0C. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool until the internal temperature remains constant around -72.5 \u00b0C, maintained at this temperature for 10 min, and then rapidly poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 1N HCl solution (320 mL) saturated with NaCl and shaken vigorously. The aqueous layer is adjusted to pH 1 by adding 1N HCl solution (110 mL), and then a solution of (S,S)-diisopropyl tartrate ((S,S)-DIPT) (40.6 g, 98% purity, 170 mmol) (Note 8) in Et2O (60 mL) is added and the mixture is shaken vigorously. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (4 \u00d7 80 mL). The combined organic layers are dried with MgSO4 (120 g) over 2.5 h and then vacuum filtered through a fritted glass funnel under an argon blanket (Note 9) into a 1-L, oven-dried and pre-tared round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is washed with anhydrous Et2O (2 \u00d7 70 mL) (Note 10), and then the combined filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (from 40 mmHg to 10 mmHg at rt) to a colorless thick liquid, which is further concentrated on a vacuum line (0.5-1 mmHg) with stirring by a 5-cm, egg-shaped and pre-tared stir bar to constant weight (57 g). The crude product is dissolved in anhydrous toluene (120 mL) (Note 11) to form a clear solution (173 mL) of (S,S)-diisopropyl tartrate (E)-crotylboronate 2 (Note 12). The material so obtained has =98% isomeric purity (Note 13), the resulting toluene solution has a reagent concentration of 0.65 mol/L, and the yield of reagent is 66% according to titration analysis (Note 14).",

After a solution of (E)-crotylboronate 2 in toluene (72.0 mL, 0.69 mol/L, 49.7 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is added by syringe, the resulting mixture is stirred at rt for 30 min and then cooled to -78 \u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath. A solution of D-(R)-glyceraldehyde acetonide 3 (6.0 g, 90% purity, 41.5 mmol) (Note 16) in anhydrous toluene (15.0 mL) is added dropwise over 50 min (Note 17) via a syringe pump, and after completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 2.0 h (Note 18). The reaction is quenched by slowly adding aqueous 2 N NaOH (130 mL) over 5 min by syringe, then the cooling bath is removed. After ambient temperature is reached (about 1.5 h), the mixture is vigorously stirred for an additional 20 min. The toluene layer is separated, and then the reaction flask containing some solid residue is rinsed with Et2O (120 mL), which is then used to extract the aqueous solution. The same rinse and extraction operation is repeated two more times with Et2O (2 \u00d7 120 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), brine (2 \u00d7 100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 (120 g) and vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is concentrated (from 35 to 8 mmHg) by rotary evaporation at ambient temperature to give a colorless liquid, containing a >98% of 4 (Note 19). Purification of the product by flash column chromatography (Note 20) using ether/hexanes (1/4 to 1/3) as the eluent provides 5.1 g (66% yield) of (2R,3R,4R)-1,2-dideoxy-2-ethenyl-4,5-O-(1-methylethylidene)-xylitol 4 as a colorless oil (Note 21)."

N-(4-Bromobenzylidene)-1,1-diphenylmethanamine ( 1).2 A 250-mL round-bottomed flask with two 24/40 necks is fitted with a magnetic stir bar (20 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm), a rubber septum, and a 24/40 vacuum adapter. The flask is connected to a double manifold vacuum line with a nitrogen ballast. This assembly is flame-dried under high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) and cooled under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen. To this flask is then sequentially added 4-bromobenzaldehyde (11.84 g, 63.95 mmol, 1.1 equiv) and MgSO4 (14.0 g, 116 mmol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 1). This is followed by the addition of 60 mL dry dichloromethane (Note 1), via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle, along the neck and the sides of the flask such that all solids could be rinsed to the bottom of the flask. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (22 \u00b0C) under nitrogen to provide a white slurry. Aminodiphenylmethane (10.0 mL, 56.3 mmol at 97% purity, 1.00 equiv) is then added to the solution through the rubber septum, via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle (Note 1). The resulting white slurry is stirred at room temperature (22 \u00b0C) for 20 h, at which time the reaction is complete (Note 2). A different 250-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 single neck) is fitted with a filter adapter and a coarse porosity glass fritted funnel (60 mL, 4.5 \u00d7 5.5 cm) packed with Celite (1 cm height). The reaction mixture is filtered through the fritted funnel; the reaction flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 15 mL) three times, and the rinse is added to the funnel each time (Note 3). The fritted funnel and the Celite bed are then washed twice with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 15 mL). The fritted funnel is removed, the filter adapter is rinsed with 10 mL dichloromethane, and the solution of the crude product is then subjected to rotary evaporation until dryness (40 mmHg, 45 \u00b0C) followed by high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) for 3 h. This afforded the crude imine product as an off-white solid (21.36 g). For crystallization, the 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing the crude product is equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a water condenser, a rubber septum and nitrogen line. A mixture of ethyl acetate:hexanes (1:5) (35 mL) is prepared and a portion is poured into the flask to cover the solids (Note 4). The flask is placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C (bath temperature) and brought to reflux. The rest of the ethyl acetate:hexanes (1:5) mixture is then added slowly with continued boiling (total volume 35 mL). At this time, a clear pale yellow solution of the crude product is obtained, and the flask is placed on a wooden cork and left untouched for 19 h. The resulting crystals are then broken up into small pieces by a spatula, and these are collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel (6 cm d \u00d7 3.5 cm h). The crystallization flask is rinsed twice with cold (0 \u00b0C) hexanes (2 \u00d7 10 mL) and the rinse added each time to the B\u00fcchner funnel. The resulting crystals are transferred to a 50-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask and subjected to high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) for 4 h.

Thereafter, dry toluene (4 mL) (Note 1) is added along the sides of the Schlenk flask via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle, which had been pre-flushed with nitrogen. This is followed by the addition of water (1.8 \u03bcL, 0.10 mmol, 0.005 equiv) via a glass syringe (Note 11). The flask is then sealed, and the mixture is stirred at 80 \u00b0C in an oil bath (bath temperature) for 1 h. Thereafter, the valve on the double manifold connected to the Schlenk flask is turned to high vacuum (0.10 mmHg). While stirring is maintained, the threaded valve on the Schlenk flask is carefully and gradually opened to the high vacuum, and the solvent is removed (Note 12). After all solvent is removed, the Schlenk flask is allowed to remain at 80 \u00b0C in the oil bath for an additional 0.5 h exposed to high vacuum (Note 13). The flask is removed from the oil bath and cooled to room temperature under a slight positive pressure of argon (ca. 20 min) to afford the pre-catalyst as a colorless/off-white oil that adheres to the sides of the Schlenk flask. To this is added through the top of the flask, under a slight positive pressure of argon, imine 1 (7.00 g, 20 mmol, 1 equiv), followed by the addition of 20 mL of dry toluene along the sides of the Schlenk flask via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle (pre-flushed with nitrogen). The magnetic stir bar at this point is stuck to the Schlenk flask, the flask is swirled by hand until the stir bar became free (Note 14). Additional dry toluene (5 mL) is then added along the sides of the Schlenk flask, and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 5-10 min to obtain a clear pale yellow solution of the catalyst-imine complex. Under a slight positive pressure of argon, ethyl diazoacetate (2.5 mL, 24 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is then added to the Schlenk flask via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle (pre-flushed with nitrogen) (Note 10). The clear solution in the Schlenk flask turns dark yellow/orange with this addition, and vigorous nitrogen evolution is observed. Within 1 h, the product aziridine starts to precipitate, and the entire reaction mixture turns into a pale yellow semi-solid mass. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature under a slight positive pressure of argon for a total of 8 h, at which point the reaction is complete (Note 15).\nDichloromethane (30 mL) is added to the Schlenk flask (Note 3), and the resulting mixture is stirred to obtain a clear yellow solution of the crude aziridine product. The yellow solution is then added, via a glass funnel, to a pre-weighed 250-mL round-bottomed flask with a single neck (24/40 joint). The Schlenk flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 20 mL), the plastic funnel with dichloromethane (5 mL), and the rinse added each time to the round-bottomed flask. The solution is then subjected to rotary evaporation (40 mmHg, 45 \u00b0C) until ca. 25 mL of the crude product solution is left in the flask. Hexanes (50 mL) are added to the flask, and the solution is again subjected to rotary evaporation (40 mmHg, 45 \u00b0C) to dryness and finally to high vacuum (1.0 mm Hg) for 12 h to afford the crude aziridine product 2 as an off-white solid (8.52 g). The solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) to obtain a clear yellow solution, which is allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min. A different pre-weighed 150-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 single neck) is fitted with a filter adapter and a coarse porosity glass fritted funnel (30 mL, 3.5 \u00d7 5.0 cm) packed with Celite (1 cm height). The crude product solution is filtered through the fritted funnel; the flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 20 mL), and the rinses are added to the funnel. The sides of the fritted funnel and the Celite bed are washed with dichloromethane (20 mL). The fritted funnel is removed, the filter adapter is rinsed with dichloromethane (10 mL), and this crude product solution is then subjected to rotary evaporation to dryness (40 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) followed by high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) for 4 h. This process afforded the crude aziridine product 2 as an off-white solid.\nFor crystallization, the 150-mL round-bottomed flask containing the crude product is equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a water condenser, a rubber septum and connected to a nitrogen line. A mixture of dichloromethane:hexanes (1:3) (90 mL) is prepared, and a portion is poured into the flask that is just sufficient to cover the solids (Notes 3 and 4). The condenser is turned on and the flask is placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C (bath temperature). Once at reflux, more solvent is slowly added via a plastic syringe fitted with a metallic needle until all solids had dissolved (total volume 90 mL) and a clear pale yellow solution of the crude product is obtained. The crude product is placed on a wooden cork and left untouched for 1 h over which time some of the product crystallizes. The condenser is removed, and the crystallization flask is allowed to stand open to air at room temperature for an additional 27 h. After a total of 28 h, the supernatant is carefully decanted, so as to not disturb the crystals, into another 500-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 single neck) via a plastic funnel. Cold hexanes (-42 \u00b0C, 50 mL) is gently added to the crystallization flask, the flask is gently swirled by hand, and the supernatant solution is again added via decantation to the 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The hexane wash is repeated once more. Then, 80 mL of dichloromethane is added to the crystallization flask to completely dissolve the product crystals to afford a clear slightly pale yellow solution. An aliquot (1 mL) of this solution is taken and placed into an HPLC vial. The dichloromethane is evaporated by air. The product is dissolved in 2-propanol (1.5 mL) and the solution is subjected to chiral HPLC analysis, which reveals 99% ee for the first crop of aziridine (Note 16). The dichloromethane solution of the first crop in the 150-mL round-bottomed flask is then subjected to rotary evaporation until dryness (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and finally at high vacuum for 3-4 h to afford the first crop of aziridine 2 as a white solid (mp 154-155 \u00b0C) in 43% yield (3.77 g, 8.64 mmol) (Note 16).\nThe 500-mL round-bottomed flask with the mother liquor and the washes is then subjected to rotary evaporation to dryness (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg), and the resulting solids are dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and transferred to a different pre-weighed 150-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 single neck) via a glass funnel. The 500-mL round-bottomed flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 20 mL), and the glass funnel is rinsed with dichloromethane (10 mL). The rinses are added each time to the 150-mL round-bottomed flask. This mother liquor solution is then subjected to rotary evaporation until dryness (40 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and finally to high vacuum for 3-4 h to afford the crude aziridine product 2 as a pale yellow solid (6.32 g). A second crop is then taken from this material in the same manner as the first crop, except that a total volume of 35 mL of a 1:4 mixture of dichloromethane:hexanes is used for the crystallization. Two similar cold hexanes (-42 \u00b0C) washes are employed as in the first crop, with 25 mL of hexanes being used each time. The second crop of aziridine 2 is obtained as a white/off-white solid (mp 140-143 \u00b0C) in 47% yield (4.11 g, 9.42 mmol) and 83% ee. Thus, the overall yield of the reaction is 7.82 g (90%, 17.90 mmol) (Notes 17 and 18)."

            "4-Trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 1) in the left neck, a scaled 50-mL dropping funnel closed with a rubber septum on top in the middle neck, a rubber septum on the right neck and a magnetic stir bar (3 cm) is flame-dried, vented with argon and then allowed to cool to room temperature under argon atmosphere (Note 2). The rubber septum on the right is replaced by a low temperature thermometer. The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (150 mL) (Note 3), and 2-butyn-1-ol (1, 5.38 mL, 5.00 g, 69.9 mmol) (Note 4) is added. This solution is cooled to -70 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with a dry ice-acetone bath. Once cooled, n-butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes, 28.0 mL, 69.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise over the course of 80 min (Note 6), and afterwards the solution is stirred for an additional 10 min. Next, tert-butyllithium (1.7 M in pentane, 45.2 mL, 76.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 7) is added dropwise over the course of 60 min (Note 8). The solution develops a yellow color during the addition of the alkyllithium reagents. After the addition of tert-butyllithium is completed, the reaction mixture is slowly warmed to 0 \u00b0C during two hours by keeping the flask directly over the dry ice-acetone bath. Formation of a precipitate is first observed between -45 \u00b0C and -30 \u00b0C and the mixture becomes cloudier as the temperature warms towards 0 \u00b0C. After two hours, the reaction vessel is maintained at 0 \u00b0C for 20 min with an ice-water bath.\nThe dropping funnel is replaced by a rubber septum, and the reaction vessel is recooled to -70 \u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Trimethylsilyl chloride (17.7 mL, 15.2 g, 140 mmol, 2.0 equiv, Note 9) is added via syringe pump at 45 mL / h to the suspension of the dianionic intermediate. During this addition the color changes from dark yellow to light brown and the precipitate dissolves again (Note 10). The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight (16-17 h). The solution becomes orange, and a cream colored precipitate is formed during this period.\nThe reaction is then quenched by adding saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (100 mL) to the reaction mixture at room temperature, and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min. Water (100 mL) is added to dissolve the precipitated salts, and the mixture is stirred for additional 25 min. Diethyl ether (100 mL) is added to dilute the organic layer, and the layers are separated in a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 25 mL), and the combined organic layers are transferred to a round-bottomed flask and concentrated to ~75 mL by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 210 mmHg) (Note 11). To this solution, a magnetic stir bar (3 cm) is added and 8.73 M acetic acid (15 mL, 130 mmol) (Note 12) is added to cleave the trimethylsilyl ether. The reaction mixture is stirred for one hour until full conversion is achieved according to TLC analysis (Note 13). The reaction mixture is then neutralized by portionwise addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until the aqueous layer is slightly basic to pH paper (Note 14). The biphasic solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the organic layer is collected. The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 50 mL), the combined organic layers are washed with brine (1 x 100 mL) and then dried over magnesium sulfate. After vacuum filtration through a medium porosity fritted funnel packed with Celite and washing with diethyl ether (2 x 25 mL), the crude mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (35\u00b0 C, 150 mmHg) to give a yellow oil (Note 15).\nThis crude product is purified by vacuum distillation over the course of five to six hours at 75 mmHg. A vacuum distillation setup consisting of a oil bath, a flask charged with compound, a 40 cm silvered and vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column, a distillation head with condenser and an udder connected to four 25-mL round-bottomed flasks immersed in a ice-water bath is used (Note 16). At 45 \u00b0C and 75 mmHg the first fraction is collected, which consists of trimethylsilanol. Subsequently the oil bath temperature is slowly increased to 140 \u00b0C, and the distillate obtained during this period is combined with the first fraction. The boiling point reaches 115 \u00b0C before it then drops. Then the oil bath temperature is increased to 145 \u00b0C. At this temperature a mixture of side product and desired product with a boiling point of 121 \u00b0C is collected in the second fraction (~ 2 g). After 1.5 hours the oil bath temperature is increased to 150 \u00b0C. The desired product is collected in fraction three with a boiling point of 124 \u00b0C. A slow increase of the oil bath temperature to 165 \u00b0C, followed by a slow decrease of the pressure to 23 mmHg provides additional product in high purity, which is collected in fraction four (Note 17). The combined fractions three and four give the product, 4-trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2) in 35-37% yield (3.5-3.7 g) as colorless oil that is stored in the freezer at -20 \u00b0C (Notes 18 and 19). The identity of the product is confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and elemental analysis (Note 20).\n2. Notes\n1. A two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold is illustrated in Yu, J.; Truc, V.; Riebel, P.; Hierl, E.; Mudryk, B. Org. Synth. 2008, 85, 64-71.\n2. All steps prior to the aqueous ammonium chloride quench were conducted with careful exclusion of air and moisture, using argon as an inert atmosphere.\n3. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was stored over oven-dried 3\u00c5 molecular sieves under argon. Before each reaction, the water content of the THF was determined with a Denver Instruments Model 275KF Colorimetric Karl-Fischer Titrator to ensure less than 10 ppm water.\n4. 2-Butyn-1-ol (1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (98%) and used without further purification.\n5. n-Butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.\n6. n-Butyllithium was added discontinuously in order to keep the internal temperature between -70 \u00b0C and -65 \u00b0C. Slow addition was necessary since the reaction is highly exothermic. The submitters used a syringe pump with a flow rate of 60 mL / h for the addition of n-butyllithium.\n7. tert-Butyllithium (1.7 M in pentane) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. tert-Butyllithium is highly pyrophoric, and extra care should be taken in handling. tert-Butyllithum was transferred via cannula transfer to the dropping funnel under argon pressure using a stainless steel cannula.\n8. The internal temperature was kept between -70 \u00b0C and -65 \u00b0C during addition of tert-butyllithium. The submitters used a syringe pump with a flow rate of 60 mL / h for the addition of tert-butyllithium. However, Organic Syntheses recommends that addition of tert-butyllithium by syringe pump be avoided.\n9. Trimethylsilyl chloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (=98%) and used without further purification. This reagent is corrosive and evolves hydrochloric acid gas in the presence of moisture.\n10. The submitters observed a colorless solution after addition of the first equivalent of trimethylsilyl chloride. After addition of the second equivalent the submitters observed a light green solution.\n11. Pressure was set at 450 mmHg. When most of the diethyl ether was evaporated the pressure was reduced to 210 mmHg. The checkers observed formation of a light grey precipitate during evaporation of the solvent which dissolved again upon addition of aqueous acetic acid.\n12. This corresponds to a 50% aqueous solution of acetic acid. This reagent is corrosive.\n13. Thin layer chromatographic analysis was conducted with silica gel-coated polyester sheets (Macherey-Nagel), using cyclohexane : ethyl acetate (4 : 1) as eluent, and were developed with p-anisaldehyde / aqueous sulfuric acid. Under these conditions, the intermediate trimethylsilyl ether exhibited an Rf of 0.9 (and stained red) and the product alcohol (2) exhibited an Rf of 0.4 (and stained red). The submitters used hexanes : ethyl acetate (4 : 1) as eluent and observed the same Rf values.\n14. A volume of 150-160 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate was added.\n15. The diethyl ether was removed at 450 mmHg. Afterwards the pressure was stepwise reduced to 150 mmHg.\n16. The submitters used a 20 cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column and a pressure of 150 mmHg for the distillation. However in the checkers' hand a complete separation of the major side product and the product was not possible with this procedure. The removed side product was always obtained as a mixed fraction with the product. Due to the high temperatures during the six-hour distillation, formation of a decomposition product was observed which was difficult to separate. The checkers identified the major side product by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR being most likely the isomerized allene (2-(trimethylsilyl)buta-2,3-dien-1-ol).\n17. The submitters described an impurity at 119 \u00b0C (150 mmHg), followed by the product at 123 \u00b0C (150 mmHg).\n18. The submitters described the product as a stable, pale yellow oil. However the checkers observed the development of a yellow color and new peaks in 1H NMR upon storage of the product at room temperature.\n19. The checkers could isolate another 0.8-1.1 g of product by subjecting the mixed fraction two to flash column chromatography. Flash column chromatography was performed using a 5.5 cm wide and 22 cm high column packed with Fluka silica gel 60 (powder, 0.040-0.063 mm, 250 g) and 20 mL fractions. The eluent used was cyclohexane : ethyl acetate (6 : 1), with KMnO4 as TLC stain (Rf allene = 0.24, Rf product = 0.18, Rf impurity = 0.13). After a 250 mL forerun and five mixed fractions with the allene, pure product appeared in fractions 29-50.\n20.

Safety and Waste Disposal Information All hazardous materials should be handled and disposed of in accordance with \"Prudent Practices in the Laboratory\"; National Academy Press: Washington, DC, 1995. Specifically, aqueous and organic phase wastes (residual solvents) were separated before disposal, and solid wastes (MgSO4, Celite) were also separated before disposal. As standard operating procedure, personnel should wear safety glasses, a laboratory jacket, and latex gloves for each step.\n3. Discussion\nThe title compound, 4-trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2), was originally prepared by formylation of the metal acetylide arising from 3-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne (3, Figure 1).3\nFigure 1. Original synthesis of 4-trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2)\nIn our hands, we have found that yields are variable in the original procedure, as the formaldehyde (generated by heating paraformaldehyde) condenses and repolymerizes upon addition to the cold (-78 oC) alkynyllithium solution, thus blocking the inlet. Furthermore, 3-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne (3) is relatively expensive. The alternative preparation described here begins with commercially available 2-butyn-1-ol (1), beginning with sequential O- and C-deprotonation followed by double silylation of (5), and concluding with chemoselective hydrolysis of the silyl ether (6, Figure 2).4\nFigure 2. This synthesis of 4-trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2), depicting key intermediates\nThe alcohol of the title compound (2) can be converted into several other functional groups, such as the aldehyde (7, Figure 3),3b as well as conversion into electrophilic derivatives for formation of carbon-carbon,4,5,6 carbon-nitrogen,7 carbon-oxygen,8 and carbon-tin bonds.9 The internal\nFigure 3. Functionalization of the alcohol of (2)\nalkyne can also be converted into the trans- or cis-alkenes (14, 15, Figure 4), as functionalized allylic silane reagents.3c,10 Lewis acid-promoted protonation of (2) affords 2,3-butadien-1-ol (16).11 The hydroxyl group directs hydrostannylation to the proximal carbon of the alkyne, to afford the Z-vinylstannane (17) under kinetic conditions.12 The propargylic silane serves as a nucleophile upon Lewis acid-promoted reactions with aldehydes to provide functionalized allenes (18), (20), and (21, Figure 5).3a,8,13 The corresponding transformations with acetals and N-acylaminals have also been reported.14 15\nFigure 4. Functionalization of the alkyne of (2)\nFigure 5. Intermolecular additions of propargylic silanes arising from (2)\nSeveral Br\u00f8nsted acid-promoted intramolecular cyclizations have also been accomplished with propargylic silanes arising from (2), tethered to aldehydes (24) or N-acylaminals (26), forming the corresponding cyclic structures bearing exocyclic allenes (25, 27, Figure 6).8,16 Moreover, Lewis acid-promoted cyclizations have also been reported in conjugate additions with (11) as well as polyepoxide-alkene cyclizations from (29), to provide the corresponding exocyclic allenes (28, 30).4,7\nFigure 6.

            "4-Trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 1) in the left neck, a scaled 50-mL dropping funnel closed with a rubber septum on top in the middle neck, a rubber septum on the right neck and a magnetic stir bar (3 cm) is flame-dried, vented with argon and then allowed to cool to room temperature under argon atmosphere (Note 2). The rubber septum on the right is replaced by a low temperature thermometer. The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (150 mL) (Note 3), and 2-butyn-1-ol (1, 5.38 mL, 5.00 g, 69.9 mmol) (Note 4) is added. This solution is cooled to -70 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with a dry ice-acetone bath. Once cooled, n-butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes, 28.0 mL, 69.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise over the course of 80 min (Note 6), and afterwards the solution is stirred for an additional 10 min. Next, tert-butyllithium (1.7 M in pentane, 45.2 mL, 76.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 7) is added dropwise over the course of 60 min (Note 8). The solution develops a yellow color during the addition of the alkyllithium reagents. After the addition of tert-butyllithium is completed, the reaction mixture is slowly warmed to 0 \u00b0C during two hours by keeping the flask directly over the dry ice-acetone bath. Formation of a precipitate is first observed between -45 \u00b0C and -30 \u00b0C and the mixture becomes cloudier as the temperature warms towards 0 \u00b0C. After two hours, the reaction vessel is maintained at 0 \u00b0C for 20 min with an ice-water bath.",
            "The dropping funnel is replaced by a rubber septum, and the reaction vessel is recooled to -70 \u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Trimethylsilyl chloride (17.7 mL, 15.2 g, 140 mmol, 2.0 equiv, Note 9) is added via syringe pump at 45 mL / h to the suspension of the dianionic intermediate. During this addition the color changes from dark yellow to light brown and the precipitate dissolves again (Note 10). The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight (16-17 h). The solution becomes orange, and a cream colored precipitate is formed during this period.",
            "The reaction is then quenched by adding saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (100 mL) to the reaction mixture at room temperature, and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min. Water (100 mL) is added to dissolve the precipitated salts, and the mixture is stirred for additional 25 min. Diethyl ether (100 mL) is added to dilute the organic layer, and the layers are separated in a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 25 mL), and the combined organic layers are transferred to a round-bottomed flask and concentrated to ~75 mL by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 210 mmHg) (Note 11). To this solution, a magnetic stir bar (3 cm) is added and 8.73 M acetic acid (15 mL, 130 mmol) (Note 12) is added to cleave the trimethylsilyl ether. The reaction mixture is stirred for one hour until full conversion is achieved according to TLC analysis (Note 13). The reaction mixture is then neutralized by portionwise addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until the aqueous layer is slightly basic to pH paper (Note 14). The biphasic solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the organic layer is collected. The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 50 mL), the combined organic layers are washed with brine (1 x 100 mL) and then dried over magnesium sulfate. After vacuum filtration through a medium porosity fritted funnel packed with Celite and washing with diethyl ether (2 x 25 mL), the crude mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (35\u00b0 C, 150 mmHg) to give a yellow oil (Note 15).",
            "This crude product is purified by vacuum distillation over the course of five to six hours at 75 mmHg. A vacuum distillation setup consisting of a oil bath, a flask charged with compound, a 40 cm silvered and vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column, a distillation head with condenser and an udder connected to four 25-mL round-bottomed flasks immersed in a ice-water bath is used (Note 16). At 45 \u00b0C and 75 mmHg the first fraction is collected, which consists of trimethylsilanol. Subsequently the oil bath temperature is slowly increased to 140 \u00b0C, and the distillate obtained during this period is combined with the first fraction. The boiling point reaches 115 \u00b0C before it then drops. Then the oil bath temperature is increased to 145 \u00b0C. At this temperature a mixture of side product and desired product with a boiling point of 121 \u00b0C is collected in the second fraction (~ 2 g). After 1.5 hours the oil bath temperature is increased to 150 \u00b0C. The desired product is collected in fraction three with a boiling point of 124 \u00b0C. A slow increase of the oil bath temperature to 165 \u00b0C, followed by a slow decrease of the pressure to 23 mmHg provides additional product in high purity, which is collected in fraction four (Note 17). The combined fractions three and four give the product, 4-trimethylsilyl-2-butyn-1-ol (2) in 35-37% yield (3.5-3.7 g) as colorless oil that is stored in the freezer at -20 \u00b0C (Notes 18 and 19). The identity of the product is confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and elemental analysis (Note 20)."

A flame-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 5.0 cm magnetic stir bar, an internal thermometer, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a rubber septum containing nitrogen inlet and outlet needles. The flask is charged with tosyl chloride (9.55 g, 50.1 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 1), dichloromethane (125 mL) (Note 2), and triethylamine (7.65 mL, 5.56 g, 55.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 3), resulting in a colorless solution. The solution is cooled to 19 \u00b0C (internal temperature) in a water bath. To this solution is added, dropwise over 70 min by means of the addition funnel, a well mixed yellow solution of 3-butyn-2-ol (4.00 mL of 97% solution, 3.50 g, 50.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 4) and triphenylphosphine (13.1 g, 50.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 5) in 125 mL of dichloromethane, during which time the reaction solution turns a pale yellow color. The rate of the addition is adjusted so as to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture at 19 \u00b0C. The reaction is run under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and monitored by TLC. After the disappearance of starting material, the solution is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) to a volume of about 50 mL. Ether/hexanes (200 mL/1:4) (Notes 6 and 7) is added to the flask. Upon swirling by hand, a voluminous amount of white solid (triethylamine hydrochloride salt) forms, which is filtered through a short silica gel column (40 g of silica in a 150-mL sintered glass funnel) (Note 8). Diethyl ether (150 mL) is used in three portions to rinse the flask and the solid. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a faint yellow oil. The crude oil is purified by silica gel column chromatography. The product is charged on a column (5 x 18 cm) of 150 g of silica gel and eluted with 1:4 ether/hexanes (1000 mL). Collection of 25 mL fractions begins immediately, and the desired product is obtained in fractions 15-38. The product-containing fractions are combined in a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated in vacuo by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) to afford 9.64 g (93%) of a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers of but-3-yn-2-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfinate as a faint yellow (almost colorless) oil (Note 9).",

After the flask has cooled to room temperature, it is charged with silver hexafluoroantimonate (266 mg, 0.774 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 10) and protected by a nitrogen atmosphere. The but-3-yn-2-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfinate (8.05 g, 38.7 mmol, 1 equiv) in 77 mL of dichloromethane (0.5 M) is introduced to the flask containing silver hexafluoroantimonate via cannula over 3 min. The reaction is run under a nitrogen atmosphere and monitored by TLC. After the disappearance of starting material (within 10 min), the contents are passed through a short silica gel plug (10 g silica gel in a 60 mL sintered glass filter funnel) and the pad of silica is rinsed with 100 mL of diethyl ether. After concentration of the filtrate on a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg), the residue is put on a high vacuum pump to remove trace amounts of solvent to provide 7.93 g (98.5%) of 1-(buta-1,2-dien-1-ylsulfonyl)-4-methylbenzene as a faint yellow oil. The oil is mixed with 50 mL of 1:4 diethyl ether/hexane (10 mL/40 mL) in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask. The solution is cooled to -20 \u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 22 h, and the resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration on a 60-mL sintered glass funnel quickly so as to not allow the filtrate to warm too much. The flask and the crystals are rinsed using cold hexanes (100 mL). The crystals are transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and dried under high vacuum pump to afford 7.73 g (96%) of a white solid (Note 11)."

After the addition, the rubber septum is replaced with a condenser fitted with a gas adapter connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. The mixture is refluxed using a heating mantle for 12 h (Note 9). At the end of the reaction, the suspension is cooled to room temperature, filtered through a 60-mL medium-porosity sintered glass funnel, and the filter cake is washed with THF (2\u00d725 mL). The combined filtrates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 20 mmHg) in a 500-mL round bottomed flask and further dried under vacuum (20 mmHg) for 3 h to provide 2 (7.7 g, estimated 65% purity, 5.0 assay g, 90% yield) as a pink foam which is used directly in the next step (Notes 10-12).",

The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 20 mmHg) to ~80 mL, then silica gel (30 g) is added, and the mixture is evaporated to a free-flowing powder. The material is purified by column chromatography (Note 19) with a final concentration in a 250-mL round bottom flask. The material is dried under vacuum (room temperature, 20 mmHg, 14 h) to provide 3 as a white solid (3.9-4.1 g).

This stability, however, can sometimes be problematic for protecting group removal, often requiring harsh conditions. The 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethanesulfonyl (SES) group provides a sulfonamide that combines the compatibility with many synthetic transformations with relatively benign removal conditions.

A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, an internal thermometer and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (capped with a rubber septum), is flame-dried and purged with argon. Degassed THF (200 mL) (Note 1) is added and subsequently granular lithium (6.63 g, 956 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2). The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of freshly sublimed \u03b1,\u03b1'-dibromo-o-xylene (101 g, 382 mmol) in degassed THF (150 mL) (Note 3). This solution is then added dropwise to the stirred suspension of granular lithium over a period of 1.5 h, which begins to reflux after 20 min. During the period of addition the internal temperature of the mixture is kept between 65 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C (Note 4). After complete addition, the mixture is refluxed for 2 h (oil bath) until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the substrate (Notes 5, 6 and 7).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then, for removal of residual lithium, filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5.0 cm diameter, porosity 0) under an atmosphere of argon. The funnel is subsequently rinsed with THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at a bath temperature of 40 \u00b0C (255-225 mmHg) and then at 50 \u00b0C (7.5 mmHg) for 1 h in order to remove THF (Note 8). Dichloromethane (700 mL) is added to the residue. After stirring for 2 min, insoluble material (Note 9) is removed by filtration with a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 4) filled with silica gel (100 g) (Note 10). The residue is washed with dichloromethane (700 mL) and the filtrate dried over Na2SO4 (50 g). The latter is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (675-525 mmHg and then 15 mmHg) for 1 h. The crude product remains as a pale yellow semifluidic mass (40.5 g), which solidifies under vacuum overnight (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg). Finally, the product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-175 \u00b0C, 0.25 mmHg) (Note 11) to yield pure 1 (19.6 g, 49%) as colorless plates (Note 12).",

The hot suspension (65 \u00b0C) is filtered through a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), and the remaining succinimide is washed with carbon tetrachloride (400 mL) (Note 18). The solvent of the filtrate is evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 225 to 18 mmHg). A pale yellow residue remains, which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask, poured into a fritted glass funnel (7.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), washed with distilled water (300 mL) and dried overnight under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg) to give 35.4 g of crude 2 as a pale yellow solid (Note 19).",

Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 2 (34.1 g crude product) is dissolved in THF (150 mL) (Note 1). Under an atmosphere of argon in a second flame-dried, 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium tert-butoxide (41.6 g, 371 mmol, 4 equiv, assuming 100% purity of 2) (Note 20) is dissolved in THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The resulting cloudy solution is then cooled with an ice bath. At 0 \u00b0C the solution of 2 is transferred through a teflon tube (1.5 mm internal diameter) over a period of 15 min into the 500-mL flask. During the period of addition the color changes from orange to brown and finally to black. Then the ice bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 2 h until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the dibromide 2 (Notes 21 and 22). Distilled water (15 mL) is added and the black mixture is poured onto a pad of silica gel (diameter 10 cm x 4 cm height) that has already been wetted with diethyl ether. The pad is rinsed with 700 mL of diethyl ether, and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction, dried over Na2SO4 (40 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 \u00b0C by rotary evaporation (675 to 75 mmHg) and then at 15 mmHg for 1 h. The crude product remains as a brown solid (18.5 g) (Note 23), which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask and dried overnight under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg).

            "Although many convenient and reliable precursors of benzyne have been prepared and utilized in organic synthesis,2 a hypervalent iodine-containing molecule, (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2) , has been developed for service as an efficient and mild benzyne precursor. The major developments over the past years have been the improvement of methods of synthesis of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor and the applications to related reactive intermediates. The summary will be reported in this Discussion Addendum.\nImprovement of Hypervalent Iodine Precursor\n2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2 generates benzyne more efficiently than other benzyne precursors such as benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate, o-dihalobenzenes (1,2-bromofluorobenzene and 1,2-dibromobenzene), and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate. The efficiency of this benzyne precursor 2 is attributable to the high leaving group ability of hypervalent iodine groups, which has been discussed previously.3 Hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor 2 was prepared in two steps from inexpensive and commercially available 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Initial preparation of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) by reaction of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Me3SiCl in the presence of Mg and a catalytic amount of I2 in HMPA is followed by transformation into 2 by the reaction with PhI(OAc)2 activated with TfOH in CH2Cl2. However, several drawbacks remained: (1) use of toxic HMPA solvent and severe conditions for the preparation of 1, (2) difficulty for introduction of functional groups, and (3) low solubility of the hypervalent iodine species in most organic solvents.\nTo improve the reaction procedure, an alternative benzyne precursor, 2-(hydroxydimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate (5), has been prepared in three steps starting with 1,2-dibromobenzene.4 This process avoids the use of carcinogenic HMPA and severe reaction conditions (high temperature and long reaction time). The reaction of 5 with Bu4NF under mild conditions generates benzyne efficiently, which provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. Therefore, 5 is a convenient alternative benzyne precursor. Incorporation of synthetically important carbonyl groups into hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors is difficult, because carbonyl groups cannot tolerate Grignard conditions. Synthesis of benzyne precursors bearing the carbonyl groups has been accomplished using pyran-2-ones as starting materials. Reaction of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with methyl 2-pyrone-5-carboxylate or 5-acylpyran-2-ones at 200 \u00b0C in a sealed tube affords the corresponding methyl 3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzoate5 or 1-acyl-3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-benzenes6 in good to high yields, which can be converted to 2-(trimethylsilyl)-phenyliodonium triflates 6, which contain carbonyl groups, by treatment with PhI(OAc)2 and TfOH. Treatment of 6 with Bu4NF in CH2Cl2 generates benzynes that contain ketone functionality, and reaction with furan provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. In general, hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors are stable solids and easy to handle, but they do not dissolve in most organic solvents. To improve the solubility of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, long-chained precursors (7) have been synthesized.7 As the alkyl chain of benzyne precursors 7 is lengthened, the solubility in non-polar organic solvents and the yield of the benzyne adduct with furan gradually increases.\nFigure 1.Improvements of synthetic procedures for hypervalent iodine precursors.\n1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) is the key starting material for the synthesis of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2. Recent improvement on the synthesis of 1 have been reported in which 1,2-dibromobenzene is used instead of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The use of Rieke magnesium or Mg turnings/1,2-dibromoethane8 and Fe-catalyzed DIBAL-H activated Grignard reaction have led to improved reactions.9 Through these variations, severe reaction conditions and the use of toxic HMPA solvent can be avoided.\nFigure 2. Improvements of synthesis of 1.\nOther Applications Using Hypervalent Iodine\nWhen hypervalent iodine and silyl groups are contiguous, fluoride ion can trigger the concerted elimination reaction of these two groups. This method is applicable not only to the generation of benzyne, but also to the generation of reactive intermediates related to benzyne. Thus, 2,3-didehydronaphthalene (8),10 bicycle[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-yne (9),11 dehydro-o-carborene (10),12 2,3-didehydrothiphene (11),13 and 2,3-didehydropyrrole (12)14 have been generated by this method. Benzobisoxadisiloles have been applied to synthesis of hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, which can serve as the synthetic equivalents of 1,4-benzdiyne (13) and related species.15\nFigure 3. Generation of benzyne-related species using hypervalent iodine/silane methodology."

            "The authors have applied hydration conditions for the reaction of 1,6-heptadiynes to form cyclohexenones.2 Various substituents at the 4-position of 1,6-heptadiynes are tolerated to give 5-substituted 3-methylcyclohex-2-enones.\nScheme 1 Hydrative Cyclization of 1,6-Diynes\nThe formation of the six-membered ring instead of the dihydration is attributed to the elimination of the ring from the monohydrated intermediate\nFigure 1 Catalytic Cycle of Hydrative Cyclization\ncomplex. A similar reaction has been reported in supported mercury-catalyzed hydration of 1,6-heptadiyne.3\n2,6-Heptanedione is prepared through reduction of 2,6-lutidine4 or methylation of methylperoxycyclopentanone.5\nScheme 2 Syntheses of 2,6-Heptanedione\n\u03b1,\u03c9-Diynes of C8 to C10 are dihydrated to give the corresponding diketones. Recently developed gold-carbene complexes,6 7 as well as cationic iridium complexes with the aid of GdCl3,8 catalyze the reaction. Indium complexes also dihydrate \u03b1,\u03c9-diynes of C9, C10, and C14 in the presence of diphenyldiselenide.9\nFigure 2 New Dihydration Catalysts for \u03b1,\u03c9-Diynes\nWacker-type oxidation of \u03b1,\u03c9-dienes should be an industrially better process to form the corresponding diketones. However, the selectivity and reactivity are not high enough, with the diketone selectivities of Pd(OAc)2/molybdovanadophosphate system10 being 40-60%. PdCl2/N,N-dimethylacetamide system11 gives the mixture of diketone and monoketone.\nScheme 3 Wacker-Type Oxidation of \u03b1,\u03c9-Dienes\nRecent progress in the catalysis of alkyne hydration utilizes cationic gold complexes,6,7,12,13 gold-carbene complexes,6,14,15 and water-soluble gold complexes.16 The application of these catalyst systems to dihydration of diynes gives the diketones.\nFigure 3 New Hydration Catalysts for Alkynes\nFor industrial application, heterogeneous catalysts are required. Those including {[NP(O2C12H8)]0.85[NP(OC6H4PPh2)2(AuPF6)0.5]0.15},17 tin-tungsten mixed oxide,18 and Hg(II)/silica3 have been developed to have high activity and selectivity for the hydration of alkynes.\nNeutral, metal-free hydration catalysis has been discovered by Abbott researchers.19 They have reported that the hydration of alkynes proceeds with microwave irradiation in superheated water. On the other hand, graphene oxide has been reported to catalyze the reaction without metal components as an example of carbocatalysts.20 These new systems have not been applied to the dihydration of diynes.\nAs for dihydration of \u03b1,\u03c9-diynes, mononuclear gold complex systems with some Br\u00f8nsted acids still seem the catalysts of choice at the present moment."

            "A. 4-[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-ethylamino]-3-nitrobenzoic acid ethyl ester (3). A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm) (Note 1).The flask is charged with ethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate 1 (5.00 g, 21.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) and anhydrous DMSO (20 mL) (Note 3). To this homogeneous yellow mixture, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine 2 (4.04 mL, 23.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. As soon has the first drop is added, the reaction mixture quickly changes to a dark reddish-orange color, but the mixture remains homogeneous throughout the addition without detectable exotherm. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (5.31 mL, 30.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise (1-2 min), which results in a slight cloudiness, but no exotherm is detected during or after addition. The flask is closed with a septum (Note 6) and the reaction mixture is stirred in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C. During the warming process, the dark reddish-orange color lightens somewhat, but the mixture remains cloudy. The reaction is stirred for 18 h at 70 \u00b0C after which time the dark reddish-orange reaction mixture is homogeneous. The reaction is judged to be complete by the disappearance of the starting ester by TLC (Note 7). The mixture is cooled to room temperature (Note 8) and de-ionized water (2 mL) is added dropwise with a Pasteur pipette over a period of ca. 2-3 min with efficient stirring while a persistent cloudiness develops. Precipitation/crystallization of the product occurs rapidly after the addition, giving rise to a very thick dark-red suspension (Note 1). After formation of the suspension, water (150 mL) is added in 10 mL portions over a period of ca. 5 min. During the addition of water the mixture becomes slightly warm to the touch. The resulting dark-orange to dark-yellow suspension of product is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h. The solids are collected by suction-filtration on filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with four portions of water (20 - 30 mL each). The solids are allowed to dry for ca. 1-2 h under air suction on the filter funnel. The solids are then collected and placed under vacuum (2 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 7.92-7.98 g (97-98% yield) of a red-orange to dark yellow solid (Note 10) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "B. Ethyl 3-amino-4-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)benzoate (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm). The flask is charged with nitro compound 3 (7.00 g, 18.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and methanol (285 mL) (Note 12). The flask is then fitted with a 3-way gas inlet adapter with an argon-filled balloon attached to one of the arms. While stirring the resultant yellow suspension, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). While stirring under a blanket atmosphere of argon, the adapter on the flask is briefly removed and Pearlman's catalyst (500 mg, (Note 14)) is added as a suspension in methanol (10 mL + 5 mL rinse). The argon balloon is then replaced with another balloon filled with hydrogen gas and, while stirring the mixture, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with hydrogen gas three times (Note 13). The dark yellow-black suspension is allowed to stir under the hydrogen atmosphere for a period of 24 h, after which TLC analysis indicate the disappearance of compound 3 (Note 15). The hydrogen balloon is once again replaced with an argon-filled balloon and the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). The 3-way stopper is then removed, Celite 545(r) (10g) (Note 16) is added and the suspension stirred under the argon blanket for 10 min. The solid is removed by suction filtration over filter paper (Note 17) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with two portions of methanol (20 - 30 mL each). The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 \u00b0C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid (Note 18) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "C. 2-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-1-[2-(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)- ethyl]-1 H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6). A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 19), DMF (30 mL) (Note 20) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) (Note 21) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 \u00b0C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4 (Note 11). The stirred mixture (Note 22) is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) (Note 23) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid (Note 25). The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) (Note 26) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid (Notes (Note 24) and (Note 27)). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper (Note 28) and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 29). The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid (Note 30)."

            "Reductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful methodology primarily because its products are excellent substrates for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Since 2003, the Organic Syntheses article and the primary references have been cited over 100 times. This discussion addendum aims to provide a brief overview of recent developments in this methodology. Improvements and variations of \u03b1-acetoxy ether formation, as well as the synthetic utility of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers will be discussed. Recent applications in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products are also included.\nImprovements and Variations of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ether Formation\nThe original reductive acetylation protocol involves the addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBALH) as a 1.0 M solution in hexanes to the ester at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting aluminum alkoxide is then treated with pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) sequentially. The internal temperature during these additions should not exceed -72 \u00b0C in order to maximize the yield and prevent undesired side reactions.2 While this method is general, recent developments include the use of asymmetric electrophiles in order to generate more complex acyl ethers and the extension of reductive acetylation to lactams and imides.\nShortly after the original article, Rovis and Zhang reported the use of acid fluorides as competent reagents for the trapping of such aluminum alkoxides, the results of which are summarized in Figure 1.3 Aryl, vinyl, and alkyl acid fluorides are all effective trapping reagents (67-97% yield) and steric bulk is well tolerated (pivaloyl fluoride = 92% yield). This development allows access to more complex acyl acetal derivatives without sacrificing a full equivalent of the acid, which represents an improvement in atom economy over the use of symmetric anhydrides.\nFigure 1. Acid Fluorides as Trapping Reagents.\nMore recently, Dalla and co-workers have extended reductive acetylation strategy to the formation of \u03b1-acetoxy pyrrolidines (Figure 2).4 While DIBALH will reduce imides, the resultant aluminum alkoxide is not nucleophilic enough to react with acetic anhydride. Therefore, the reductant of choice for the preparation of \u03b1-acetoxy amines is lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH), whose lithium alkoxide is sufficiently nucleophilic for effective trapping with acetic anhydride.\nFigure 2. Formation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Pyrrolidines.\nA variety of N-alkylated imides, shown in Figure 3, afford \u03b1-acetoxy lactams in high yields (75-100%), with the notable exception of cases where there is \u03b1-branching with respect to the nitrogen substituent (e.g. the imide of \u03b1-methylbenzylamine, MeBn). Steric bulk on the imide also limits the conversion to the \u03b1-acetoxy lactams, as shown by the modest yield for the bis-OTBS imide. Despite these limitations, this reductive acetylation strategy offers rapid entry into N-acylimium ions for use in Mannich reactions.\nFigure 3. \u03b1-Acetoxy Lactams from Imides.\nSynthetic Utility of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nTreatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers with a Lewis acid (commonly BF3\u00b7OEt2, MgBr2\u00b7OEt2, TMSOTf, SnCl4 or TiCl4) results in the formation of an oxocarbenium ion, which can be intercepted by a variety of nucleophiles to afford a new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond adjacent to an ether linkage. The scope of such transformations has been investigated in the context of diastereoselective nucleophilic additions. \u03b1-Acetoxy ethers are also useful substrates for cascade sequences, such as oxonia Cope-Prins and Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclizations. The use of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet Spengler reactions have also been examined.\nThe use of \u03b1-(trimethylsilyl)benzyl alcohol as a chiral auxiliary has been investigated by Rychnovsky and Crossrow for diastereoselective additions to oxocarbenium ions generated from \u03b1-acetoxy ethers.5 This chiral auxiliary was chosen due to the ease of preparation of both enantiomers and facile deprotection or conversion to the benzyl ether. Treatment of the \u03b1-acetoxy ether with a variety of nucleophiles, including allyl silanes, silyl enol ethers, and silyl ketene acetals, in the presence of TMSOTf proceed in high yields (87-98%) and high diastereoselectivities (20:1 to 80:1), as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, (E)-crotyltrimethylsilane affords the syn product in high yield and diastereoselectivity (82%, 27:2.4:1). The addition of cyanide and ethyl nucleophiles proceed in high yields (97% and 75% respectively), albeit with modest diastereoselectivity (5:1 and 4:1).\nFigure 4. Diastereoselective Additions of Nucleophiles.\nRychnovsky and Dalgard have reported on the expedient synthesis of tetrahydropyranones through an oxonia Cope-Prins cyclization.6 This strategy, outlined in Figure 5, involves a reductive acetylation of an ester 1, followed by treatment with TMSOTf to generate oxocarbenium ion 3. The pendant allyl moiety participates in a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to generate oxocarbenium ion 4, which is poised for a Prins cyclization (intramolecular Mukaiyama aldol reaction) with the silyl enol ether to afford tetrahydropyranone 5. This transformation is effective for a variety of substrates (Figure 6) affording the tetrahydropyranone product in high yields (77-99%), including those bearing quaternary centers adjacent to the ketone.\nFigure 5. 2-Oxonia Cope-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 6. Synthesis of Tetrahydropyranones.\nRovis and Epstein have also utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in a cascade sequence to provide 4-amino tetrahydropyrans through a Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclization.7 As shown in Figure 7, treatment of 4-acetoxy-1,3-dioxane 6 with TMSOTf generates oxocarbenium ion 7, which upon treatment with allyl silane affords alkene 8. In the presence of TfOH, acetal cleavage results in formation of oxocarbenium ion 9, which undergoes a Prins cyclization to give carbocation 10. Addition of a nitrile to the carbocation affords 4-amino tetrahydropyran 11 after hydrolysis.\nFigure 7. Sakurai-Ritter-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 8. Synthesis of 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nThe Sakurai-Ritter-Prins reaction is effective for a variety of dioxane derivatives, as shown in Figure 8. This transformation affords the 4-amino tetrahydropyran products in good yields (59-88%) and high diastereoselectivies (90:10 to 99:1). It should be noted that 2-substituted allyl silanes (Figure 9) and a variety of nitriles are effective partners in this transformation.7\nFigure 9. Synthesis of Quaternary 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nJacobsen and Doyle have utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers as substrates in the development of enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet-Spengler reactions (Figure 10).8 An ester derivative of tryptophol was reduced and trapped to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 12. In the presence of a thiourea catalyst 13, TMSCl, and BaO, oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent ring closure afforded tetrahydropyrano-indole 14 in good yield (82%) and good enantiomeric excess (79%).\nFigure 10. Organocatalytic Asymmetric Oxa-Pictet-Spengler Cyclization.\nHighlighted Applications in the Total Synthesis of Complex Natural Products: Intramolecular Allylation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nKadota, Yamamoto and co-workers utilized reductive acetylation to unite two complex fragments in their highly convergent synthesis of marine neurotoxin gambierol (19).9 The strategy, shown in Scheme 1, begins with the coupling of ABC acid to FGH alcohol via Yamaguchi esterification. The resulting ester 15 is then subjected to reductive acetylation conditions. While\nScheme 1. Kadota and Yamamoto's Total Synthesis of Gambierol.\nAc2O is an effective trapping reagent, chloroacetic anhydride provided increased yield and proper diastereoselectivity for the subsequent ring closure. Treatment of the resulting \u03b1-acetoxy ether 16 with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves afforded effective closure of the 6-membered D ring in high yield (87%) and modest diastereoselectivity (2:1) with respect to the acyclic ether. The resulting diene 17 is primed for a ring closing metathesis to forge the 7-membered E ring. The complex polycyclic ether framework 18 was then further elaborated to gambierol (19).\nScheme 2. Kadota's Total Synthesis of Brevenal.\nA similar approach was employed in Kadota and co-worker's total synthesis of the nontoxic brevetoxin antagonist brevenal (23).10 As shown in Scheme 2, the 7-membered D ring arose from the reductive chloroacetylation of ester 20, followed by treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 21 with magnesium bromide etherate and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieves. The resulting oxocarbenium ion was then trapped by the allyl stannane to afford the tetracycle 22 in good yield as a single diastereomer (52% from the ester 20). This cyclization again sets the stage for a ring closing metathesis sequence to afford a pentacycle, which was elaborated to brevenal (23).\nThe authors also reported a second-generation strategy (Scheme 3) where acyclic a0cid 24 is coupled to ABC alcohol 25.10-b This route employs the same reduction/cyclization sequence to forge the E ring in good yield as the single desired diastereomer (57% from the ester 26) and sets up the closure of the D ring in an analogous fashion.\nScheme 3. Kadota's Second Generation Strategy to Brevenal.\nRecently, the total synthesis of ciguatoxin CTX3C (34) by Yamashita and co-workers employed reductive acetylation to facilitate a radical cyclization to give the C ring of tridecacyclic natural product (Scheme 4).11 The AB acid and E alcohol were subjected to Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the ester 29. Following reductive acetylation, \u03b1-acetoxy ether 30 underwent transacetylation in the presence of diisobutylaluminum phenylselenide to afford the \u03b1-seleno ether 31 in high yield (83% from the ester). The \u03b1-seleno ether 31 was carried through 3 steps before C-ring radical cyclization was initiated by triethylborane and oxygen in the presence of tributyltin hydride to provide sulfoxide 33 in good yield as a single diastereomer (86%). This approach offered increased stereoselectivity over a direct allylation strategy (as in gamberiol). Sulfoxide 33 was then carried forward to afford ciguatoxin CTX3C (34).\nReductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful method for the construction of complex cyclic ethers via intramolecular allylation. The strategy has played a key role in the preparation of brevetoxin-like ladder polyethers.12 The method's utility is largely due to the ease with which substrates can be brought together by a Yamaguchi esterification. This protocol allows for a highly convergent and flexible approach to these marine natural products.\nScheme 4. Yamashita's Total Synthesis of Ciguatoxin CTX3C.\nIntermolecular Couplings of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers and Silyl Enol Ethers\nCrimmins and DeBaillie utilized reductive acetylation to install the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety of the tetrahydropyran fragment of the marine cytotoxin bistramide A (38).13 The synthetic strategy is outlined in Scheme 5. The lactone 35 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (7:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 with (E)-3-penten-2-one in the presence of excess TMSOTf led to formation of tetrahydropyran 37, a key building block for the synthesis of bistramide A (38), in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (9:1).\nScheme 5. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Bistramide A.\nRychnovsky and co-workers used a related strategy to construct the western tetrahydropyran fragment of marine cytotoxin leucascandrolide A (43).14 As shown in Scheme 6, the lactone 39 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 in high yield (91%) and high diastereoselectivity (15:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 with silyl enol ether 41 in the presence of catalytic zinc bromide led to formation of tetrahydropyran 42 in high yield (92%) and good diastereoselectivity (20:1). Tetrahydropyran 42 was then further elaborated to leucascandrolide A (43).\nScheme 6. Rychnovsky's Total Synthesis of Leuscandrolide A.\nThe most complex example of such intermolecular couplings comes from Crimmins and co-workers recent synthesis of the cancer cell growth inhibitor (+)-irciniastatin A (48).15 This convergent strategy is outlined in Scheme 7. Reduction of lactone 44 followed by trapping with Ac2O proceeds to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 in quantitative yield. Treatment of the sterically hindered \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 with boron trifluoride etherate followed by a slight excess of the highly functionalized silyl enol ether 46 gave tetrahydropyran 47 in good yield (59%; 85% based on recovered ketone) and high diastereoselectivity (>20:1). Tetrahydropyran 47 was then carried forward to afford (+)-irciniastatin A (48).\nScheme 7. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Irciniastatin A.\nReductive acetylation followed by intermolecular coupling has proven to be a useful strategy for coupling complex fragments in total synthesis.16 The success of this methodology is largely due to the functional group compatibility of the reduction and mild conditions for oxocarbenium ion formation. Furthermore, the coupling itself often proceeds in high yield and high diastereoselectivity. These features validate this method as a highly convergent process in complex natural product synthesis."

An argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system.

The organic layer is separated using a 500-mL separatory funnel and the aqueous solution is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 20 mL) (Note 7). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (10 g) (Note 8), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (from 760 mmHg to 26 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The residue is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and dried for 4 h under vacuum (10 mmHg). The crude compound 1 thus obtained is used directly in the next step without further purification (Note 9).\n2-(2-Bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanal (2). The previous 500-mL round-bottomed flask with the crude 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanenitrile (1) is equipped with an oval stirring bar (32 mm x 15 mm), argon inlet and a rubber septum. An argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system. The flask is charged through the septum (via syringe) with anhydrous CH2Cl2 (150 mL) (Note 10) and immersed in a previously cooled dry ice/acetone bath at -78 \u00baC (internal temperature) (Note 11). Then, DIBAL-H (45 mL, 45.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe over a 15 min period (Note 12), resulting in a pale orange solution. The reaction progress is followed by TLC analysis (Note 13) or GC analysis (Note 14). After 2 h reaction time, additional DIBAL-H (20.4 mL, 20.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe; after stirring for an additional 1 h, no more starting material is observed by TLC analysis (Note 15). The flask is removed from the cooled bath, and the reaction is then quenched by slow addition of ethyl acetate (150 mL) (Note 16) and 2M HCl (100 mL) (Note 17) over a 10 min period. The organic phase is separated using a 1-L separatory funnel and the aqueous solution is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate (8 g) and concentrated by rotary evaporation (from 760 mmHg to 26 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 18). The title compound is thus obtained as a yellow oil (8.00-8.09 g, 69-70% yield) (Note 19).",

            "The olefin metathesis reaction has emerged as a widely used transformation in organic chemistry and materials science.4 In keeping with the theme of our original article, this discussion addendum provides an overview of current large-scale ring-closing metathesis (RCM) applications of the Ru-based family of metathesis catalysts, the structures of which are shown in Figure 1.5\nFigure 1. Commonly Used Olefin Metathesis Catalysts.\nIn our 2003 report for the preparation of N-Boc-3-pyrroline , we utilized 0.5 mol% of catalyst 1 in a refluxing (2.5 h) 0.4 M solution of N-Boc-diallylamine in CH2Cl2. The report also described an extractive method for removing Ru-derived catalytic species/impurities using the water-soluble P(CH2OH)3, readily prepared from a commercially available fire-retardant aqueous formulation of P(CH2OH)4Cl. Following Kugelrohr distillation, this method reliably provided ca. 30 g of crystalline N-Boc-3-pyrroline in 90-94% isolated yield. Concurrent with the development of our procedure, Helmchen reported6 a 100 g preparation of Boc-3-pyrroline using 0.1 mol% of ethylidene 2a in a room-temperature (15 h) 0.57 M CH2Cl2 solution of N-Boc-diallylamine. Catalyst deactivation or removal procedures were not taken and the product was isolated in 98% yield after vacuum distillation. This transformation has also been reported to proceed in 87% yield when run neat and with catalyst 5 loading as low as 500 ppm.7\nSince the time of our report, however, RCM has rapidly matured and has been used to prepare kilogram quantities of structurally complex macrocyclic synthetic intermediates within the pharmaceutical industry. Optimizing a large-scale RCM process requires that several conditions be studied, namely, substrate type and functional group compatibility, catalyst selection, and solvent/temperature/time requirements. In many applications, removal of residual ruthenium is also a concern. In this Discussion Addendum, large-scale industrial RCM processes will be used to frame the relevant issues. These examples include Boehringer-Ingelheim's Hepatitis C protease inhibitor BILN-2061, GlaxoSmithKline's cathepsin \u039a inhibitor SB-462795, and RCM-tethered macrocyclic peptides. The discussion will conclude with an overview of developments in the area of ruthenium removal.\nFigure 2. SB-462795 and BILN-2061 and their RCM disconnections.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the 2006 and 2009 RCM processes for construction of the BILN-2061 peptide macrocycle.\nBoehringer-Ingelheim's 2006 disclosure8,9,10,11,12,13 of a large-scale RCM approach to the hepatitis C viral protease inhibitor BILN-2061 provides an interesting case study for those contemplating a large-scale metathesis process. The BILN-2061 metathesis substrate is an unnatural tripeptide-derived diene, which closes to a (Z)-olefin-containing 15-membered ring. Two of the conformation-restraining amide bonds are endocyclic, and two additional macrocyclic torsional degrees of freedom are fixed by the presence of the five-membered proline ring and an endocyclic trans-cyclopropane. The optimized 2006 RCM process (Figure 3) was scaled up to produce >400 kg of cyclized product.10 Three years later, the BI group reported a higher-yielding and order-of-magnitude greener procedure, one which dramatically reduced the amount of time, solvent, and catalyst loading.13\nThe first efforts to construct the BILN-2061 macrocycle used catalyst 1.9 These trials were met with problematic epimerization at the \u03b2-carbon of the vinylcyclopropyl amino acid residue (Figure 4). When a mono-phosphine catalyst such as 3 was used, the epimerization reaction was not observed. Analysis of model systems revealed that the rearrangement was facile when the bis-phosphine catalyst 1 was used. The rearrangement could also be promoted by adding one equivalent of phosphine to a mixture of catalyst 3 and the model system (Figure 4). The origin of this rearrangement was suggested to occur via the intermediacy of bis-phosphino or amino phosphino ruthenacyclopentene intermediates.9,11 Further studies revealed that the site of catalyst initiation in the macrocycle precursor depended upon the substitution of the aminocylopropylcarboxylic acid nitrogen atom: acyl-type substituents such as N-Boc shifted the initiation to the rearrangement-stable nonenoic residue (Figure 4).12 Before this detail was known, the reasonably efficient 2006 process using diene 7 and catalyst 3 was plagued by problematic batch inconsistencies. Traces of morpholine (<20 ppm) in the toluene solvent were shown to be responsible for substrate isomerization and catalyst inhibition, with the former arising from bis-ligated Ru species of the type discussed earlier. These problems were alleviated by acid-washing the solvent prior to the metathesis reaction.\nFigure 4. Catalyst-specific epimerization observed in RCM reactions of BILN-2061 substrates, suggested ruthenacyclopentene intermediates, and the effect of N-Boc substitution on site of catalyst initiation.\nThe aminocyclopropyl metathesis rearrangement encountered by the BI group was unexpected and highly substrate-specific. The most common side reactions in metathesis processes are alkene isomerization reactions.14 Because of the reversible nature of olefin metathesis, isomerization can alter unreacted starting material or products. It can be problematic in reactions where the catalyst is stressed by temperature or time or in some product purifications involving direct distillation from Ru-containing pot residues.15 For example, ring closure of diallyl ether 19 to 20 with catalyst 4 (Figure 5) is a rapid reaction, but significant product isomerization to vinyl ether 21 can occur at extended reaction times. Rearrangement is thought to arise from Ru-H species; it can be suppressed by solvent selection16,17 or by additives such as tricyclohexylphosphine oxide,18 acetic acid or 1,4-benzoquinones,19 phenylphosphoric acid,20 chlorocatechol borane,21 or Cy2BCl.22\nFigure 5. Select rearrangements observed in Ru-catalyzed metathesis reactions.\nRearrangement chemistry is the desired outcome in some applications. For example, Ru-catalyzed rearrangements are used for selective O-allyl23 and N-allyl24 deprotections. The latter, an allylamine to enamine transformation, was observed in lactam-piperidone 22 when treated with catalyst 1 in refluxing toluene (Figure 5). Olefin migration can also occur in hydrocarbon chains. For example, attempts to ring-close cyclopentanone-derived diene 25 with catalyst 4 did not return the [9.5.0] ring system.25 Instead, the monosubstituted double bond was found to migrate at a rate faster than 9- or 8-membered ring closure, leading to exclusive generation of the [7.5.0] product 26. Another strategy purposefully adds a hydride source to promote rearrangement after ring closure. For example, enol ether 28 is formed in 82% yield by first performing an RCM reaction on diene 27 to form the seven-membered ring product, which is then isomerized in a second step involving addition of NaBH4 to the Ru-containing reaction mixture.26\nNon-metathesis side reactions have also been reported in the context of Ru-promoted metathesis reactions. Hoye and Zhao have reported fragmentation reactions in RCM substrates containing secondary allylic alcohols; in sluggish metathesis reactions these systems can fragment to the methyl ketone.27 Kharasch additions of CHCl3 to olefins, as catalyzed by 1 at 65 \u00b0C, are also known.28\nAlthough the problem of isomerization was largely solved and the RCM reaction was utilized at kg scale, the 2006 BILN-2061 process suffered from several other drawbacks. The first of these was the dilute substrate concentration (0.014 M), which required excessive solvent consumption. A study of the macrocyclization behavior of different acyclic dienes and dimeric intermediates revealed a 27-fold improvement in the effective molarity (EM) of cyclization, which translated to a 0.2 M RCM process.12 A significant shortening of the reaction time was also realized. As mentioned earlier, an N-Boc group at the vinylcyclopropane amide residue was found to productively shift the site of catalyst initiation and led to a more facile and robust ring-closing reaction. While adding protection-deprotection steps, the improved 2009 process could therefore be run at higher concentrations and temperatures and with lower catalyst loadings (0.1 mol% 6 vs. 3 mol% 3). Each of these factors contributed in a positive manner to the EM of cyclization. Although the details will not be considered here, one of the principle steps in optimizing the BILN-2061 macrocyclization was defining conditions which (i) minimized formation of dimeric compounds arising from acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) processes,29,30 and (ii) one in which these oligomers could be equilibrated to product.\nThe BILN-2061 RCM reaction optimization is best viewed in terms of green chemistry considerations. The 2009 process13 represented a significant savings in terms of time, energy, and material. The RCM step was reduced to minutes instead of hours. Scrupulous degassing and solvent purification was necessary for the 2006 process, whereas the new process only required a brief degassing boil-out. The 2006 RCM process required as much as 150,000 L solvent per metric ton of diene, whereas the 2009 process reduced this amount to 7,500 L/MT. Because catalyst loading was greatly reduced in the 2009 process, Ru removal was likewise less resource-intensive. The 2006 process used excess 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (2 kg/1 kg diene) and aqueous bicarbonate to remove a portion of the soluble ruthenium, with subsequent silica gel and charcoal filtrations necessary to reduce Ru levels to 10 ppm in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In contrast, the 2009 process used 50-fold less 2-mercaptonicotinic acid and did not utilize silica or charcoal filtrations. The Sheldon E-factor,31 which is the ratio of waste mass to product mass, improved to 52 (computed for the 2009 Boc protection/RCM/Boc deprotection process) from 370 (computed for the 2006 RCM process).\nLarge-scale RCM was also used in GlaxoSmithKline's 2009 synthesis of the seven-membered azapane ring in cathepsin K inhibitor SB-462795 (Figure 6).32 The metathesis step in this synthesis also required multiple optimization attempts. Initial efforts using diene 29 and catalyst 5 were stymied by the need for high catalyst loadings (5-10 mol%). Substrate-catalyst coordination was suspected to be the source of the problem, but reactions using Ti(O-iPr)4 as a chelation inhibitor33,34 were not successful due to substrate/product decomposition. Additionally, large residual Ru levels were deemed a safety hazard with downstream steps involving H2O2 (for chiral auxiliary removal) and an acyl azide (for nitrogen insertion via Curtius rearrangement). To complicate matters, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone RCM product 30 decomposed via a retro-aldol reaction when the basic P(CH2OH)3/NaOH ruthenium removal procedure was employed. These setbacks led to the design of N/O-protected RCM precursor 31. This substrate closed with lower catalyst loadings (1-2 mol%) but gave capricious levels of olefin migration when attempted with crude product coming out of a Curtius rearrangement employing hydrazine and t-butyl nitrite/HCl (Figure 6). Solvent swaps or isomerization inhibitors (acetic acid, styrene, or Cy3PO) did not suppress the isomerization. The RCM process was made tractable by purifying precursor diene 31 as the HCl salt. When converted to the free base, it reliably provided 32 as a crystalline product in 90% yield using 1-2 mol% of catalyst 5. A basic cysteine wash was used to remove Ru; this thiol-based approach was utilized after it was discovered that (i) formaldehyde, generated during in situ generation of P(CH2OH)3, added to the carbamate nitrogen of product 32 to form hydroxymethylated 35, and (ii) residual P reagents proved problematic for subsequent olefin hydrogenation.\nFigure 6. Selected RCM reactions used in the synthesis of SB-462795.\nAn alternative route to SB-462795 employed RCM precursor 36 containing a phthalimide-protected trans-1,2-aminoalcohol moiety. In comparison with diene 31, this substrate offered a significant improvement in the RCM process, although here again significant optimization efforts were directed at identifying and minimizing trace impurity catalyst inhibitors.35 Highly purified material could be closed in quantitative yields with as little as 0.25-0.5 mol% catalyst 5. Olefin migration was not observed, even in reactions using crude material. When conducted in toluene, the product readily crystallized and provided material with low residual Ru content after the slurry was washed with P(CH2OH)3/NaHCO3.36 According to the published account, both approaches were amenable to large-scale manufacturing and the trans-1,2-aminoalcohol route was used to provide over 200 kg of SB-462795.\nOther publicly disclosed pharmaceutical applications of RCM involve its use to conformationally constrain37,38,39 and alter the metabolic profile of helical peptides by forming peptide macrocycles.40 Scale-up aspects of this chemistry remain proprietary, but much of the exploratory work has been on solid support,41 with microwave-assisted RCM macrocyclizations.42,43 Many examples undergo efficient RCM reactions, and in a solution-phase study of minimal RCM constraints in 310-helical peptides, it was found that high E-selectivity could be realized in an unoptimized 18-membered macrocyclization (38\u219239, Figure 7) catalyzed by 5-7 mol% 4 in refluxing dichloromethane.44\nFigure 7. Representative helical peptide macrocyclization and work-up procedures.\nThe reactions shown in Figure 7 highlight two additional methods for post-RCM reaction processing: (i) the use of ethyl vinyl ether as a Ru catalyst poison (by formation of the stable Fischer carbene) prior to evaporation and silica gel chromatography (SGC), and (ii) a Ru removal procedure utilizing the commercially available, albeit expensive, tris(hydroxymethyl)-phosphine.15,45\nThe BI and GSK investigations show that large-scale RCM reactions can require significant optimization. It is expected that these paths will shorten as more applications are reported. These two examples reveal that at-scale process applications can utilize as little as 0.1-0.5 mol % Ru catalyst, which minimizes the waste stream and is in accord with sustainable green chemistry practice. Sustainable concepts in olefin metathesis have been reviewed elsewhere.46 Pharmaceutical applications require that the API contain <10 ppm metal, and the two industrial examples discussed here utilized water-solubilizing procedures using 2-mercaptonicotinic acid,13 cysteine,32 or tris(hydroxy-methyl)phosphine.36 Downstream processes such as hydrogenation over charcoal-based catalysts can also be used to reduce Ru levels to <1 ppm.35 Other approaches to remove Ru include amine-functionalized mesoporous silicates,47 polar isocyanides,48 lead tetraacetate,49 activated carbon/silica gel,50 and DMSO or triphenylphosphine oxide treatment of crude reaction mixtures.51 DMSO/DMF mixtures have been used to remove colored Ru impurities in solid-phase RCM applications.52 A recent report describes the use of 15% aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an efficient Ru removal agent; this process also oxidizes residual phosphine and carbene ligands to more polar entities, thus easing purification in some cases.53"

Upon completion of the addition, the flask is fully submersed in the dry ice bath to bring the internal temperature to -70 \u00b0C. The viscous reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at this temperature for 1.5 h. On occasion, the stir bar stops stirring in the thick slurry and is dislodged using the thermometer. During this time, a flame-dried, 500-mL pear-shaped flask is charged with iodine (25.4 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5).

The resulting suspension is stirred for 2.5 h, after which time it is sparged with argon for 15 min (Note 15).\nA separate flame-dried, 1-L, 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm) and two rubber septa is charged through the open neck with vinyl iodide 5 (6.25 g, 26.3 mmol, 1.2 equiv), cesium carbonate (7.14 g, 21.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and triphenylarsine (0.67 g, 2.2 mmol, 0.10 equiv) (Note 14). A third septum is added, the flask is evacuated (> 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and DMF (130 mL) (Note 14) is added via a 20-mL plastic syringe.

The resulting degassed suspension is then treated with the aforementioned hydroboration mixture via cannula over 10 min (Note 16). Upon completion of the cannula transfer, the reaction vessel is evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and the dark brown reaction mixture is stirred for 5 h before it is poured onto 500 mL saturated NaCl in a 2 L separatory funnel. The organic phase is isolated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 x 300 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate (40 g), and the drying agent is removed via vacuum filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel (150 mmHg). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to give the product as a dark oil containing some residual DMF. Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel (Note 17) gives 7.12 g (88%) (Note 18) of acetonide 6 as a brown oil containing 7% (w/w) cyclooctanone (Note 19).",

            "Several methods are available for the direct formylation of phenols, but most of them suffer from lack of regioselectivity. Moreover, several of the methods involve the use of noxious reagents and harsh reaction conditions resulting in moderate to good yields of aldehydes.3 An exception is the formylation of phenols using the acceptable reagents MgCl2, Et3N and paraformaldehyde giving high yields of salicylaldehydes from reactions exclusively at the ortho-position.4 Additional examples and applications of this method since its appearance in 1999 are presented here. We have emphasized the scope of the reaction and its participation in one-pot preparations.\nScope of the ortho-Formylation Reaction\nNumerous applications of the formylation reaction have been reported in the past twelve years. A number of substituted phenols have been successfully formylated (Figure 1). Alkyl and alkoxy substituents promote the formylation, with high to excellent yields of salicylaldehydes being obtained (Figure 1).4,5 Highly substituted phenols undergo the reaction; for example, reaction of the phenol 1 furnished the salicylaldehyde 2 in 62% yield.6Surprisingly, however, \u03b1,\u03c9\u2013bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes were unreactive towards the method.7\nFigure 1. Ortho-formylation of phenols using MgCl2, Et3N and para-formaldehyde.\nThe method has been used for the formylation of estrogens.8,9 The reactions occurred to provide excellent yields of regioisomeric aldehydes, with high preference for the 2-isomer (Table 1, Figure 2).\nTable 1. Results from ortho-formylation of estrogens.\nR1 R2 R3 Regioisomeric ratio of 2- and 4-isomers Yield%\nOH H H 13:1 92\nOH CCH H 6:1 86\nOH CH2CH3 H 12:1 90\nH OH H 13:1 85\nOAc H H 8:1 90\nOH H OH not determined 15\n=O H 9:1 90\nOCH2CH2O H 12:1 74\nThe practical use of this method was demonstrated with the synthesis of the anti-cancer agent 2-methoxyestradiol (3) from estradiol in 36% overall yield (Figure 2).9\nFigure 2. orthoo-Formylation of estrogens.\nAromatic substituents have no detrimental effect on the reaction. Phenyl-,10 perfluorophenyl-11 and 2-nitrophenyl-substituted11 phenols were formylated in good yields, and the same was the case with mono-protected 2,2\u00b4-bisphenol.12 Naphthol derivatives behave similarly giving ortho-formylation products,13,14 and of special merit is the preparation of 3-formyloctahydro-1,1\u00b4-binaphthol.14b 5-Methoxy-2-naphthol was formylated in 75% yield as part of the total synthesis of racemic juglomycin A.15\nOxygen functions are well tolerated; several mono protected resorcinols and methylenedioxy- substituted -phenols have been formylated in excellent yields and high regioselectivity.16,17 Moreover, several methylthio- and phenylthiophenol derivatives have been formylated in high yields.18 Halogen-substituted phenols are good substrates in the reaction,4 and this has been thoroughly substantiated in the last decade.19\nFigure 3. Ortho-formylation of mono-protected resorcinols.\nThe method also tolerates electron attracting groups like cyano and ester, but the reaction proceeds at a slower rate when these groups are attached to the benzene ring, and more byproducts may appear as well.4 As anticipated, faster reactions were encountered when the ester group was further removed from the benzene ring. Formylation of 4 gave 5 in 94% yield20 and reaction of the phenol 6 furnished aldehyde 7 in high yield (Figure 4).21 The presence of two ester groups was accepted; formylation of dimethyl 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)succinate proceeded with excellent yield.22 Moreover, protected tyrosine, viz. methyl N-Cbz-tyrosinate was successfully formylated in 43% yield.23 Since the formylation of 4-cyanophenol was successful,4,24 it is interesting to note that (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetonitrile could not be formylated by the different methods tried.25\nFigure 4. Examples of ortho-formylations.\nThe Formylation Method as Part of One-pot Reactions\nMuch can be gained with respect to efficiency and yields by using multi-component one-pot reactions, since several reactions can be carried out successively without isolation of intermediates. The reagents of this method appeared compatible for such a set-up, and several applications have been reported.\nThe catechol structural entity is present in natural products, many of biological interest. A one-pot preparation of catechols from the corresponding phenols has been reported26 involving the formylation reaction followed by Dakin or Baeyer-Villliger oxidations. The yields are very good (Figure 5). The method has been used in the synthesis of combretastatins A-1 and B-1.27\nFigure 5. One-pot synthesis of catechols.\nSalen ligands, that form part of the Jacobsen catalyst, were prepared in excellent yields by a one-pot reaction starting from the appropriate phenol (Figure 6).28 The yields are considerably better than those previously obtained by a two-step protocol.\nFigure 6. One-pot synthesis of salens.\nBy another one-pot reaction, salicylamines were prepared in good yields by reductive amination of the corresponding salicylaldehydes as outlined in Figure 7. The amines were further manipulated without isolation of intermediates to dihydro-2 H-1,3-benzoxazines in good overall yields, considering the four reactions involved.29 In a related one-pot procedure salicylnitriles were prepared.30 In this case the imines formed from the respective salicylaldehyde and ammonia were oxidized with o-iodoxybenzoic acid to give good yields of the corresponding nitriles.\nFigure 7. One-pot synthesis of salicylamines and dihydro-2H-1,3-benzoxazines.\nCinnamic acid derivatives are useful for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Converting phenols to salicylaldehydes and subsequent treatment with methyl (triphenylphosporanylidene)acetate in a one-pot reaction afforded methyl 2-hydroxycinnamate derivatives in acceptable yields (Figure 8).31\nFigure 8. One-pot synthesis of methyl cinnamates.\nConclusion\nThe results have demonstrated that the method described above fits well into the assembly of phenol formylation reactions. It may prove to be the method of choice in many cases because of the ease of execution, regioselectivity, and good yields."

The reaction mixture is diluted with a mixture of water and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (1:1, 400 mL) and the aqueous and organic layers are separated in a 2-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is further extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (550 mL) and brine (550 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (110 g), filtered and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (200 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The brown residue is then dissolved in a mixture of hexanes-ethyl acetate (6:1, 100 mL) and CH2Cl2 (40 mL), loaded on a short pad of silica gel (Note 9) (70 g, 9 \u00d7 5 cm) and flushed with hexanes-ethyl acetate (6:1, 400 mL). The resulting yellow solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (200 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C), and transferred to a 250-mL flask, and equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The residue is dried in vacuo (6.5 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C, 30 min) and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser. The orange solid is dissolved in a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (1:1, 42 mL, 70 \u00b0C, oil bath, external temperature), the stir bar is removed and the sealed flask is allowed to cool to -20 \u00b0C in a freezer for 16 h to allow crystallization of the desired product. The solvent is decanted and the yellow crystals are washed with hexanes-ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 15 mL, 0 \u00b0C) and dried in vacuo (6.5 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C, 24 h) to afford carbonate 4 (Note 10) (14.7-15.2 g, 48.0-49.7 mmol, 55-57% yield) (Note 11).",

Anhydrous THF (Note 6) (50 mL) is added via cannula and the resulting suspension is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (ice-water bath, internal temperature). The cold solution of IPNBSH is transferred to the suspension of potassium hydride via cannula over 15 min at 0 \u00b0C under an argon atmosphere, resulting in formation of a beige precipitate. The IPNBSH source flask is rinsed with anhydrous THF (Note 6) (25 mL, 0 \u00b0C) to complete the transfer to the reaction mixture.

            "Brook rearrangement-mediated [3 + 4] annulation has evolved as a unique methodology for the construction of not only seven-membered carbocycles but also eight-membered carbo- and oxygen-heterocycles and has been applied to the synthesis of natural products after clarification2 of the precise reaction mechanism accounting for the stereospecificity.\nSynthesis of the Tricyclic Skeleton of Allocyathin B2\nThe synthetic utility of annulation was first demonstrated by the synthesis of the unusual 5-6-7 tricyclic ring skeleton of allocyathin B2, a compound that has been shown to have potent nerve growth factor synthesis-stimulating activity and to be a \u03ba opioid receptor agonist (Scheme 1). The key [3 + 4] annulation proceeded smoothly even with a relatively complex four-carbon unit 1 to afford 2 as a single diastereomer in 50% yield, which was transformed to 3.3\nScheme 1 Synthesis of the tricyclic skeleton of allocyathin B2.\nConstruction of a Tricyclo[5.3.0.01,4]decenone Ring System\nThe use of acryloylsilanes 4 with a leaving group such as a halogen atom at the \u03b2-position as a three-carbon unit in the [3 + 4] annulation afforded tricyclic ketone derivatives 7a,b in yields dependent upon the \u03b2-substituent of 4, in addition to the [3 + 4] annulation-debromosilylation products 9a,b (Scheme 2).4 Small structural changes in the four-carbon unit significantly affect the product distribution. Thus, whereas cyclopentyl methyl ketone enolate gave 7a in almost all cases, 9b was formed as a byproduct in the case of the corresponding cyclohexyl derivative. Mechanistic studies including low-temperature quenching experiments suggested that 7a,b can be formed via an SN'-like intramolecular attack of the enolate at the C-4 position in the intermediate 6a,b, and 9a,b can be formed via tricyclic intermediate 8a,b.\nScheme 2 Construction of a tricyclo[5.3.0.01,4]decenone ring system.\nBF3\u00b7Et2O-Mediated Intramolecular Allylstannane-Ketone Cyclizations\n[3 + 4] annulation using a combination of (Z)-(\u03b2-(tributylstannnyl)acryloyl)silanes 10 and alkenyl methyl ketone enolate 11 proceeded in the same manner to give cycloheptenone derivative 12, which upon treatment with BF3\u00b7Et2O, afforded bicyclo[4.1.0]heptenols 13, an intramolecular addition product of the allylstannane system to the carbonyl group (Scheme 3).5\nScheme 3 BF3\u00b7Et2O-Mediated intramolecular allylstannane-ketone cyclizations.\nStereoselective Construction of Eight-Membered Carbocycles and Oxygen-Heterocycles\nThe use of the enolate 15 (X = CH2) derived from 2-cycloheptenone as the four-carbon unit in [3 + 4] annulation instead of the enolates of alkenyl methyl ketones produced bicyclo[3.3.2]decenone derivatives 16.The two-atom internal tether in these products could be oxidatively cleaved after conversion to \u03b1-hydroxy ketone 17 to give the cis-3,4,8-trisubstituted cyclooctenone enol silyl ethers 18 stereoselectively (Scheme 4).6 This methodology has also been successfully applied to the construction of oxygen eight-membered heterocycles using enolates of 6-oxacyclohept-2-en-1-one 15 (X = O), affording eight-membered oxygen heterocycles 18 (X = O) possessing functionality that can easily be manipulated to generate other functionalized eight-membered ring products.7\nScheme 4 Stereoselective construction of eight-membered carbocycles and oxygen-heterocycles.\nFormal Total Syntheses of (+)-Prelaureatin and (+)-Laurallene\nThe versatility of the annulation has been highlighted through the formal total synthesis of (+)-prelaureatin, a biogenetic precursor of several members of the laurenan structural subclass (Scheme 5).8 The annulation of 19 and sodium enolate 20 proceeded in a highly diastereoselective manner to afford exclusively 21 in 80% yield. The observed excellent selectivity could be explained in terms of the approach of the acryloylsilane from the same side as the C-7 substituent in 20 that is sterically less hindered because of pseudo equatorial disposition of the substituent on the seven-membered ring. The bicyclic derivative 21 was transformed into Crimmins' intermediate 229 after oxidative cleavage of the two-carbon tether.\nScheme 5 Formal total syntheses of (+)-prelaureatin.\nStereocontrolled Construction of Seven- and Eight-Membered Carbocycles Using a Combination of Brook Rearrangement-Mediated [3 + 4] Annulation and Epoxysilane Rearrangement\nThe [3 + 4] annulation has also been expanded to include the construction of densely functionalized seven- and eight-membered carbocycles by combining it with an epoxysilane rearrangement,10 which features a further extension of a stereocontrolled anion relay.11 Reactions of \u03b4-silyl-\u03b3,\u03b4-epoxy-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acylsilane 23 with alkenyl methyl ketone enolate 24 afforded highly functionalized cycloheptenone derivative 28 via a tandem process that involves Brook rearrangement followed by the resulting carbanion-induced ring-opening of the epoxide (25 \u2192 26), a second Brook rearrangement, the formation of divinylcyclopropanediolate derivative 27 via internal carbonyl attack by the resulting carbanion, and an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement (Scheme 6). The reactions using an alternative combination of three and four carbon units (29 + 30), in which an epoxysilane moiety was incorporated in the four-carbon unit, also give satisfactory results, via 1,4-O-to-O silyl migration (31 \u2192 32). Use of enantioenriched acylsilane 33 and 2-cycloheptenone enolate 34 gave a moderate level (62% ee) of asymmetric induction in the bicyclic ketone 35.\nScheme 6 Stereocontrolled construction of seven- and eight-membered carbocycles using a combination of Brook rearrangement-mediated [3 + 4] annulation and epoxysilane rearrangement."

The flask is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa (Note 2). To the stirred slurry is added trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL, 13 mmol, 0.2 equiv) and 1,2-dibromoethane (1 mL, 12 mmol, 0.2 equiv). The stirred mixture (Note 3) is heated with a heating mantle to 50-55\u00b0C, held at this temperature for 5 min (Note 4), and then cooled to 25-30\u00b0C using a 20 \u00b0C water bath. Maintaining water bath cooling, 4-bromoanisole (33 g, 0.18 mol, 3 equiv) (Note 5) and cobalt bromide (4.0 g, 18 mmol, 0.3 equiv) (Note 6) are added sequentially.

            "2,4-Dichloroquinoline (1). A 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask was equipped with a teflon-coated, oval-shaped stir bar (41 \u00d7 17 mm) and charged with malonic acid (26.0 g, 250 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 1)).2 A rubber septum was connected to one of the side necks and a condenser is attached to the middle neck. That condenser was equipped with a line that runs to an HCl trap ((Note 2)). The flask was lowered into an ice water bath and POCl3 (100 mL) was poured into the open neck. The open neck was sealed with a rubber septum. A slight flow of nitrogen gas was introduced into the system through a needle (16 gauge) inserted into one of the side neck septa (Note 3). Stirring was initiated at 300 rpm. Aniline (22.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) was added slowly to the stirring mixture by syringe through a side neck septum over a period of 20 min (Note 4). The flask was then removed from the ice water bath, allowed to stir for 10 min, placed into an oil bath (~110 \u00b0C). and the mixture was stirred for 6 h (Note 5). The flask was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool for 5 min without stirring (Note 6). The mixture was slowly and carefully poured onto crushed ice (~ 1 L) in a 2 L beaker while intermittently stirring with a spatula. The residual material in the 3-neck round-bottomed flask was removed by carefully adding water (100 mL) to the flask and scraping out with a spatula. The aqueous mixture was triturated by vigorous stirring with the spatula (Note 7). The 2 L quench beaker was placed into a bucket of ice. Aqueous NaOH (6 M, 475 mL) was added slowly (over a period of 25 min, maintaining the temperature \u2264 50 \u00b0C) while intermittently stirring (Note 8). The beaker was removed from the ice bath and the suspension was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and age with stirring (77 \u00d7 13 mm stir bar, ~100 rpm) for 12 h (Note 9). The pH of the supernatant was ~7. The suspension was then vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (12.5 cm diameter). Water (150 mL) was used to rinse the residual material from the beaker. The filtered orange-red solid was rinsed with water (150 mL) on the filter. After thoroughly air-drying on the filter (> 1 h), the solid was transferred into 2 cellulose thimbles (43 mm \u00d7 123 mm, int. diam. x ext. length). The contents of each thimble were subjected to a Soxhlet extraction with hexaness (300 mL, (Note 10)) for 16 h. The combined extracts were concentrated (Note 10) by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to leave a yellow solid (13.9\u201314.6 g, 28\u201329%, Notes (Note 11) and (Note 12)) that was used in step B without further purification (Note 13).",
            "H,4ClQuin-BAM (2). A 100 mL, round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a teflon-coated oval stir bar (32 \u00d7 15 mm), rubber septum and an inlet needle connected to an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 16) was first charged with (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1.63 g, 14.3 mmol, 1 equiv, Notes (Note 17) and (Note 18)). Then, Pd(dba)2 (164 mg, 285 \u03bcmol, 0.02 equiv), rac-BINAP (356 mg, 572 \u03bcmol, 0.04 equiv), 2,4-dichloroquinoline (1) (5.66 g, 28.6 mmol, 2 equiv) and sodium tert-butoxide (4.12 g, 42.9 mmol, 3 equiv, (Note 19)) were added. The reaction vessel was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times, then left under a positive pressure of argon.3 Toluene (35 mL) was dispensed into the flask, and the resulting red-brown solution was placed into an oil bath heated to 80 \u00b0C with stirring (Notes (Note 20) and (Note 21), Caution: possible exotherm!). The reaction was monitored by TLC (Note 22); after 1.5 h, nearly complete conversion was observed. The reaction was cooled to 25 \u00b0C, and saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added to the flask. The suspension was stirred for 5 min and cooled to 0 \u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (9 cm diameter) and washed with water (50 mL) and hexaness (150 mL) to afford a light yellow solid. This crude solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 100 mL round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 joint and dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for at least 10 h to leave 4.57-4.80 g of a light beige-yellow solid (73-77%) (Note 23), which was used in step C without further purification.",
            "H,4PyrrolidineQuin-BAM (PBAM) (3). A 10-20 mL microwave vial equipped with an oval stir bar (12 \u00d7 8 mm) was charged with H,4ClQuin-BAM (2) (4.30 g, 9.83 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 24)), pyrrolidine (3.23 mL, 39.3 mmol, 4 equiv) and trifluorotoluene (3.3 mL) (Note 25). The vial was sealed, and this suspension was heated with stirring in the microwave at 170 \u00b0C for 3 min, then at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27), Caution: exothermic!). The reaction mixture was diluted and transferred with 20 mL of dichloromethane to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask for evaporation (Note 28). The reaction was then concentrated by rotary evaporation (80 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg), redissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel, and washed with aqueous NaOH (3 M, 50 mL) and water (4 \u00d7 50 mL). The resulting organic layer was dispensed into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried (MgSO4, 2 g). The solution was filtered (flask and filter were rinsed with an extra 25 mL of dichloromethane) into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h) to provide a light brown powder (Note 29).\nAs much of the material as possible was transferred as a solid from the round-bottomed flask to a pre-weighed 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The remaining solid was dissolved and transferred into a 25-mL pear-shaped flask with 10 mL of dichloromethane and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h). This material was then added to the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The material was dissolved in a 90:10 mixture of acetone and toluene (20 mL/g crude product) with heating in a water bath (70 \u00b0C) (Note 30). The solution was removed from heat and placed on the bench for 1 hour to cool to room temperature. The flask was placed in an ice bath for 3 h or until no further crystallization was observed. The mother liquor was carefully decanted, leaving crystals that were washed with ice-cold acetone (2 \u00d7 10 mL). Residual solvent was removed from the crystals by placing the flask under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for a period of 5-10 min (Note 31). The crystalline material was transferred to a pre-weighed 20 mL glass scintillation vial and dried for ~14 h in a drying pistol (0.21 mmHg) over refluxing toluene. The vial was temporarily removed from the drying pistol, and the material was thoroughly pulverized with a spatula and returned to the drying pistol for an 6 additional 6 h. The dried material was a white cream colored powder (3.08-3.54 g, 62-71% yield) (Notes (Note 32) and (Note 33))."

The flask is connected to a solvent purification system, evacuated, charged with 200 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) (Note 2), refilled with nitrogen, and sealed with a rubber septum. A needle inlet with a positive pressure of nitrogen is inserted into the septum. (E)-2-Penten-1-ol (8.55 mL, 7.24 g, 84.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added in one portion via syringe with stirring (Note 3). The resulting clear solution is then cooled to approximately 0 \u00b0C by an ice-water bath for 20 min. p-Toluenesulfonyl isocyanate (15.3 mL, 100.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is added dropwise over 15 min through the septum via syringe (Note 4). Upon complete addition, the ice-bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature (23 \u00b0C). After 30 min, TLC analysis shows complete consumption of the starting material (Note 5). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separating funnel and washed with 400 mL of saturated aqueous NH4Cl (Note 6). After the layers are separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with DCM (2 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic phase is stored in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask and dried with 30 g of Na2SO4 for 30 min (Note 7). The solution is then filtered through a cotton plug into a 1-L recovery flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) to give the crude product as a colorless oil. The crude oil is dissolved in ~15 mL of DCM and loaded onto a chromatography column (5 \u00d7 17 cm, 120 g silica) (Note 8). After loading, the column is flushed with 400 mL of hexanes. Fraction collecting is started as 1 L of Hex:EtOAc:DCM (100:20:5) is added (flow rate: 20 mL/min, 25 mL fractions) (Note 9 and 10).

Diisopropylethylamine (H\u00fcnig's base) (2.25 mL, 1.60 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is then added and the clear solution is allowed to stir for 5 min. Water (66 mL) is added with vigorous stirring, resulting in a biphasic, milky solution (Notes 16 and 17). After stirring for 5 min, gold (I) chloride (AuCl) (150 mg, 0.645 mmol, 0.05 equiv) is added in portions over one minute (Note 18). Upon the addition of AuCl, the milky solution acquires a yellow tint (Note 19). Silver (I) triflate (AgOTf) (166 mg, 0.645 mmol, 0.05 equiv) is then added in one portion resulting in a much whiter solution (Note 20). A reflux condenser (30 \u00d7 3 cm) with a steady cold water flow is affixed, and the flask is then placed into a pre-heated oil bath (85 \u00b0C, bath temp.). The apparatus is then covered up with aluminum foil to minimize the exposure to light. After 1 h, the reaction progressively becomes clearer until the white color dissipates to leave a transparent/grayish solution with some black precipitate. Monitoring by 1H NMR shows the reaction to be nearly complete at 3 h (Note 21). After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture is diluted with 75 mL of DCM, and 75 mL of brine. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with DCM (2 \u00d7 75 mL).

White crystals precipitate on cooling to 0 \u00b0C for 15 min and are collected by B\u00fcchner funnel (diameter 90 mm) with a medium porosity fritted disk using suction filtration. The precipitate is washed with ice-cooled n-hexane (50 mL) and dried under vacuum (25 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg, 2 h) to give the first crop of O-TBS-N-tosylhydroxylamine (2) (16.4 g, 54.4 mmol, 69%). A second crop of crystals (1.24 g, 4.1 mmol, 5%) is obtained by dissolving the concentrated pale-yellow mother liquor in hot n-hexane (30 mL) and cooling in an ice bath for 30 min, followed by the filtration using 10 mL of ice-cooled n-hexane (Note 9).",

            "3-Bromocyclobutanone. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground glass joint is equipped with a 6-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (Note 1) and charged with 3-oxocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (20 g, 175 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2). Dichloromethane is added (250 mL, 0.7 M) (Note 3) to dissolve the acid at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). While stirring gently at 150 rpm, anhydrous magnesium sulfate (21.1 g, 175 mmol, 1 equiv) is added to the reaction, followed carefully by red mercury oxide (56.9 g, 263 mmol, 1.5 equiv). A reflux condenser is assembled (Note 4) and capped with a 24/40 rubber septum, through which the reaction is maintained under argon atmosphere (Note 5). The heterogeneous mixture is then stirred at 250-300 rpm and brought to vigorous reflux (oil bath temperature 46 \u00b0C) for 5 to 10 min to ensure freely flowing solids (Note 6).\nSeparately, neat bromine (13.5 mL, 263 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is taken up in a glass-syringe with a needle approximately as long as the reflux condenser (12 inches). The needle is threaded through the rubber septum at the top of the reflux condenser such that bromine will be released near or at the bottom of the condenser (Note 7). Bromine is carefully added dropwise over about 30 min to control the release of CO2 (g). (Figure 1) Three disposable 18-gauge needles are inserted into the septum to vent the reaction for the duration of bromine addition, and can be adjusted as needed.\nFigure 1. Reaction Set-up for Step A\nThe reaction color gradually fades from bright orange to pale orange-yellow. After 3 h the reaction progress is checked by TLC (Note 8). As TLC indicates incomplete conversion, additional bromine (7 mL, 136 mmol, 0.775 equiv) is added via syringe and the reaction is continued for a total of 6 h. After completion the reaction is cooled to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) and filtered through a pad of celite and silica gel (Note 9) with the aid of additional methylene chloride (250 mL). The clear, colorless filtrate is placed in a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined milky aqueous washes are back-extracted with methylene chloride (200 mL) (Note 10). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (200 mL) and then brine (200 mL). The solution is dried over approximately 5 g of magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 100 to 30 mmHg) to give crude bromide 1 as a clear pale yellow liquid (23.6 g, 90% yield) (Notes (Note 11), (Note 12), and (Note 13)).",
            "Cyclobutenone. A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 5-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (Note 1) is charged with tri-n-butylamine (54.5 mL, 228 mmol, 2 equiv) (Notes (Note 2) and (Note 14)) at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). Neat 3-bromocyclobutenone 1 is added to the amine dropwise over 30 min (17.0 g, 114 mmol, 1 equiv) and settles into a lower layer. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature, and can be stirred for 2 h without adverse effect. No precautions are taken to exclude light or monitor reaction progress by TLC.\nA 100-mL, single-necked, pear-bottomed flask is connected to the reaction flask via a short path distillation head with Vigreux indents (Notes (Note 1) and (Note 15)). This receiving flask is cooled to -78 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, and the reaction flask is placed in an oil bath held constant at 25 \u00b0C. (Figure 2) As the reaction flask is vigorously stirred at 250 rpm, pressure is carefully reduced to 2.5 mmHg and held for 20 min to ensure that cyclobutenone 2 does not foam over too rapidly (Note 16). At this time the receiving flask contains semi-frozen cyclobutenone, which rapidly melts to a clear and faint yellow liquid upon moving the receiving flask to ambient temperature (4.5-4.7 g, 58-60% yield) (Note 17). In this preparation, crude melted cyclobutenone 2 is dissolved in deuterated chloroform for use as a 1M solution (Notes (Note 18) and (Note 19)). If desired, the cyclobutenone 2 can be briefly stored neat at -78 \u00b0C, while the product purity is quickly checked by 1H NMR (Notes (Note 20), (Note 21), and (Note 22)).\nFigure 2.

A 500-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask with 24/40 joints (Note 1) is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (Teflon blade, 19 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 3 mm), a nitrogen inlet, and a temperature probe (Note 2). The nitrogen inlet is removed from the 500-mL flask. Methyl 4-cyanobenzoate (50.0 g, 310 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 3), acetic acid (50.0 mL) (Note 4), and tert-butyl acetate (83.2 mL, 72.0 g, 621 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 5) are charged to the 500-mL flask, and the nitrogen inlet is reinserted to the open neck. Stirring is initiated at a rate of 300 to 350 rpm. A temperature decrease is observed on mixing, and the slurry is allowed to warm to \u2265 19 \u00b0C (Note 6). Meanwhile, a 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask with 19/22 joints is immersed in an ambient temperature water bath (Dewar flask, 15-25 \u00b0C), 25 mm egg-shaped magnetic stir bar, temperature probe and N2 inlet. To the 250 mL flask, acetic acid (50 mL) is charged and a rubber septum is added to the third neck. Concentrated sulfuric acid (29.8 mL, 558 mmol, 1.8 equiv) (Note 7) is charged to the 250-mL flask in 3 mL portions by syringe, maintaining the internal temperature \u2264 40 \u00b0C (Note 8). The solution is allowed to cool and once the internal temperature reaches \u2264 25 \u00b0C, it is transferred from the 250-mL flask to a 120-mL addition funnel. The N2 line is removed from the joint of the 500-mL flask, the addition funnel is attached to the joint, and the N2 inlet adapter is placed on top of the addition funnel. An ambient temperature water bath (Dewar flask, 15-25 \u00b0C) is fitted around the 500-mL flask. The solution is charged over 1 h, maintaining an internal temperature \u2264 30 \u00b0C (Note 9). The reaction is analyzed for completion after 2 h (Note 10). A 1000-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask with 24/40 joints is immersed in an ambient temperature water bath (Dewar flask. 15-25 \u00b0C), is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (Teflon blade, 19 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 3 mm) and a thermocouple probe, and is charged with ammonium acetate (96.0 g, 124 mmol, 4 equiv) (Note 11) and water (250 mL) (Note 12). The ammonium acetate dissolves completely (Note 13). The reaction solution (slightly yellow, homogeneous, and viscous) is transferred from the 500-mL flask to a 250-mL addition funnel (Note 14). The addition funnel is attached to the 1000-mL flask and a N2 line is attached to the top joint via an inlet adapter (24/40 joint).

White solids begin to form immediately and the turbidity increases as the addition proceeds. The slurry is stirred for 17-24 h at room temperature (Notes (Note 15) and (Note 16)) and then filtered on a glass B\u00fcchner funnel (650 mL) (Note 17). The product is washed with water (2 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 18) and dried on the filter for 2 h. The product is then dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) in a 40 \u00b0C oil bath over two nights (Note 19) to yield 69.0 g (95%) of the amide at a purity of > 99.0 % (Note 20).

An oven-dried, 1-L, 3-necked round-bottomed flask containing a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter and two rubber septa, one of which is pierced with a thermocouple probe (Note 1). The flask is charged with a 50 wt % solution of ethoxyacetylene in hexanes (22 mL, 16.8 g, 0.12 mol, 1.8 equiv) (Note 2) and THF (70 mL), then cooled to 2 \u00b0C in an ice-bath. With stirring, 2M borane dimethyl sulfide complex in THF (17.5 mL, 35 mmol, 0.5 equiv) is added dropwise via a 30 mL syringe over 30 min, keeping the temperature below 7 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h at 2 \u00b0C (Note 3), then the ice-bath is replaced with a heating mantle. The nitrogen adapter is replaced with a vacuum-distillation head connected to a 500-mL round bottom flask immersed in a dry-ice bath. The volatile materials are removed at reduced pressure (60 mmHg) by applying gentle heating to the reaction flask (Note 4). After removal of volatile materials, the reaction flask is back-filled with nitrogen and the brown oil is dissolved by addition of toluene (65 mL) (Note 5). The stirred solution is cooled to -75 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath and 1.1M diethylzinc in toluene (96 mL, 105 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 6) is added by cannula over 10 min, keeping the temperature below -65 \u00b0C. After the solution is stirred for 30 min between -70 and -75 \u00b0C, hydrocinnamaldehyde (9.1 g, 68 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 7) is added dropwise via a 20 mL syringe over 2 min. The mixture is allowed to warm to 20 \u00b0C over 1 h and stirred for 3 h (Note 8). The reaction is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C in an ice-bath and t-butyl methyl ether (100 mL) is added. The nitrogen gas adapter is replaced with a 300-mL addition funnel. Vigorous stirring of the reaction mixture is commenced and water (100 mL) is carefully added over 5 min, keeping the temperature below 20 \u00b0C. Gas (ethane) is evolved and a white precipitate of zinc oxide is formed. The ice bath is removed and aqueous 2M HCl (200 mL) is added over 5 min via the addition funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min until the white precipitate of zinc oxide dissolves (Note 9). The quenched reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and back-extracted with MTBE (100 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (200 mL) and brine (50 mL), then dried by filtration through 50 g sodium sulfate. The volatile materials are removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 60 mmHg) to afford 12 g of a brown oil. The crude product is purified by flash column chromatography (Note 10) and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 60 mmHg) to afford 7.7-8.2 g (71-75 % yield) as a pale yellow oil (Notes (Note 11) and (Note 12))."

Using a large plastic funnel, the flask is charged with solid tert-butylhydrazine hydrochloride (25.00 g, 98%, 196.6 mmol) (Note 1) and 2 M NaOH (98.3 mL, 2 M, 196.6 mmol) (Note 2) is added. Stirring is started at ambient temperature. When a complete solution has formed (approx. 10 min), 3-aminocrotononitrile (16.82 g, 96%, 196.6 mmol) (Note 3) is added through the funnel, and the stirring is continued. The funnel is replaced with a thermocouple (Note 4), an air-cooled reflux condenser is fixed to the flask, the third joint is sealed with a glass stopper, and the top of the condenser is connected to an ambient pressure nitrogen line (Note 5). The slurry is then heated to 90 \u00b0C (internal reaction temperature) with vigorous stirring for 22 h. After 22 h, the yellow/orange biphasic mixture is cooled to 57 \u00b0C, the glass stopper removed, and a ~2 mL aliquot of the well-stirred biphasic mixture is removed with a pipette and placed in a 10-mL round-bottomed flask containing a small stir bar (1/2\" \u00d7 1/8\"). The 10 mL flask is then immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath for several minutes until completely frozen. The 10-mL flask is then removed from the bath and allowed to warm up slowly over a magnetic stirplate with the stirring on. As the mass melts, a slurry of seed crystals is formed (Note 6). With the bulk of the reaction being held and stirred vigorously at 57 \u00b0C, the seed slurry is introduced by pouring it through the empty joint into the 250-mL flask in a single portion. Crystallization is evidenced by the formation of large clear globules, and when this is apparent, the heating is turned off and the oil bath is removed. Vigorous stirring is continued, as the mixture cools to ambient temperature, and when the internal temperature is <30 \u00b0C, the slurry is immersed in an ice-water bath for one hour, during which time the tan solids adopt a more granular appearance. A 500-mL filter flask is fitted with a 7 cm porcelain filter funnel containing a paper filter, which is wetted with 2-3 mL of water. The slurry is filtered, and the cold filtrate (Note 7) is used to rinse the flask out and ensure maximum recovery of product (Note 8). The tan solids are allowed to suck dry on the filter for at least 5 min, and then scraped out onto a large piece of filter paper and any chunks are broken up with a spatula. The solids are then transferred into a tared 250-mL beaker, covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at ambient temperature for 3 days (Note 9) to afford a light tan granular solid. The mass of the dried product is 27.0 g that was confirmed to be 97% purity by quantitative NMR. KF of the isolated solids is 3.7%, which affords a corrected yield of 87% (Notes (Note 10), (Note 11), (Note 12), (Note 13) and (Note 14)).",

To the flask are then added 1 (14.46 g, estimated 97% potency, 91.5 mmol), tetra-butylammonium bromide (1.42 g, 99%, 4.40 mmol) (Note 16), toluene (100 mL) (Note 17) and a commercial solution of NaOH (110 mL, 2 M, 220.2 mmol) (Note 2). The funnel is replaced with a rubber septum, stirring started, and a six inch stainless steel syringe needle connected to a nitrogen source is inserted through the septum and placed below the level of the liquid in order to sparge the solution and headspace with a vigorous stream of nitrogen. Nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min, after which time Pd(dba)2 (0.20 g, 0.35 mmol) and Xantphos (0.31 g, 0.5 mmol) (Notes (Note 18) and (Note 19)) are added as solids by removing the septum rapidly, pouring in the solids, and then quickly replacing the septum. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the mixture for two additional minutes, after which time the top of the condenser is attached to a static-pressure nitrogen source. The mixture is heated to vigorous reflux (internal temperature 87 \u00baC) (Note 20) with stirring for 24 h (Notes (Note 21), (Note 22), and (Note 23)). After 24 h, the oil bath is turned off and removed, and the mixture is cooled to <30 \u00b0C by immersion into a cool water bath. A 500-mL filter flask is equipped with a 7 cm porcelain funnel and a filter paper. The paper is wetted with water, and the solids are isolated by filtration (Note 24). The flask is rinsed with toluene (25 mL) and this is used to rinse the solids on the filter. The solids are washed with water (25 mL) and then EtOH (25 mL) (Note 25) and allowed to suck dry for >5 min. The solids are scraped off the filter paper with a spatula onto a large piece of filter paper and any solids are broken up. The solids are placed in a tared 250-mL beaker and covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at 50 \u00b0C under full house vacuum for 17 h to afford 20.0 g of light yellow/green solids (100%) (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27)).",

Deionized water (100 mL) is added, followed by trifluoroacetic acid (9.9 mL, 99%, 127.0 mmol) (Note 29). The mixture is then heated to 95 \u00b0C, and a clear light green solution is formed, with some dark solids observed floating in the solution. Once the mixture has reached 95 \u00b0C, it is held at that temperature with stirring for three hours. After three hours, the oil bath is turned off and removed, and the solution is cooled to <60 \u00b0C, at which time EtOH (50 mL) is added (Note 25). The solution is then further cooled to <30 \u00b0C using a cool water bath. A second 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with two stoppers and a 4-cm coarse-fritted B\u00fcchner funnel (30 mL volume size) containing dry Celite\u2122 (4.00 g). A few mLs of water is used to wet the Celite\u2122 in order to form a filter pad. The Celite\u2122 filter pad is washed until the filtrate is no longer cloudy and then the collection flask is connected to the funnel. The reaction mixture is carefully filtered through the pad into the second 250 mL flask using gentle vacuum (Note 30). The reaction flask is rinsed with water (10 mL), which is then used to rinse the walls of the filter funnel and filter pad (Note 31). The filter and stoppers are removed, a pH probe is inserted through one of the unused side joints, and a Teflon stir paddle with a glass stir shaft assembly are introduced through the center joint and connected to an overhead stirrer (Note 32). A commercial solution of 5 N NaOH (25 mL) (Note 2) is then added via pipette rapidly at first and more slowly once pH 7 is reached, and the titration is continued until a final pH of 8-10 is reached (Notes (Note 33), (Note 34), (Note 35), and (Note 36)). Upon neutralization, the solution gradually turns cloudy over a few minutes, and crystallization ensues. The slurry is placed in an ice-water bath for one hour with stirring. A 250-mL filter flask is equipped with a 5 cm porcelain funnel and filter paper. The paper is wetted with water (1-2 mL) and the product is isolated by vacuum filtration. To the flask is added water (25 mL) and any residual solids in the flask are rinsed onto the filter cake. After 2-3 minutes on vacuum, the solids are then washed with additional water (25 mL), and then sucked dry for 5 minutes. The solids are scraped onto a large piece of filter paper, broken up with a spatula, placed into a tared 250-mL beaker and covered with a laboratory wipe, which is secured with a rubber band, and placed in vacuum oven at 50 \u00b0C under full house vacuum for 15 h to afford the product (g, 6.73 g, 89%) as a pale tan powdery solid (Note 37)."

The resulting white solid is collected on a 150-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, portions of the filtrate being used to rinse all solids out of the flask.

            "Nugent's morpholinoisoborneol (MIB) is an excellent ligand for the catalytic asymmetric addition of alkyl, vinyl, and aryl groups to aldehydes in the presence of organozinc reagents to furnish a variety of secondary alcohols with high ee.3,4,5 The major developments have been the significant broadening of the substrate scope and the development of several one-pot methods that streamline the synthesis of synthetically valuable and versatile molecules such as epoxy alcohols, allylic epoxy alcohols, cyclopropyl alcohols, halocyclopropyl alcohols, pyranones and 1,2,4-trioxanes with high enantio-, diastereo-, and chemoselectivity.6,7,8 In this update, we will summarize many of the advances.\nA detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of (-)-MIB has been published in Organic Syntheses.9 Starting from either (R)- or (S)-camphor, gram quantities of either enantiomer of MIB can be synthesized in three steps and with only a single purification step. At the time of this report, only (-)-MIB is commercially available.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Arylation of Aldehydes\nTwo routes for the catalytic asymmetric arylation of aldehydes to generate highly enantioenriched diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were reported (Figure 1).10 In the first route, diarylzinc intermediates were generated in situ by metalation of unfunctionalized aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by transmetalation with ZnCl2 (Figure 1A). The LiCl formed in the process catalyzes a rapid racemic background reaction. The Lewis acidic LiCl was selectively suppressed by addition of tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB and aldehyde to the preformed diarylzinc reagent gave addition products with high enantioselectivities (80-92%) and yields (78-99%). In the second route, mixed alkyl aryl zinc reagents were generated by metalation of aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by addition to ZnCl2 and subsequent addition of a second equivalent of n-BuLi. The mixed organozinc species was used in situ in the asymmetric addition reaction after addition of 0.8 equivalents of TEEDA (Figure 1B). Higher enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were achieved via this route. This methodology was extended to the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl- and diheteroarylmethanols with high levels of enantioselectivity.11\nFigure 1. Catalytic asymmetric aryl additions to aldehydes with (A) Ar2Zn and (B) ArZnBu from aryl bromides.\nCharette and coworkers introduced a complementary catalytic asymmetric arylation method by developing a salt-free preparation of diorganozinc reagents using Zn(OMe)2 and alkyl/aryl Grignard reagents (Figure 2).12 The insoluble salts Mg(OMe)2 and/or NaBr salts were removed by centrifugation or filtration to afford the salt-free diorganozinc reagents. Two examples highlighting the efficiency of this chemistry are illustrated in Figure 2. Ishihara and coworkers adopted Charette's method to synthesize salt-free i-Pr2Zn and subsequently added it to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB with up to 94% ee.13,14\nFigure 2. Charette's catalytic asymmetric (A) alkyl and (B) aryl additions.\n2. Synthesis of Chiral Acyclic Epoxy Alcohols\nIn an effort to streamline the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of valuable small molecules,6 the (-)-MIB-based organozinc catalyzed carbonyl addition step was merged with several other transformations such as epoxidation, cyclopropanation, halocyclopropanation, and various rearrangement reactions. The first tandem reaction developed was for the synthesis of chiral epoxy alcohols.\nFigure 3. Three one-pot synthesis of epoxy alcohols.\nTwo complementary methods were developed for one-pot synthesis of highly enantio- and diastereoenriched epoxy alcohols with up to three contiguous stereocenters.15,16,17 The first route involved highly enantioselective alkyl additions to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes followed by titanium-catalyzed diastereoselective epoxidation with either dioxygen or TBHP (Figure 3A). The second route involves highly enantioselective divinylzinc additions to aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes (Figure 3B). The vinylzinc reagents can be either isolated and purified prior to addition to aldehydes,18,19 or formed in situ by hydroboration of a terminal alkyne followed by transmetalation to zinc (Figure 3C).20 The latter method provided access to a synthetically challenging class of secondary trans-disubstituted epoxy alcohols with up to 4.5 : 1 dr. Excellent enantioselectivities were obtained with a wide range of aldehyde substitution patterns, except unbranched aldehydes, which undergo additions with up to 85% ee. This alkoxide-based titanium epoxidation catalyst is unique in that the same catalyst demonstrated high diastereoselectivity with allylic alkoxides exhibiting either A1,2 or A1,3 allylic strain in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states.\nSynthesis of Chiral Allylic Epoxy Alcohols\nAsymmetric vinylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of MIB generated unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide intermediates. In situ alkoxide directed epoxidation afforded densely functionalized allylic epoxy alcohols in good yields and excellent chemo-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity (Figure 4).16 The vinylzinc reagents may be either prepared and purified (Figure 4A) or generated in situ using Oppolzer's procedure.20\nFigure 4. Synthesis of allylic epoxy alcohols using (A) purified vinylzinc reagents, or (B) in situ generated vinylzinc reagents.\nThe latter procedure afforded only (E)-disubstituted vinylzinc reagents whereas the former allowed for more substituted vinylzinc reagents. The enal must bear non-hydrogen substituents in the R2 or R3 position so that either A1,2 or A1,3 strain is present in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states. The unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide then underwent a highly chemoselective directed epoxidation of the more electron-rich double bond while minimizing A1,2 or A1,3 strain.\nCatalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes\nThe vinylation procedures above provide (E)-allylic alcohols. Walsh and coworkers developed catalytic asymmetric (Z)-vinylation of aldehydes with (Z)-vinylzinc reagents via a novel 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence.21,22 Thus, hydroboration of 1-halo-1-alkynes followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium,23 transmetalation of the resulting (Z)-vinylboranes to zinc and addition to prochiral aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB and the diamine inhibitor TEEDA furnished (Z)-disubstituted allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity and without contamination by (E)-allylic alcohols (Scheme 1). This transformation is analogous to a net trans hydroboration of the corresponding alkynes. Aliphatic aldehydes with \u03b1-branching gave products of high enantiopurity whereas \u03b2-branched aldehydes gave lower enantioselectivities.\nScheme 1. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (Z)-allylic alcohols.\n4.1 Tandem Catalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes/Diastereoselective Epoxidation and Cyclopropanation\nThe generation and addition of (Z)-vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes were then applied to two one-pot tandem reactions. In the first tandem reaction, the resulting allylic alkoxides were treated with Et2Zn, TBHP, and Ti(Oi-Pr)4 to perform the diastereoselective and/or chemoselective epoxidation to synthesize epoxy alcohols and (Z)-allylic epoxy alcohols (Figure 5A).21 In the second tandem reaction, the allylic alkoxides were subjected to 5 equiv each of CF3CH2OH, Et2Zn, and CH2I2 to provide highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols (Figure 5B).24 A variety of 1-chloro-1-alkynes and aldehydes (saturated, aromatic, and heteroaromatic) were employed successfully in these tandem reactions.\nFigure 5. Tandem syntheses of (A) epoxy and allylic epoxy alcohols and (B) syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols.\n4.2 Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis (Z)-Trisubstituted Allylic Alcohols\nThe (Z)-vinyl zinc reagents generated were all disubstituted because the 1,2-metalate rearrangement was executed with a hydride source. A variant of the 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence for the stereospecific generation of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents was also developed.25 Hydroboration of 1-bromo-1-hexyne with either diethyl- or dicyclohexylborane followed by 3 equiv of diethylzinc provided the (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents. The dialkylzinc served a two-fold function: it induced a 1,2-metalate shift to form the new C-C bond and promoted the boron to zinc transmetallation. In the presence of TMEDA (to inhibit the zinc halide by-product) and catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB, these reagents were then employed in the catalytic asymmetric addition of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish enantioenriched (Z)-trisubsituted allylic alcohols in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, this procedure could not be adapted to the highly enantioselective synthesis of \u03b1-methyl-substituted allylic alcohols despite screening several additives (ee <30%, 15-50% yield).\nScheme 2. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1-ethyl and \u03b1-cyclohexyl (Z)-trisubstituted allylic alcohols.\nTandem Catalytic Asymmetric Addition/Diastereoselective Cyclopropanation\n5.1. Synthesis of syn-Cyclopropyl Alcohols. Two tandem routes have been developed to synthesize highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.26 The first route involved enantioselective alkyl addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB (Figure 6A) whereas the second route involved addition of vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish the allylic alkoxide intermediates (Figure 6B). After removal of the volatile materials, the intermediate allylic alkoxide was exposed to either EtZnCH2I or the more reactive CF3CH2OZnCH2I27 to furnish syn-cyclopropyl alcohols with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The first route has a broader substrate scope, but is more challenging because unsaturated aldehydes isomerize readily. The second route provides only (E)-disubstituted syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.\nFigure 6. Tandem asymmetric A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation and B) vinylation of aldehydes followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.2. Synthesis of Enantioenriched Dienols and syn-Vinylcyclopropanes\nThe catalytic enantioselective vinylation was extended to addition of dienyl groups to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB.24 The requisite dienyl zinc intermediates were synthesized via chemo- and regioselective hydroboration of enynes followed by transmetallation with diethylzinc. Dienols were obtained in 79-93% yield and 76-94% ee (Figure 7A).\nThis methodology was further extended to the synthesis of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The dienylzinc alkoxide intermediates were subjected to EtZnCH2I to provide vinyl cyclopropanes with high chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Figure 7B). The alkoxide directed cyclopropanation of allylic C=C bonds is faster than remote C=C bonds.28 A limitation of this method is that aromatic aldehydes were unsuccessful coupling partners.\nFigure 7. Asymmetric dienylation and diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.3. Synthesis of anti-Cyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe inherent bias for syn-selectivity in the alkoxide directed cyclopropanation could be switched to synthesize anti-cyclopropyl alcohols using a strategy developed by Charette and coworkers29 wherein allylic alcohols were protected with bulky silyl groups to prevent coordination to zinc carbenoids. In our method for the synthesis of anti-cyclopropanes,19 we silylated the intermediate zinc alkoxide in situ with TMSCl/Et3N and then subjected the silyl ether to cyclopropanation conditions. The cyclopropyl zinc alkoxides were desilylated in situ to furnish anti-cyclopropyl alcohols in 60-82% yield with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3). The Et3N is likely necessary to break up the zinc aggregates, rendering the zinc alkoxides more nucleophilic towards TMSCl.\nScheme 3. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of anti-cyclopropyl alcohols.\n5.4. Synthesis of syn-Halocyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe catalytic enantio- and diastereoselective tandem generation of cyclopropyl alcohols was extended to the synthesis of halo-substituted cyclopropyl alcohols.26,30 The enantioenriched zinc alkoxide intermediate was subjected to Et2Zn, CF3CH2OH, and either iodoform, bromoform or dichlorobromomethane to furnish iodo-, bromo- or chlorocyclopropyl alcohols respectively in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Figure 8A). In these one-pot tandem halocyclopropanation reactions, four consecutive stereogenic centers are established with excellent diastereoselectivity starting from simple achiral \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde precursors. Interrogation of the cyclopropyl stereochemistry via 1H NMR and X-ray analyses led to an interesting find; when R4 = alkyl or H, the halo group was cis to the carbinol, whereas when R4 = Ph, the halo group was trans. This switch in stereochemical bias was rationalized by invoking a zinc-phenyl-p interaction.31\nA complementary approach to iodocyclopropyl alcohols was developed using MIB-catalyzed asymmetric vinyl addition as the first step followed by subjection of the zinc alkoxide intermediate to 3 equiv of Zn(CHI2)2 (Figure 8B).30 The iodocyclopropyl alcohols can be further allylated with allyl/methallyl bromide in the presence of LiCu(n-Bu)2 to furnish 1,2,3-disubstituted cyclopropanes in good yields as single diastereomers with full retention of the cyclopropane stereochemistry (not shown).\nFigure 8. Tandem asymmetric (A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective halocyclopropanations and (B) vinyl addition to aldehydes followed by diastereoselective iodocyclopropanation.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Aminovinylation of Aldehydes: Synthesis of \u03b2-Hydroxyenamines, \u03b2-Aminoalcohols, and syn-Aminocyclopropyl Alcohols\nRegioselective hydroboration of ynamides followed by boron to zinc transmetallation and subsequent addition to aldehydes in the presence of 5 mol % (-)-MIB furnished \u03b2-hydroxyenamines in moderate yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee, Figure 9A).32\nA tandem catalytic asymmetric aminovinylation/diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction was developed to synthesize syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols with excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1) in moderate yields (Figure 9B).32\nFigure 9. A) Synthesis of \u03b2-hydroxyenamines and B) tandem synthesis of syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Ethoxyvinylation of Aldehydes\nHighly enantioselective addition of ethoxyvinyl zinc reagents, generated via hydroboration of ethoxyacetylene followed by in situ transmetalation to zinc and addition to aldehydes in presence of MIB afforded hydroxyenol ethers with high ee (89-95%) and yields (>93%, Scheme 4).33 Subsequent hydrolysis generated two carbon homologated enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes. In the case of addition to chiral \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes, mismatched and matched catalyst-substrate combinations can be used to achieve moderate to good diastereoselectivities of either the syn- (up to 3.8:1 with (-)-MIB) or anti-diols (>9:1 with (+)-MIB).\nScheme 4. One-pot tandem catalytic asymmetric ethoxyvinylation of aldehydes.\nOther uses of MIB in Organic Synthesis\n8.1. Synthesis of \u03b3Unsaturated \u03b2-Amino Acid Derivatives\nA catalytic enantioselective synthesis of \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives was achieved in three steps from trityl protected 1-butyne-3-ol.34 The enantioenriched allylic alcohols were transformed into the corresponding allylic amines via a [3,3]-sigmatropic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, and led to \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives with high ee after a one-pot deprotection-oxidation sequence (Scheme 5). Similar [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions were executed to access enantioenriched allylic amines en route to the syntheses of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (Figure 10).35,36\nScheme 5. Asymmetric synthesis of \u03b3unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\nFigure 10. [3,3]-Sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions en route to the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D.\n8.2. Synthesis of Di(allyl) Ether Derivatives\nNelson and coworkers added Et2Zn to conjugated enals in the presence of MIB followed by O-allylation of the enantioenriched zinc alkoxides to provide di(allyl) ethers in good yields (73-87%) and high ee (88-98%).37,38,39 Subsequent olefin isomerization and Claisen rearrangement provided access to a variety of enantio- and diastereoenriched Claisen adducts (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6. Asymmetric synthesis of di(allyl) derivatives.\n8.3. One-pot Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyranones\nEnantioenriched pyranones with >90% ee were prepared via a one-pot tandem asymmetric alkylation of 2-furfurals in the presence of catalytic (-)-MIB followed by oxidation with NBS (Scheme 7).40\nScheme 7. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched pyranones.\n8.4. Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched 1,2,4- Trioxanes\nEnantioenriched allylic alcohols can be subjected to a hydroxyl directed regio- and diastereoselective photooxygenation reaction with O2 in the presence of tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) to obtain allylic hydroperoxides in >10:1 dr, with the threo-isomer as the major product (Scheme 8).41 The allylic hydroperoxides were further reacted with cyclic ketones in the presence of catalytic p-TsOH to yield enantioenriched 1,2,4-trioxanes (16-78% yield) that exhibited antimalarial activity.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroperoxy alcohols and 1,2,4-trioxanes.\n8.5. Polystyrene-supported MIB-derived Ligands\nPericas and coworkers have successfully synthesized and immobilized 3-exopiperazinoisoborneol (PIB), a close analog of MIB, to Merrifield resins (Scheme 9).42 Polystyrene-supported PIB possessed high catalytic activity and improved chemical stability, and was employed as a ligand (10 mol %) in the asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes with Et2Zn in batch methods to produce highly enantioenriched alcohols in good yields (50-92% y, 92-99% ee). This method is amenable to continuous flow methods for over 30 h with high conversion and no erosion in enantioselectivity. In this fashion, industrial scale amounts (13.0 g) of enantiopure alcohol were isolated in a single continuous flow operation leading to >30 fold better performance compared to batch conditions (TON = 251 with respect to the product).\nScheme 9. Synthesis of polystyrene-supported PIB\n8.6. MIB in Syntheses of Natural Products\nOver the years, MIB has been employed in the synthesis of a number of natural products. In all of these syntheses, MIB has been primarily used in asymmetric alkylation or vinylation reactions to provide diastereo- and enantioenriched alcohols.35,36,41,43,44 In their formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A, Hong and coworkers employed (-)-MIB in the diastereoselective vinylation of a chiral aldehyde to furnish the requisite allylic alcohol with >32:1 diastereoselectivity (Figure 11).44 The enantio- and diastereoselective addition step can be further coupled with efficient transformations en route to synthesis of natural products. As outlined earlier, a [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reaction was employed in the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (jaspine B) (Figure 10)35,36 while a diastereoselective Schenk ene reaction with singlet oxygen was utilized in the synthesis of artemisin-type 1,2,4-trioxanes (Scheme 8).41 It is hopeful that synthetic chemists will adopt the tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations reactions presented herein in efficient synthesis of their natural products.\nFigure 11. Hong and coworkers diastereoselective vinyl carbonyl addition in the formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A.\nBoth Nugent's (+)- and (-)-MIB have found significant synthetic utility as a ligand of choice for addition of organozinc groups to carbonyl compounds. The efficient installation of chirality, coupled with tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations, provides high-value added building blocks that augment the synthetic organic chemist's repertoire of enantioenriched small molecules."

The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with half-saturated brine, then dried by filtration through 50 g anhydrous sodium sulfate into a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The contents are concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature: 40 \u00b0C; 100 to 50 mmHg, foaming) (38 g). Methyl t-butyl ether (150 mL) is added to the flask and concentrated (bath temperature: 40 \u00b0C; 100 to 50 mmHg, foaming) to an orange oil (35 g).

            "Reductive coupling reactions are among the most useful strategies for the efficient synthesis of complicated molecules and physiologically active molecules.2 We reported for the first time that Ni-catalysts are able to promote the homoallylation of aldehydes with a wide variety of 1,3-dienes in the presence of triethylborane or diethylzinc to yield bishomoallyl alcohols with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities.3 Based on these procedures, the scope of reductive coupling reactions have been significantly expanded in recent years. Herein, the scope of the homoallylation of aldehydes and ketones with conjugated dienes, asymmetric homoallylations of carbonyls, synthesis of natural products involving Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling, and bis-metallic homoallylations are summarized.\nScope of Homoallylation of Carbonyls with Various Conjugated Dienes\nThe results of the Ni-catalyzed homoallylation of benzaldehyde with conjugated dienes bearing electron-donating substituents, such as siloxy and alkoxy groups, were described (Table 1).4 C1- and C2-siloxy-1,3-butadienes reacted with benzaldehyde highly regio- and stereoselectively and furnished homoallyation products as a single isomer in good to excellent yields. A siloxy group surpasses a methyl group in regiocontrolling effect; a substituted 1,3-butadiene possessing a siloxy group at C2 and a methyl group at C3 reacted with benzaldehyde via the C1 carbon atom to afford 4-methyl-3-siloxy-4-penten-1-ol exclusively (entry 2, Table 1). While a C2-siloxy group enhanced the reactivity of butadiene at the C1 position, a C1-siloxy group induced reactivity at the C4 position exclusively (entries 3-5, Table 1). The present homoallylation with siloxy and methoxy-substituted butadienes is of great synthetic value as synthetic equivalents of functionalized butenyl carbanion and not as silyl enol ethers.\nTable 1. Ni-Catalyzed Homoallylation of Aldehydes with Conjugated Diene\nCyclohexadiene failed to react with benzaldehyde using the Ni/Et3B system, whereas the Ni/Et2Zn system accelerated the reaction (Figure 1). However, the major product was syn-1-(2-cyclohexenyl)-1-phenylmethanol, which was obtained by nucleophilic allylation of benzaldehyde with 2-cyclohexenyl benzoate through umpolung of \u03c0-allylpalladium.5\nFigure 1. Ni-Catalyzed Allylation of PhCHO with 1,3-Cyclohexadiene\nAsymmetric reductive coupling of dienes and aldehydes was also reported. When Ni-catalyzed homoallylation of aldehydes with 1,3-dienes was performed with bulky spirobiindane phosphoramidite ligands and diethylzinc as a reducing agent, chiral bishomoallyl alcohols were produced in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities (Figure 2).6\nFigure 2. Asymmetric Ni-Catalyzed Homoallylation of Aldehydes\nFigure 3. Formal Synthesis of C1-C9 Fragment of Amphidinolide C\nNi-catalyzed homoallylation of aldehydes with isoprene served as an important synthetic strategy for the construction of the tetrahydrofuran fragment from amphidinolide C (Figure 3).7 Homoallylation of erythrolactol followed by cross metathesis of the hydroxyl alkene with methyl acrylate afforded \u03c9-hydroxy \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters, which underwent cyclization upon treatment with DBU to produce tetrahydrofurans with the correct relative configuration for the C1-C9 fragment of amphidinolide C.\nBismetallative Homoallylation of Aldehydes with Dienes\nNickel-catalyzed borylative coupling reactions of diene and aldehyde were studied. In the presence of Ni catalyst, phosphine ligand, and bis(pinacolato)diboron, benzaldehyde reacted with 1,3-dienes, followed by oxidative hydrolysis with hydrogen peroxide, to provide 4-pentene-1,3-diols and 2-pentene-1,5-diols (Figure 4).8 In this case, bis(pinacolato)diboron participated in the \u03c3-bond metathesis providing access to allyl boronic esters. Their selectivity depends on the kind of phosphine ligands. Homoallylation products were observed exclusively using the P(SiMe3)3 ligand, whereas P(t-Bu)3 provided allylation products. This borylative carbonyl-diene coupling reaction could be extended to the reaction of ketones, which afforded to afford bis-bishomoallyl alcohols using Ni(cod)2/P(t-Bu)3 as catalyst, in contrast to the allylation product regioselectivities obtained with aldehydes.\nFigure 4. Borylative Coupling Reaction of Diene and Carbonyls\nNi-catalyzed silylborative coupling reactions with aldehydes and 1,3-dienes gave the corresponding bishomoallyl alcohols having an allylsilane unit in the side chain (Figure 5).9 This procedure was applied to the synthetic approach to optically active \u03b1-chiral allylsilane derivatives.\nFigure 5. Borylative Coupling Reaction of Diene and Carbonyls\nTransition Metal Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Aldehydes with Dienes Promoted by Triethylborane\nTransition metal catalyzed C-C bond formations involving conjugated dienes and carbonyls have been developed. When a mixture of 1,3-diene and aldehyde is used in the presence of triethylborane, the reaction changes dramatically depending on the kind of transition metal catalysts. Rh(I) catalysts promote the reductive coupling reaction of a wide variety of aldehydes with conjugated dienes in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of triethylborane to provide homoallyl alcohols in good yields (Figure 6).10 Isoprene reacts with benzaldehyde at the C3- and C2-positions to give a regioisomeric mixture of 3-butenyl alcohols in a 6:1 ratio. Methyl sorbate reacts with aldehydes at the \u03b1-carbon position with excellent stereoselectivity producing the (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol framework as a single isomer. The similar coupling reactions of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes were observed by employment of Ru and Ir catalysts using isopropyl alcohol and formic acid as reducing agents (Figure 7).11\nFigure 6. Rh(I) Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Aldehydes and Dienes\nFigure 7. Ru-Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Aldehydes and Dienes\nA combination of Pd-catalyst/Xantphos and triethylborane promoted the ene-type reaction of aldehydes and conjugated dienes to afford dienyl homoallyl alcohols in excellent yields (Figure 8).12 Methyl sorbate underwent formal Baylis-Hillman type C-C bond formation at the \u03b1-position to provide (2E,4E)-hexadien-1-ol with excellent stereoselectivity.\nFigure 8. Pd/Xantphos Promoted Coupling Reaction of Aldehydes and Conjugated Dienes Promoted by Triethylborane\nThus, the combination of transition metal catalyst and triethylborane nicely promoted the coupling reaction of carbonyls and conjugated dienes to furnish the stereodefined bishomoallyl and homoallyl alcohols. The reductive coupling reactions offer great efficiency and a useful strategy for the synthesis of important physiologically active molecules, such as terpene alcohols and macrolides."

            "A. Fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (1) (Note 1). An oven-dried (140 \u00b0C for 12 h) 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (25 x 8 mm, octagonal) is charged with spray-dried potassium fluoride (8.80 g, 152 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2) and 18-crown-6 (2.01 g, 7.6 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 3). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, into which is inserted a syringe needle attached to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen 3 times. Anhydrous acetonitrile (50 mL) (Note 4) and chloromethyl phenyl sulfide (10.2 mL, 12.10 g, 76.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added successively to the flask by syringe. A reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adaptor is quickly attached and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen three times. The stirred reaction mixture is heated to reflux in an oil bath (102-103 \u00b0C, bath temp) for 120 h (Note 6). The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice bath (0 \u00b0C, bath temp) (Note 7), diluted with ice water (50 mL) (Note 8), and transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. The mixture is extracted with methylene chloride (4 x 25 mL, Note 9) (Note 10). The combined organic layer is washed with water (30 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 10 g, 15 min) (Note 11), and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (23 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) to give crude fluoromethyl phenyl sulfide as a brownish oil (10.04-10.25 g, 93-95%) that is directly subjected to oxidation. To a 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (50 x 8 mm, octagonal) (Note 12) is added Oxone\u00ae (116.80 g, 190 mmol KHSO5, 2.6 equiv) (Note 13) and distilled water (175 mL). The flask is capped loosely with a septum and placed in an ice bath. The septum is replaced with an addition funnel and a solution of crude fluoromethyl phenyl sulfide (10.20 g, 72 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in methanol (175 mL) (Note 14) is added dropwise over ca. 1 h (Note 15). The reaction mixture is allowed to slowly warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 h. Methanol is removed via rotary evaporation (45 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) (Note 16). The resulting residue contains a large amount of insoluble white precipitate, which is removed by filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 17). The funnel is rinsed with methylene chloride (2 x 30 mL) and the filtrate is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. After layer separation, the aqueous layer is further extracted with methylene chloride (Note 18) (5 \u00d7 30 mL, Note 9). The organic layers are combined, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 10 g, 15 min) (Note 11), filtered, and concentrated to ca. 40 mL of a pale yellow solution. The solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (230-400 mesh, 100 mL), which is further washed with methylene chloride (ca. 250 mL, Note 9) to give a clear solution (Note 19). The filtrate is concentrated via rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 2 mmHg) and then placed under vacuum (room temperature, ca. 0.2-0.3 mmHg, 15-30 min) to result in a clear or slightly yellowish oil, which slowly solidifies at room temperature under vacuum. The solid is stirred with hot hexanes (ca. 50 mL, 60~65 \u00b0C) (Note 20) for 20 min, which forms two layers. Upon cooling to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath, the bottom layer gradually crystallizes to yield colorless crystals over 15 min, which are collected by filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold (0 \u00b0C) hexanes (2 x 10 mL) (Note 21) to afford fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (1) (10.99-12.18 g, 83-92%) (Note 22).",
            "B. a-Fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) (2). An oven-dried (140 \u00b0C, 12 h) 250-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar (25 x 8 mm, octagonal), is charged with potassium hydride (21.80 g, 30% wt in oil, 163 mmol, 2.7 equiv) (Note 23), sealed with a rubber septum and connected through a syringe needle to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times and then placed in an ice bath. Excess oil is removed as follows. Anhydrous hexanes (20 mL) (Note 24) are added to the flask via syringe. The mixture is gently stirred for 10 min and allowed to stand unstirred for another 10 min before the removal of the hexanes-oil solution with a syringe. The hexanes-oil solution is added dropwise to an isopropyl alcohol solution. This washing procedure is repeated two more times. Anhydrous THF (130 mL) is then added (Note 25). Hexamethyldisilazane (40.9 mL, 31.5 g, 195 mmol, 3.2 equiv) (Note 26) is then added portion-wise to the stirred solution via syringe over a period of 20-30 min. The hydrogen evolution ceases within 15 min after the addition. The ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand without stirring for 30 min at room temperature before use (Note 27). An oven dried (140 \u00b0C, 12 h) 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (37.5 x 8 mm, octagonal) is charged with fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (1) (10.66 g, 61.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and connected through a syringe needle to a nitrogen/vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen three times. Benzenesulfonyl fluoride (7.37 mL, 9.80 g, 61.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 28) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 25) are added successively via syringe. The flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (-78 \u00b0C) and the stirred contents are treated with the KHMDS solution in tetrahydrofuran prepared above (Note 29), which is added dropwise via cannula (Note 30) over 30 min. During the course of the addition, the reaction mixture becomes brownish, cloudy, and viscous. After 30 min at -78 \u00b0C, the reaction mixture is quenched by transfer via cannula over 30 min to another 500-mL round-bottomed flask maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere containing a stirred solution of 4M HCl (185 mL) (Note 31). The resultant mixture appears as a single opaque layer and is extracted with methylene chloride in a 500 mL separatory funnel (5 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with brine (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (ca. 15 g, 15 min) (Note 11), and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated via rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C bath temp, 2 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (room temperature, ca. 0.2-0.3 mmHg) to afford crude a-fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (2) as a colorless solid (18.28 g, 95%). Examination by 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectroscopy shows the crude product (2) to be satisfactory for most preparative purposes (>98% purity) (Note 32). Compound 2 can be further purified by recrystallization in methylene chloride and hexanes as follows. The crude product is placed in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. Methylene chloride (35 mL) is added and the mixture is heated to reflux to dissolve the product. Hexanes (ca. 30 mL) are slowly added portion-wise through the top of the condenser, while maintaining the reflux. The solution is slowly cooled to room temperature. The solution is then transferred to a refrigerator set to 5 \u00b0C and held for 2 h. The resulting white precipitate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, rinsed with 25 mL cold methylene chloride/hexanes (1:1, v/v; 0 \u00b0C) and allowed to air dry on the funnel for 15 min and then placed on a vacuum line for 15 min (rt, 0.2-0.3 mmHg) to render 14.04 g of 2. The mother liquor is further concentrated to approximately one-half volume. An additional 20 mL of cold hexanes (0 \u00b0C) is then added causing the solution to become cloudy. After 15 minutes without stirring an additional 2.51 g of FBSM is isolated by the above mentioned procedure (combined yield 16.55 g, 85%) (Notes 32 and 33)."

The filtrate and washes from the initial crystallization are concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u00baC, 20 mmHg) in a l-L flask to afford 4 g of solids. Toluene (15 mL) is added along with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar. The mixture is warmed in a 60 \u00baC water bath to dissolve all solids, then allowed to cool to room temperature, upon which crystallization occurs. n-Heptane (60 mL) is added via a 150-mL addition funnel over 1 h, then the mixture is stirred for 14 h at room temperature. The suspension is filtered through a 150-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, washed with 4:1 n-heptane:toluene (2 x 10 mL), and air-dried to afford 1-naphthol as a pink solid (2.32 g). The two crops are combined (14.3 g, 89 % yield) (Notes 17 and 18)."

            "Prior and subsequent to our original report in Organic Syntheses, we have described a number of highly diastereoselective Lewis acid-mediated additions of titanium enolates from chiral N-acyl thiazolidinethiones to acetals.2 These involve the addition of N-propanoyl and N-acetyl-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione to dialkyl acetals (eq 1 and 2 in Scheme 1)3-5 and dimethyl ketals from methyl ketones (eq 3 in Scheme 1).6 Furthermore, the scope of the acyl groups has been recently expanded to N-glycolyl derivatives. Especially, O-pivaloyl protected N-glycolyl 4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione undergoes highly diastereoselective additions to a wide array of dimethyl and dibenzyl acetals (eq 4 in Scheme 1).7\nScheme 1. Stereoselective additions of titanium enolates from N-acyl-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione to dialkyl acetals and ketals\nThese reactions likely proceed through a mechanism in which an oxocarbenium intermediate approaches to the less hindered face of the titanium enolate. Taking advantage of such a picture, this chemistry has been successfully applied to glycals. Thereby, activation of glycals by Lewis acids triggers the formation of cyclic and conjugated oxocarbenium intermediates that may participate in highly diastereoselective \u03b1- and \u03b2-C-glycosidation processes with the abovementioned titanium enolates. Importantly, the appropriate choice of the chiral auxiliary and the C6-protecting group determines the stereochemical outcome of these carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and permits the modular preparation of three of the four possible diastereomers of \u03b1- or \u03b2-1'-methyl-substituted C-glycosides (Scheme 2).8-10\nScheme 2. Stereoselective C-glycosidation reactions\nSynthetic applications\nThese methods have been already applied to the synthesis of natural products. For instance, our group took advantage of the Lewis acid-mediated addition of the titanium enolates from (S) N-acetyl and N-propanoyl 4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thiones (1 and 2 respectively in Scheme 3) to dialkyl acetals for the construction of the C9-C21 fragment of debromoaplysiatoxin.11 As shown in Scheme 3, chromatographic purification of the product formed from the reaction between 1 and the dimethyl acetal of an aromatic aldehyde afforded diastereomerically pure adduct 3 in 82% yield. Removal of the chiral auxiliary gave alcohol 4, which was further elaborated to chiral dibenzyl acetal 5. Then, the stage was set for the introduction of two new stereocenters. Indeed, the asymmetric induction imparted by the titanium enolate of 2 and the Felkin bias of the oxocarbenium cation from 5 provided adduct 6 as a single diastereomer (dr > 98:2) in 74% yield. Finally, treatment of 6 with MeNHOMe furnished Weinreb amide 7 in 90% yield.12\nScheme 3. Stereoselective synthesis of C9-C21 fragment of debromoaplysiatoxin\nCrimmins and Chakraborty have also used these transformations in the total syntheses of pironetin and a protected form of the monomeric unit of rhizopodin respectively (Scheme 4).13,14 Thereby, Crimmins reported that the addition of 2 to a chiral dimethyl acetal provided adduct 8 as a single diastereomer in 64% yield, which was further converted into aldehyde 9 by treatment with i-Bu2AlH (eq 1 in Scheme 4).13 In turn, Chakraborty described a similar process involving an achiral dimethyl acetal in which adduct 10 was obtained in an excellent diastereomeric ratio (dr 93:7) and 86% yield (eq 2 in Scheme 4).14 Interestingly, removal of the chiral auxiliary by the lithium salt of the dimethyl methylphosphonate furnished ketophosphonate 11 ready to participate in an HWE olefination.\nScheme 4. Total syntheses of pironetin and a monomeric unit of rhizopodin\nOther reports have also established that these Lewis acid acid-mediated couplings of N-acyl thiazolidinethiones and acetals are flexible enough to be successfully adapted to the synthesis of a broad array of natural products. For instance, Crimmins took advantage of the highly diastereoselective reaction of the titanium enolate from N-(4-pentenoyl) thiazolidinethione 12 and a dibenzyl acetal, the mild removal of the chiral auxiliary from adduct 13, and the RCM of the resultant alcohol 14 to obtain in a few steps the cyclic core 15 of aldigenin B (eq 1 in Scheme 5).15 In turn, Hodgson reported that the addition of the titanium enolate of (R)-phenylglycine-derived N-acetyl thiazolidinethione 16 to the benzaldehyde diallyl acetal provided diastereomerically pure adduct 17 in 74% yield after chromatography. Further treatment of this adduct with magnesium acetoacetate and imidazole led to \u03b2-keto ester 18, a key intermediate in the total synthesis of hyperolactone C (eq 2 in Scheme 5).16 Finally, the synthesis of hennoxazole A by Smith includes a comprehensive study on the Lewis acid-mediated additions of N-acetyl thiazolidinethiones to the dimethyl acetal of bisoxazole 19.17 This revealed that the ability of an oxazole nitrogen atom to coordinate with the titanium center altered the stereochemical outcome of such additions and the undesired diastereomer was obtained in 80:20 diastereomeric ratio and 67% yield. Looking for alternative conditions, Smith found that the enolization of N-acetyl thiazolidinethione 20 using Sammakia's conditions (PhBCl2/sparteine) followed by the BF3\u00b7OEt2-mediated addition of the resultant boron enolate to 19 provided the desired adduct 21 in 86:14 diastereomeric ratio and 53% yield (eq 3 in Scheme 5). Eventually, reduction of 21 with i-Bu2AlH gave aldehyde 22, which was immediately used in the next step.\nScheme 5. Total syntheses of aldigenin B, hyperolactone C, and hennoxazole\nDialkyl acetals are not the only suitable substrates for these transformations. Certainly, oxocarbenium cations from cyclic hemiacetals and glycals (see Scheme 2) can also undergo highly diastereoselective additions to titanium enolates from N-acyl thiazolidinethiones, as was used by our group in the stereoselective synthesis of the western hemisphere of salinomycin. Indeed, the SnCl4-mediated addition of the titanium enolate from N-butanoyl thiazolidinethione 23 to hemiacetal 24 afforded \u03b1-C-glycoside 25 as a single diastereomer (dr > 97:3), which was treated with methanol to obtain methyl ester 26 in 75% overall yield (eq 1 in Scheme 6).18 More recently, Leighton has reported that the coupling of structurally complex O-acetyl hemiacetal 27 with the titanium enolate of ent-2 produced \u03b1-C-glycoside 28 as a single diastereomer in an outstanding 91% yield (eq 2 in Scheme 6).19 Methanolysis proceeded exceptionally smoothly to give 29 in quantitative yield, which was finally converted into zincophorin methyl ester in a few steps.\nScheme 6. Syntheses of antibiotic polyethers\nIn summary, the Lewis acid-mediated addition of titanium enolates from N-acyl thiazolidinethiones to dialkyl acetals, hemiacetals, or glycals represents a powerful synthetic tool for the stereoselective construction of carbon-carbon bonds leading to anti \u03b1-alkyl-\u03b2-alkoxy carboxylic derivatives. Importantly, the chiral auxiliary can be easily removed using a number of mild conditions, which confers to these methodologies a remarkable appeal for the synthesis of natural products."

Solid (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (\"DIB,\" 23.9 g, 74.2 mmol, 1.35 equiv) (Note 1) is added under purging N2 followed by CH3CN (480 mL) (Note 2). The flask is purged for 5 min and the contents are maintained under inert atmosphere during all subsequent operations. The stirrer is set to 560 rpm and neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 6.4 mL, 83.6 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 3) is carefully added via syringe over 3 min at room temperature, whereupon the mixture becomes homogeneous.\nA solution of methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (1) (9.1 g, 54.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) in CH3CN (20 mL), prepared in a flame-dried 50-mL round-bottomed flask, is added to the DIB solution over 3 h via syringe pump (Note 5). During the addition, the tip of the needle is immersed into the solution to a depth of 0.5 inch and the progress of the reaction is followed by TLC (Note 6). At the end of the addition (Note 7), the solution turns light brown. The mixture is transferred to a one-necked 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated under reduced pressure (mechanical pump vacuum, 175 mmHg) at 32 \u00b0C (rotary evaporator bath temperature). Toluene (10 mL) (Note 8) is then added and the resulting suspension is concentrated under reduced pressure to azeotropically remove residual TFA. Addition of toluene and evaporation are repeated twice again to ensure removal of essentially all of the TFA.\nThe resultant residue is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) (Note 9) and silica gel (40.0 g) (Note 10) is added to the solution. The CH2Cl2 is then removed under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator, 175 mmHg, 32 \u00b0C). Residual solvent is further removed under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg). The resultant free-flowing powder is loaded onto a chromatography column (3.0 inches in diameter) that had been dry-packed with silica (160.0 g). A layer of sand (1.0 inch) was placed on top of the dry silica and a mobile phase (gradient 50%, 75%, 100% EtOAc/Hexanes, 25%, 50%, 75% MeCN/ CH2Cl2, 200 mL each) (Notes 11 and 12) is passed through the silica, followed by MeCN (400 mL) to flush out the remaining product. The fractions determined to contain product via TLC analysis (Note 6) are combined and concentrated via rotary evaporator. (Note 13) Further solvent removal under high vacuum provides the pure product (2) as a brown solid (7.7 g, 34.5 mmol, 63% yield) (Notes 14 and 15)."

With no precautions to exclude air or moisture, a 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (38 x 16 mm). 4-Bromoaniline (Note 2) (15.1 g, 88.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 3) (17.1 g, 89.8 mmol, 1.02 equiv) are weighed into plastic weigh boats and added to the vessel through a powder funnel. Dichloromethane (Note 4) (230 mL) is then poured into the vessel from a graduated cylinder, followed by the addition of pyridine (Note 5) (7.8 mL, 97 mmol, 1.1 equiv) by syringe in two portions. The reaction vessel is stoppered with a rubber septum and an 18-gauge needle to vent the reaction to air before stirring (~500 rpm) at room temperature (20 \u00b0C) for 16 h.The reaction mixture turns from yellow to clear orange immediately after the addition of pyridine.After the reaction is judged complete by TLC analysis (Note 6), the reaction mixture is poured into a 2 L separatory funnel containing 800 mL of sat. NH4Cl(aq) (Note 7). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layer is then washed with water (400 mL), brine (400 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (10.0 g, ~1 min) (Note 8).The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass B\u00fcchner funnel.The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg) to yield 28.5-28.6 g (99% yield) of N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide as a white solid (Note 9).",
            "B. Ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)butanoate (2). A 500-mL 3-necked Morton flask with 24/40 ground-glass joints is equipped with a nitrogen-gas inlet on the left neck, a glass stopper on the right neck, and the center neck is equipped for mechanical stirring (glass bearing, glass stirrer rod, 60 mm PTFE paddle, RW 20 Tekmar motor) (Note 10). NiI2.xH2O (528 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv) (Note 11), 4,4'-di-methoxy-2,2'-bipyridine (284 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv) (Note 12), sodium iodide (1.25 g, 8.34 mmol, 0.33 equiv) (Note 13), and N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (8.33 g, 25.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) are transferred via powder funnel through the right neck of the Morton flask.To these solids, 1,3-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU, 105 mL) (Note 14) is added from a graduated cylinder.Then pyridine (105 \u03bcL, 1.31 mmol, 0.053 equiv) (Note 5) and ethyl 4-bromobutyrate (4.0 mL, 28 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 15) are added by syringe.A gas outlet adapter with tubing attached to an oil-filled bubbler is placed in the right neck before submerging the reaction vessel up to the solvent line in an oil bath pre-equilibrated to 60 \u00b0C.The vessel headspace is purged with nitrogen for 15 min while the mixture is stirred (500-600 rpm) (Note 16).After the nitrogen purge is complete, the gas outlet on the right neck is replaced with the original glass stopper and the reaction mixture is stirred at 60 \u00b0C until the reaction mixture takes on a dark green color (15-30 min) (Note 17). Next, zinc powder (6-9 \u03bcm, 3.44 g, 52.6 mmol, 2.06 equiv) (Note 18) is added through a powder funnel attached to the right neck under a positive flow of nitrogen.The flask is kept under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen during the course of the reaction.Generally within 5-15 min after the addition of zinc, the reaction undergoes a characteristic dark green to orange-brown color change, indicating the reaction has begun.The reaction is judged complete when the color changes to black (Note 19).\nOnce the reaction mixture changes color to black, it is allowed to cool to room temperature before filtering though a pad of diatomaceous earth (15 g, wetted with 40 mL of diethyl ether and packed firmly in place) (Note 20) in a 350-mL course-fritted glass B\u00fcchner funnel.The reaction vessel is rinsed with ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 21) and these rinses are filtered as well.The filtrate is poured into a 1 L separatory funnel containing 150 mL of 1 M NH4Cl(aq). The organic layer is separated and set aside.The aqueous layer is then extracted with additional ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (75 mL) and brine (75 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (15 g, ~1 min). The solids are removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass Buchner funnel and washed with ether (20 mL). The filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg) to give a colorless oil.The aqueous layers are combined and set aside for later recovery of DMPU, if desired (Note 22).\nThe oil is purified by stepped-gradient flash chromatography on silica gel (column diameter 90 mm, 225 g SiO2) (Note 23).The column is dry-packed with silica gel, equilibrated with hexanes (500 mL, passed through the column twice) (Note 24), and the compound is loaded directly onto the silica with dichloromethane (3 mL). The vessel containing the crude material is rinsed with 95:5 hexanes:EtOAc (5 mL), and additional dichloromethane (5 mL), which are then used to rinse the sides of the column (Note 25). After adding a layer of sand (~12 mm.) to the column, the compound is eluted with the following ratios (v:v) of hexanes:EtOAc: 95:5 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 90:10 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 85:15 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 80:20 (500 mL), 75:25 (1000 mL), 70:30 (500 mL), 65:35 (500 mL), and 60:40 (500 mL) (Note 26).Fractions are collected in 25 mm x 150 mm test-tubes (~65-70 mL).The fractions containing only product as determined by TLC (Note 19) are rinsed with EtOAc into a tared 1 L recovery flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 74 mmHg).A small, tared PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar (7 mm x 2 mm) is added to the viscous, colorless oil before drying on high vacuum (0.1 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C) for 1 h to remove any traces of solvent.A heat gun is used to gently warm the oil while on high vacuum and the heat is removed as soon as gas bubbles begin to evolve.After drying, the flask contained 7.16-7.70 g (78%-83% yield) (Note 27) of ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)-butanoate as a colorless viscous oil."

            "A. 2-Bromo-2-cyclohexen-1-one. A 3-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar (PTFE-coated, oval, 4 cm), is charged with cyclohex-2-enone (15.0 g, 156 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and CH2Cl2 (150 mL) (Note 1). The center neck is fitted with a 25-mL addition funnel equipped with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. One outer neck is sealed with a glass stopper; the other neck is capped with a rubber septum through which a thermocouple probe is inserted (Note 2). The flask is immersed in a dry ice/acetonitrile bath and stirring is begun. After the internal temperature reaches -45 \u00b0C, HBr (48% aq. solution, 3.6 mL, 32 mmol, 0.2 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe through the septum in 1 min. The addition funnel is charged with neat Br2 (9.0 mL, 175 mmol, 1.1 equiv), which is then added dropwise until the orange-red color indicative of excess bromine persists (Note 3). After 10 min, the addition funnel is replaced by a clean 125-mL addition funnel charged with pyridine (25.5 mL, 316 mmol, 2.0 equiv), which is then added dropwise over 15 min (Note 4). After the addition, the cold bath is removed and the dropping funnel is replaced by a reflux condenser equipped with a gas inlet adapter, which is connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min, then heated to reflux (43 \u00b0C) for 1 h using a heating mantle. After cooling to room temperature the flask contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the reaction flask is washed with CH2Cl2 (50 mL), and the additional solution is added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is washed with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (0.7 M, 150 mL). The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 1M HCl (100 mL). The organic layer is removed and the acidic, aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL). The combined organic fraction is washed with water (50 mL), brine (50 mL), and then filtered through a bed of Na2SO4 (50 g) into a tared 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 200 mmHg) to about 60 mL (84 g), then hexanes (100 mL) are added and the concentration continued to dryness (Note 5). Vacuum drying (10 mmHg) to constant weight (1.5 h) affords crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexenen-1-one (26.7 g, 98% yield) as a slightly yellow powder. The crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexen-1-one is suitable for the cyanation-elimination reaction without purification (Notes 6, 7, 8).\nCaution! Sodium cyanide and HCN are extremely toxic. The experimentalist should use sufficient personal protection and only handle sodium cyanide solid and solutions in a well-ventilated fume hood. The aqueous waste solutions containing cyanide should be treated with excess bleach before disposal.2 Good housekeeping is essential - all spills around balances or work areas should be immediately cleaned up and the area washed down with bleach.",

A 500-mL round-bottomed flask is charged with MeOH (120 mL) (Note 9), crude 2-bromo-2-cyclohexen-1-one (18.6 g, 106 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and a magnetic stir bar (PTFE-coated, oval, 3 cm). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and inserting an 18-gauge needle through the septum provides a nitrogen inlet. A thermocouple probe is also inserted through the septum (Note 2). The reaction flask is immersed in a tap-water bath and then neat AcOH (6.5 mL, 114 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise to the stirred solution via syringe over 1 min. After 5 min, the septum is briefly removed, solid NaCN (5.68 g, 116 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added in one portion, and the septum is replaced (Note 10). After 10 min a second portion of NaCN (2.73 g, 56 mol, 0.5 equiv) is added, followed, after another 10 min, by a third portion of NaCN (1.25 g, 26 mmol, 0.25 equiv), replacing the septum after each addition. After 20 min (Note 11), the water bath is replaced with an ice-water bath. Once the flask contents equilibrate to 5 \u00b0C, the septum is removed, and an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.5 M, 100 mL) is added. After 1 min, solid NaCl (10 g) is added and the mixture is stirred for 5 min. The flask contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the reaction flask is washed with EtOAc (100 mL), and the additional solution is added to the separatory funnel. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic phase is washed with 5 \u00b0C aqueous NaOH (1M, 100 mL) (Note 12) and then washed with brine (2 x 50 mL). The organic phase is dried by filtering through a bed of Na2SO4 (50 g) into a tared 1-L round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) to afford an orange oil (12.6 g), which is purified by column chromatography on Florisil (Notes 13 and 14) to afford 3-Oxocyclohex-1-enecarbonitrile (8.07 g, 63% yield) as a pale yellow oil spectrally identical to material previously reported (Note 15).3"

To a one-necked 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (5 cm x 7 mm) is added 2-amino-5-bromobenzoic acid (1) (9.87 g, 45.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and dry THF (400 mL) (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a septum and nitrogen inlet needle. The solution is cooled in an ice bath under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas. Lithium aluminum hydride (5.00 g, 132 mmol, 2.9 equiv) (Note 2) is added portion-wise (0.5 g portions) over the course of 1 h by temporarily removing the septum. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight with stirring (20 h). When the reaction is complete as determined by TLC (Note 3) the crude reaction mixture is poured slowly into ethyl acetate (400 mL) in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar cooled in an ice bath (Note 4). The excess LiAlH4 is quenched by the slow addition of water (50 mL) to the stirred mixture over 30 min. Additional water is added (450 mL) and the mixture is stirred until two distinct layers form (~30 min). The mixture is transferred to a 2 L separatory funnel and the layers separated. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2 x 500 mL) (Note 5). The combined organic layers are transferred to a 4 L separatory funnel, washed with brine (600 mL) and dried for 30 min over Na2SO4 (100 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg) to give a light yellow solid. Analytically pure material is obtained after recrystallization. Into a one-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm x 5 mm) the crude material is dissolved in a minimum amount of refluxing ethyl acetate (15 mL). Hexanes (~100 mL) is added over 10 min to the stirred and refluxing mixture until the product precipitates (Note 6). The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stored in the freezer at -15 \u00b0C for 3 h. The product is isolated by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with hexanes (50 mL), and dried by vacuum (0.01 mmHg, 23 \u00b0C) to provide a first crop (6.53-7.01 g). A second crop is obtained from the combined filtrates after removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation (25 \u00b0C, 30 mmHg). The resulting solids are dissolved in a one-necked, 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm x 5 mm) in a minimum amount of refluxing ethyl acetate (5 mL). To the refluxing, stirred solution is added hexanes (50 mL) over 10 min until precipitation begins. After cooling to room temperature the suspension is stored in a freezer at -15 \u00b0C overnight for collection of a second crop (0.91-1.09 g) by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel.

After the addition of N-methyl imidazole (NMI) (240 \u03bcL, 248 mg, 3.02 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 10), the dark red/brown reaction mixture is stirred open to air at 500 rpm (Note 11) at room temperature until the starting material is consumed as determined by TLC (2-3 h) (Note 3) (Note 12). Upon completion, the reaction mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate (300 mL), filtered through a plug of silica (Note 13), and washed with ethyl acetate (400 mL). The solvent is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 0.04 mmHg) to afford the crude aldehyde as a yellow brown solid (Note 14). Analytically pure material is obtained after purification by silica column chromatography. The solid is dissolved in a minimum amount of CHCl3 (20 mL) and loaded onto a column prepared from silica gel (150 g, Silicycle SiliaFlash\u00ae P60, 230-400 mesh) slurried in 10% EtOAc-hexanes (column dimensions: 5.5 cm diameter x 30 cm height, 18 cm packed height). Elution with 10% EtOAc-hexanes (200 mL initial collection followed by 30 mL fractions, 1.4 L total solvent volume eluted) affords the product in fractions 19-35. The product containing fractions are combined and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (0.1 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C). Subsequent drying at 0.01 mmHg (22 \u00b0C) provides aldehyde 3 in 89-91% yield (5.37-5.50 g) as a bright yellow powder (Note 15 and 16)."

            "A. Tetrabutylammonium(4-Fluorophenyl)trifluoroborate 3.   4-Fluorophenyl boronic acid 1 (4.00 g, 28.6 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 1) is placed in an open single-necked 1000-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and suspended in a mixture of chloroform (400 mL) (Note 2) and water (80 mL) (Note 3). Tetrabutylammonium bifluoride (TBABF) 2 (24.2 g, 85.8 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 4) is directly added to a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel and dissolved withH2O (120 mL). Open to air, the addition funnel is fitted to the reaction flask and the clear solution of tetrabutylammonium bifluoride 2 is added dropwise to the stirred boronic acid suspension over a period of 1 h (Note 5). Upon addition of the bifluoride solution, the boronic acid dissolves and the biphasic mixture becomes transparent. After 2.5 h (Note 6) the reaction mixture is transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel and the two layers are separated. The water layer is extracted with chloroform (4 x 100 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed with water (3 x 200 mL), brine (2 x 150 mL), and dried over anhydrous Magnesium sulfate (30 g, 1 h) (Note 7). Magnesium sulfate is removed by vacuum filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 8) and the filtrate is evaporated by rotary evaporation (bath temp 40 \u00b0C), with the final concentration in a 250-mL round bottom flask. The resulting clear transparent oil is placed under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) for 3 h to afford a white solid (14.5 g). The crude product is purified by recrystallization from ethanol/water (Note 9) as follows. The solid trifluoroborate in the 250-mL round-bottomed flask is dissolved in ethanol (9.0 mL) upon heating at 50 \u00b0C in a water bath. After cooling to 23 \u00b0C, water (4.0 mL) is added dropwise to the flask with swirling until the solution becomes cloudy and remains persistently cloudy. This solution is placed in a refrigerator at 0 \u00b0C for 3 h. A white solid precipitates from the mixture and is collected by gravity filtration (Note 10). Water (3 x 20 mL) is used to rinse residual solids from the 250 mL flask, and all the rinses are used to wash the solid, which is then dried under high vacuum (0.2 mmHg) over P2O5 (30 g) (15 h) to remove traces of ethanol and water, affording a white crystalline solid (11.2 g, 97%) (Note 11)."

The flask is immersed in a sodium chloride/ice bath (internal temperature -15 \u00b0C). Trichloroacetyl isocyanate (9.30 mL, 14.7 g, 78.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 4) is added slowly via a syringe through the rubber septum over a 10 min period at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below -10 \u00b0C. After stirring at -15 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 20 min (Note 5), methanol (0.90 mL, 0.71 g, 22 mmol, 0.30 equiv) (Note 6) is added via a syringe inserted through the rubber septum to quench excess trichloroacetyl isocyanate (Note 7). The solution is transferred to a 1-L recovery flask with the aid of dichloromethane (15 mL), and then concentrated by rotary evaporation (200 mmHg, water bath temperature 40 \u00b0C) and dried under vacuum (1.0 mmHg) (Note 8) to yield trichloroacetyl carbamate 2 as a pale yellow oil (25.9 g). The crude 2 in the 1-L recovery flask is dissolved in methanol (240 mL) (Note 6) and a magnetic stir bar (8 x 30 mm) is placed in the flask. Aqueous K2CO3 (2 M, 140 mL) is added to the stirred mixture in portions at room temperature over a 10 min period, resulting in formation of a cloudy solution (Note 9). After stirring at room temperature for 3 h while checking the consumption of trichloroacetyl carbamate 2 by TLC analysis (Note 5), the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (70 mmHg, water bath temperature 40 \u00b0C) to about half the original volume. The resulting cloudy solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 50 mL) (Note 10). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered through cotton. After removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation (70 mmHg, water bath temperature 40 \u00b0C), the oily residue is dried under vacuum (1.0 mmHg) (Note 8) to constant weight, affording crude carbamate 3 (13.93 g, 99%) (Note 11) as a white solid, which is used in Step B without further purification.",

The dropping funnel is rinsed with dry dichloromethane (5 mL). After stirring at -15 to -10 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 20 min (Note 16), the cooling bath is removed and the yellow reaction mixture is diluted with n-hexane (150 mL) (Note 17). After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, the light-brown solution is poured into aqueous KHSO4 (1 M, 300 mL) in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a stir bar (8 x 30 mm). The three-necked flask is rinsed with n-hexane (2 x 10 mL). After stirring vigorously for 30 min, the solution is transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel. The Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed with n-hexane (2 x 10 mL). The organic layer is separated, washed with water (200 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL) and brine (200 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered through cotton. Concentration by rotary evaporation (200 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) gives a crude mixture containing allyl isocyanate 5 and triphenylphosphine oxide as a yellow solid (72.8 g), to which is added n-hexane (200 mL). The resulting mixture is swirled in a sonicator for 5 min to form a suspension. After filtration through a pad of Celite (Note 18) and washing the filter cake with n-hexane (3 x 50 mL), the combined golden yellow filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (90 mmHg, water bath temperature 40 \u00b0C), and then dried under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 30 min to provide crude isocyanate 5 (25.4 g) as a pale yellow oil (Note 19 and Note 20).\nAn oven-dried 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar (8 x 30 mm), a thermometer with a Teflon holder, a 100-mL dropping funnel with a rubber septum, and an inlet adapter with a three-way stopcock fitted with an argon inlet is charged with dry tetrahydrofuran (280 mL) (Note 21) and tert-butyl alcohol (68.0 mL, 52.3 g, 711 mmol, 10.0 equiv) (Note 22).

The cooltetrahydrofuraning bath is removed and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The dropping funnel is quickly replaced with a 50-mL dropping funnel and the solution of lithium t-butoxide is cooled with a sodium chloride/ice bath (internal temperature -15 \u00b0C). A solution of crude 5 (25.4 g) in dry tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) is added through the dropping funnel over a 10 min period, keeping the internal temperature below -10 \u00b0C. After rinsing the dropping funnel with dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL), the reaction mixture is stirred below -10 \u00b0C for 20 min (Note 25).

The colorless solution of the carbodiimide is then stirred (700 rpm) at room temperature for approximately 20 min to allow dissolution, followed by immersion in an ice bath at 0 \u00b0C. Z-L-Phg-OH (7.26 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) and Oxyma Pure (3.67 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) are added to the cold solution of EDC-HCl as solids (Notes 4, 5 and 6). Two minutes after the addition of the reactants, H-Val-OMe-HCl (4.27 g, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) is added as a solid to the preactivated cocktail, followed by addition of DIEA (4.29 mL, 25 mmol, 1 equiv) using a 5-mL syringe (Note 7). The flask is then flushed with nitrogen and sealed with a polyethylene cap. The coupling cocktail is allowed to stir at 700 rpm in the ice bath for 1 h and then the reaction progresses at room temperature overnight. After 14-15 hours, the extent of peptide bond formation is monitored by TLC, showing trace amounts of starting acid and amine (Note 8). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 28 mmHg) (Note 9). The crude oily residue is diluted in AcOEt (500 mL) and transferred to a 1-L graduated separatory funnel (Note 10).

            "Di-tert-butylphosphinoferrocene.An oven-dried 1000-mL four-necked (one 34/45 joint and three 24/40 joints) round-bottomed flask is allowed to cool in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium sulfate. Once cool, the central joint is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, the glass rod of which is fitted with 7.2 x 2 cm Teflon paddle, coated with lubricant (Note 1) and sheathed by a 34/45 jointed glass stirrer bearing. The remaining three necks are fitted with a thermocouple in a 24/40 adapter, an argon line connected to a 24/40 adapter, and rubber septum. The rubber septum is removed from the fourth neck and the flask is charged with ferrocene (8.0 g, 43.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2). A 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a 24/40 joint is fitted in the fourth neck and the reaction set-up is flushed with argon for 5 min (see Note 3 for an image of the reaction setup). The top of the addition funnel is sealed with a rubber septum and the entire set-up is maintained under a positive pressure of argon throughout the remaining operations. Tetrahydrofuran (480 mL) (Note 4) is added via cannula through the rubber septum and down through the addition funnel resulting in an orange solution that is stirred at room temperature. A solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (1.0 M, 5.25 mL, 5.25 mmol, 0.12 equiv) (Note 5) is added to the flask through the rubber septum using a gastight syringe. The addition funnel is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) followed by pentane (10 mL) (Note 6). The reaction solution is cooled to about -73 \u00b0C by immersion of the flask in a dry ice-acetone bath. A solution of tert-Butyllithium (1.7 M, 49.6 mL, 84.3 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 7) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 10-15 min, keeping the internal temperature around -70 \u00b0C. The addition funnel is rinsed with pentane (10 mL) with a gastight syringe. A 2-3 \u00b0C exotherm is observed during the addition and an orange slurry forms toward the end or shortly after completion of the addition. The slurry is stirred at about -70 \u00b0C for 1 h and then the dry ice-acetone bath is replaced with an ice-water bath and the content of the flask is stirred and allowed to warm. Once the internal temperature reaches ca. 0 \u00b0C (Note 8), di-tert-butylchlorophosphine (8.8 mL, 46.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 9) is charged to the addition funnel via a gastight syringe and added to the reaction mixture drop-wise over 2-3 min. The addition funnel is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). The ice/water bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h. Reaction progress is monitored by TLC analysis (Note 10).\nTetrafluoroboric acid-diethyl ether complex (11.5 mL, 84.5 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 11) is added at ambient temperature to the reaction mixture via gastight syringe through the septum over ca. 5 min. A slight exotherm (5-7 \u00b0C) is observed as the solution becomes turbid. A solid begins to precipitate within 0.5-1 h. The suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a red thin suspension (Note 12). Deionized water (100 mL) and methyl tert-butyl ether (100 mL) are added via syringe through the septum and the resulting turbid homogeneous two-layer solution is stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. The mixture is then vacuum-filtered through a 1 cm pad of Celite (ca. 30 g) in a 300-mL fritted B\u00fcchner funnel with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg. The filter pad is rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) and the rinse combined with the filtrate. The filtrate is transferred to a flask and concentrated via rotary evaporation (Note 13) until all organics are removed and a red solid as a suspension in ca. 100 mL water is obtained. The suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h and vacuum-filtered using a 100-mL fritted B\u00fcchner funnel, fitted with a VWR brand No. 5 filter paper (55 mm), and with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg. The filter cake is washed with water (40 mL) and dried on the frit for 1 h using house-vacuum to obtain the crude product as an orange solid (Note 14).\nA 250-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask with 24/40 joints is equipped with a 5 cm magnetic stirbar, thermocouple in one neck, a 60 mL 24/40 joint pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is capped with a rubber septum in the center neck and an argon line connected to a 24/40 adapter in the third neck. The flask is charged with crude 1 and a 16-gauge needle is used to puncture the rubber septum attached to the addition funnel, allowing the flask to be flushed with argon for 5 min. Methyl tert-butyl ether (50 mL) is added via gastight syringe to the reaction flask via the addition funnel. The suspension is heated with stirring to 50-55 \u00b0C via an oil bath and, once the internal temperature reaches 50 \u00b0C, methanol (50 mL) is added via gastight syringe to the addition funnel and then to the mixture drop-wise over 5 min. The mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C for an additional 10-15 min to obtain a dark red solution. The solution is vacuum-filtered (with a vacuum pressure of ca. 15 mmHg) through a B\u00fcchner funnel with #1 filter paper into a pre-warmed 500-mL 24/40 joint round-bottomed flask (Note 15) that contains a 7 cm magnetic stirbar. The B\u00fcchner funnel is replaced with a 125 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is charged with methyl tert-butyl ether (100 mL) and an argon line is attached to the top of the addition funnel. The methyl tert-butyl ether in the addition funnel is added dropwise over 5-10 min, which results in the formation of a slurry. The oil bath is removed and the slurry stirred at ambient temperature for 3 h. The slurry is filtered on a B\u00fcchner medium-fritted funnel and the cake is washed with tert-Butyl methyl ether (40 mL). The filter cake is dried using house-vacuum to obtain 1 (11.0 g, 61%) as a light orange solid (Notes 16)."

A 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) is equipped with a reflux condenser and two rubber septa (Note 1). The top of the condenser is fitted with a stopcock connected to a vacuum line with an argon flow. Magnesium turnings (7.2 g, 0.3 mol, 1.2 equiv) are added and the apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum. After cooling to room temperature under an argon purge, the flask is charged with diethyl ether (100 mL) and equipped with a thermometer. 1,2-Dibromoethane (0.5 mL) (Note 2) is added to initiate the reaction with a slight increase of the internal temperature (2-3 \u00b0C). Benzyl bromide (30 mL, 0.25 mol) (Note 2) is injected into the mixture with a syringe pump at a rate so as to maintain a gentle reflux (15 mL/h). After the addition, the mixture is heated under reflux with an oil bath (oil bath temperature, 55 \u00b0C) for another 2 h. Another 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) (Note 1) is fitted with two rubber stoppers and a 250-mL pressure equalizing addition funnel. The flask and funnel are flame-dried under vacuum. After cooling to room temperature under an argon purge, propargyl bromide (33.4 mL of an 80 wt. % solution in toluene, 0.3 mol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 2) and diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 2) are added and the flask is fitted with a thermometer. The mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with an ice-salt bath. The prepared Grignard reagent is transferred to the addition funnel using an 18-gauge cannula and added to the propargyl bromide over 3 h. After the addition, the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 2 h at 0 \u00b0C (Note 3). Then the mixture is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a cold saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (200 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is back-extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL x 2) (Note 2). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C water bath). Purification is performed by vacuum distillation (70-80 \u00b0C/23 mmHg, fractionating column: 2 cm diameter x 15 cm length) to afford 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene(1) (18.6 g, 57% by the checker; 24.9 g, 77% by the submitter, see discussion) as a colorless liquid (Note 4).",

A 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, the top of which is fitted with a stopcock connected to a vacuum line with an argon flow. The other two necks are fitted with rubber septa. After evacuating and backfilling with argon the flask is charged with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter), Rh2(OAc)4 (180 mg, 0.4 mmol, 0.008 equiv) (Note 5), 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene (1) (19.5 g, 150 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 6) and CH2Cl2 (40 mL) (Note 2) under argon. The mixture is heated to reflux using an oil bath (55 \u00b0C, external temperature) and after 5 min at reflux, a solution of ethyl \u03b1-diazoacetoacetate2 (7.8 g, 50 mmol, 1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) is added using a syringe pump (10 mL/h). Upon completion of the addition, an additional quantity of Rh2(OAc)4 (40 mg, 0.1 mmol, 0.002 equiv) (Note 7) is added and the resulting mixture is refluxed for 2 h; the progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 3). Upon completion, the reaction is cooled to room temperature and concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 35 \u00b0C water bath). The residue is purified by column chromatography (column \u2205 = 80 mm with 300 g of silica gel (230-400 mesh); ~150 mL fractions; n-hexane (1.5 L) (Note 2) is used to recover 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene 1 (fractions 5-12, 7.64 g, 39%); then a mixture of 3:1 n-hexane:ethyl acetate (Note 2) (2 L) is used to elute 1-acetyl-2-phenethylidene- cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester 2 (fractions 20-25, 15.1 g ) (Note 8).",

After applying vacuum followed by flushing with argon, the stirred mixture is treated with Ti(OEt)4 (21.3 mL, 22.8 g, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2), added by syringe. At this point, the reaction shows an intense yellow color. The rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper, and the stirred (700 rpm) mixture is heated so as to maintain the temperature of the oil bath at 72 \u00b0C for 4 h (Note 3), during which period its color changes to orange. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL), and then transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a mixture of ethyl acetate :brine (25 mL:25 mL). The resulting pale yellow suspension is filtered through a short plug of Celite (Note 4), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 1000 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford crude imine 3 as a yellow oil (Note 5). The crude material is purified by flash column chromatography (24 x 4.5 cm column containing 160 g of silica gel) (Note 6). A mixture of hexanes:ethyl acetate is used as the eluent, with a gradient of polarity as follows: hexanes:ethyl acetate 100:0 (about 500 mL), 20:1 (about 300 mL), 15:1 (about 300 mL), 9:1 (about 600 mL), 3:2 (about 300 mL), and finally 1:1 until no more product elutes (about 300 mL) (Notes 7 and 8). Fractions containing pure product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the resultant product is then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford imine 3 (9.54-9.78 g, 85-88% yield) as a yellow solid (Notes 9 and 10).",

After applying vacuum and flushing with argon, the flask is charged with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (490 mg, 0.8 mmol, 0.025 equiv), 2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol (143 mg, 1.6 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and 4 \u00c5 MS (3 g) while maintaining a positive pressure of argon (Notes 11 and 12). The system is again evacuated and filled with argon [5 cycles vacuum (6 seconds), then argon], and a positive pressure of argon is maintained throughout the remainder of the experiment. Dry isopropyl alcohol (25 mL) is added using a syringe (Note 13) and the rubber septum is replaced by a glass stopper. The stirred (450 rpm) reaction mixture is then placed in a preheated oil bath (bath temperature 86 \u00b0C) for 25 min, resulting in a color change to cherry-red (Note 14). The oil-bath is replaced with a water-bath (preheated to 50 \u00b0C) and heating is adjusted to maintain the temperature at about 50 \u00b0C (Note 15). After replacing the glass stopper with a rubber septum, a previously prepared solution of imine 3 (7.147 g, 32.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (160 mL) under argon is added to the reaction mixture using a cannula (over about 10 min), and the stirring speed is increased to 600 rpm. The temperature of the system is allowed to stabilize at 50 \u00b0C over approximately 5 minutes, then a previously prepared solution of potassium tert-butoxide (449 mg, 4.0 mmol, 0.125 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (40 mL) is added to the reaction mixture using a syringe (Note 16). The resulting brownish mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C (external temperature) for 2 h (Note 17). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath for 15 min, then filtered through a short plug of silica gel (Note 18), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 600 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). In order to ensure the removal of the ruthenium complex, solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the residue is dissolved in 40 mL of ethyl acetate and passed through a short plug of silica gel (Note 19), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 500 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford pure sulfinamide 4 (7.20-7.22 g, >99% yield) as a brown oil (Notes 20 , 21 and 22).",

Distilled H2O (20 mL), acetone (30 mL), and NaHCO3 (24 g, 0.285 mol) are combined in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and chilled in an ice/water bath with magnetic stirring (oblong stirbar, 3 cm x 1 cm x 1.5 cm) for 20 min (Note 1). After 20 min, stirring is halted and Oxone (25 g, 0.0406 mol) is added in a single portion (Note 2). The flask is loosely covered and the slurry is stirred vigorously for 15 min while still submerged in the ice bath. After 15 min, the stir bar is removed from the reaction flask and rinsed with a small portion of distilled water.\nThe flask containing the reaction slurry is then attached to a rotary evaporator with the bath at room temperature. The bump bulb (250 mL) (Note 3) is chilled in a dry ice/acetone bath and a vacuum of 155 mmHg is applied via a benchtop diaphragm pump and an accompanied in-line vacuum regulator. During this process, the flask is rotated vigorously (210 rpm) to prevent bumping of the slurry into the bump trap (Note 4). After 15 min, the bath temperature is raised to 40 \u00b0C over the course of 10 min. When the bath reaches 40 \u00b0C, the distillation is halted immediately via releasing the vacuum and raising the flask from the heated water bath.\nThe pale yellow acetone solution of DMDO is decanted from the bump bulb directly into a graduated cylinder to measure the total volume of the solution (an average of 25 mL) and then the solution is dried over Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 is removed by filtration and rinsed with 10 mL of acetone. Titration of the obtained DMDO solution is then performed according to the procedure of Adam, et al.2 (Note 5). Results consistently show 2.1-2.3 mmol total DMDO in the solution, giving a final concentration typically in the range of 60-65 mM (Note 6). The DMDO solution was used immediately following titration."

The contents are cooled to \u201310 \u00b0C by means of a Dewar filled with isopropanol and an immersion cooler (Neslab CC 100) (Note 3), then 100% formic acid (21.1 mL, 25.8 g, 560 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added in portions to the flask over 3 min via a measuring cylinder [Caution: exotherm from \u201310 \u00b0C to 1 \u00b0C]. The resulting colorless reaction mixture is then heated in an oil bath on a hot plate to 43 \u00b0C (internal temperature) over 25 min. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 h (42\u201344 \u00b0C, internal temperature) and monitored by 1H NMR analysis (Note 5).\n1H NMR analysis of crude reaction aliquots is employed to determine the quantity of acetic formic anhydride in the reaction mixture (18.1 g, 206 mmol). Formic anhydride (2.4 g, 32 mmol) was also present (Notes 6 and 7). The crude anhydride mixture is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C over 30 min using an ice bath. While maintaining a positive pressure of argon, the Vigreux condenser is removed and replaced with a rubber septum with an argon inlet.\nA 500-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, an internal thermometer, and a rubber septum with an argon inlet, is charged with benzotriazole (23.8 g, 200 mmol, 0.84 equiv relative to formylating agents (Notes 6 and 8). Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) is added to the benzotriazole via a measuring cylinder and the resulting light yellow solution is cooled to \u201315 \u00b0C (internal temperature) over 20 min by means of an ice/salt water bath. The crude mixed anhydride is then added to the benzotriazole solution via cannula over 12 min, ensuring that the internal temperature does not exceed \u20135 \u00b0C (Note 9). Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture is cooled to \u201315 \u00b0C (internal temperature) by means of a Dewar filled with isopropanol and an immersion cooler (Neslab CC 100) (Note 3) and vigorously stirred until completion by TLC analysis (2 h) (Note 10), at which point the reaction mixture is thick and cream colored.\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a single-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated to dryness by rotatory evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 20 mmHg). Chloroform (50 mL) (Notes 11 and 12) is added to the flask and the solution is concentrated again (40 \u00b0C bath temperature, 20 mmHg). The dilution and concentration procedure is repeated 3 times, yielding a white solid. The solid is dried at room temperature, under 0.75 mmHg for 12 h. The white solid is ground with a glass rod and dried at room temperature, under 0.75 mmHg for a further 48 h to afford 29.3 g (99.7%) of N-formylbenzotriazole (Notes 13, 14, and 15)."
