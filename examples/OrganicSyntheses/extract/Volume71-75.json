N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (9 mL) (Note 5) is introduced with a hypodermic syringe under a stream of argon and the inlet is sealed by a glass stopper using silicon grease. The suspension is stirred at 100\u00b0C for 10 min under argon (Note 6), giving a clear reddish brown solution (Note 7). The reaction mixture is cooled and concentrated at 1 mm at 50\u00b0C with vigorous stirring and then at 0.1 mm for 1 hr to give 500 mg of (R)-BINAP-Ru(II) complex (Note 8) as a reddish brown solid, which is used as the hydrogenation catalyst.",

To this mixture is added the in situ prepared (R)-BINAP-Ru(II) complex (175 mg) (Note 11) under a stream of argon. The resulting yellowish orange solution (Note 12) is further degassed by two freeze-thaw cycles and then transferred by cannula to a dry, argon-filled, 500-mL glass autoclave equipped with a gas inlet tube, a septa-covered stop valve, and pressure gauge (Note 13). The gas inlet tube is attached to a hydrogen source (Note 14) and the air originally present in this tube and the autoclave is replaced by evacuation (to ca. 20 mm) and refilling with hydrogen five times. Hydrogen is introduced into the reaction vessel until the pressure gauge indicates 3 atm. The pressure is carefully released to 1 atm by opening the stop valve. This procedure is repeated three times, and finally hydrogen is pressurized to 4 atm (Note 15). The yellowish orange solution is vigorously stirred at 100\u00b0C for 6 hr during which time the hydrogen cylinder is kept connected. After the main valve of the hydrogen cylinder is closed, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, excess hydrogen is carefully bled off, and the apparatus is disassembled. The deep reddish orange contents (Note 16) are placed in a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, and the glass autoclave is rinsed with three 20-mL portions of dichloromethane. The solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator, and the residue (Note 17) is distilled to give 47\u201349 g (92\u201396% yield) of (R)-(\u2212)-methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate in 97\u201398% ee as a fraction boiling at 40\u00b0C, 2 mm (Note 18)."

The solid residue is then washed with hexane (5 mL \u00d7 2) and recrystallized from hexane (10 mL). Recrystallization is carried out in the same flask by heating the solution to reflux and then leaving it at room temperature overnight. Again the supernatant liquid is removed with a syringe and the crystalline residue is vacuum dried to give 5.7 g (44%) of yellow, highly moisture sensitive product.

A 2-L, round-bottomed flask is charged with 50 g (0.58 mol) of poly-[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid] (PHB) (Note 1) and 500 mL of absolute 1,2-dichloroethane. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr. A solution of 10 mL of concd sulfuric acid in 200 mL of absolute methanol is added and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 3 days. During this time the mixture becomes homogeneous.\nAfter the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of half-saturated brine is added to the reaction mixture, which is stirred for 10 min before the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted three times with 200 mL each of chloroform. The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of brine, 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 mL of brine. After the solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and removed in a rotary evaporator, a residue of 59 g is isolated.\nThis crude product is distilled under reduced pressure to give 48 g (70%) of pure (R)-(\u2212)-methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate (bp 61\u201362\u00b0/18 mm) with a specific rotation of [\u03b1]DRT \u221247.6\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 1.0) (Note 2).",
            "B. (R)-(\u2212)-3-Hydroxybutanoic acid. In a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a precision-ground stirrer and a coil condenser bearing a distillation bridge, are placed 200 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane and 50 g (0.58 mol) of PHB (Note 1). The mixture is stirred and heated at 150\u00b0C until a milky solution is formed (Note 3). p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (2.5 g, 0.013 mol) is added and the solution heated an additional 30 min at 150\u00b0C. A total amount of 9.3 g (11.8 mL, 0.29 mol) of methanol is then added carefully through the condenser to the boiling solution in approx 1-mL portions (Note 4). The light brown, cloudy solution is heated at reflux (oil bath, 140\u00b0C) for another 48 hr (Note 5). The oil bath temperature is reduced to 130\u00b0C and 60 mL of water is carefully added. The resulting two-phase mixture is heated for another 4 hr (Note 6). Methanol, 1,2-dichloroethane, and approx 150 mL of water are removed by distillation through the condenser within 1\u20132 hr (Note 7). During the distillation nine 30-mL portions of water are added; the resulting homogeneous aqueous solution is heated at reflux for another 4 hr. During this period the temperature of the oil bath is increased to 180\u00b0C. Methanol/water (50 mL) is removed by distillation and, after the addition of 50 mL of water (Note 8), the solution is again heated at reflux for 15 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 30\u00b0C, followed by the addition of 0.6 g (0.015 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 10 mL of water. Water is first removed in a rotary evaporator at a maximum temperature of 30\u00b0C, 15 mm, followed by drying at 0.1 mm (Note 9). The residue is dissolved in 250 mL of ether, the solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated in a rotary evaporator and dried at 0.1 mm. The resulting light-brown clear oil (Note 10) is distilled at 80\u2013100\u00b0C (air bath)/10\u22123mm by bulb to bulb distillation (Note 11). The crude product is either crystalline or a colorless oil that crystallizes upon standing at room temperature. After the crystals are crushed in a mortar, they are dried for 2 days in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) (Note 12), to yield 32 g (53%) of (R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid, mp 44\u201346\u00b0C, [\u03b1]DRT \u221224.7\u00b0 (H2O, c 5.0 (Note 13), (Note 14), (Note 15)."

The mildly exothermic reaction is controlled by gently swirling the flask in an ice bath as required (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser topped by a calcium chloride (CaCl2) drying tube, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux (using an oil bath at 125\u00b0C) for 12 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the volatile material is removed by distillation using a bath temperature of 50\u00b0C under aspirator vacuum with the distillate boiling at 30\u201335\u00b0C (Note 4). The residual liquid is then added to a mechanically-stirred mixture of ice (2 kg) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 125 ml), and stirring is continued until all the ice has melted.

The resulting brown liquid is slowly poured into 1.5 L of water. After standing for 8 hr, the precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration and air dried. The solid is dissolved in 500 mL of acetonitrile, the resulting solution is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, and is washed with three 300-mL portions of hexanes. The acetonitrile layer is concentrated to provide 24 g of crude product as a brown solid.\nThe crude product is dissolved in a minimum amount of dichloromethane and adsorbed onto 25 g of silica gel (32\u201363 micron) by subsequent evaporation of the dichloromethane under reduced pressure. The sample of dry, dark brown silica gel is added to the top of a column containing 500 g of silica gel (32\u201363 micron) with a mobile phase of hexanes. The polarity of the mobile phase is gradually increased from hexanes to 95:5 hexanes-ethyl acetate. The fractions containing the desired product (Rf = 0.26, 95:5 hexanes-ethyl acetate) are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 6.9 g of 3 as a yellow solid. Additional purification is required to remove traces of tin by-products. Compound 3 is dissolved in 70 mL of ethyl acetate and stirred over 70 mL of saturated, aqueous potassium fluoride for 24 hr. The two phases are separated and the organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow solid is recrystallized from ethyl alcohol to provide 6.1 g (48%, 2 crops) of 3 as yellow needles (Note 17), (Note 18), and (Note 19)."

            "A. 2-(2,3-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline. To a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser and placed in an ice-water bath, is added 24.5 g (0.206 mol) of thionyl chloride (Note 1). To this is added 12.2 g (0.067 mol) of 2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid (Note 2). The resulting mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr and then at room temperature for 24 hr. Excess thionyl chloride is removed by rotary evaporation (HOOD!) and the residue is distilled using a Kugelrohr apparatus at 105\u00b0C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7\u201313.1 g of 2,3-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride, which crystallizes on cooling (Note 3).\nThe acid chloride, 12.7 g, is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and transferred to a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (12.5 g, 0.140 mol) dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the cold solution over 15 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for 2 hr. The white precipitate (Note 4) is removed by filtration and the mother liquor is removed by rotary evaporation to afford 15.7 g of the amido alcohol (Note 5). The amido alcohol is redissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane and added to a 300-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar. Thionyl chloride (24.5 g, 0.206 mol) is added dropwise and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr (Note 6). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C (ice-water bath) and to it is added slowly 50 mL of cold water followed by approximately 50 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide solution, which basifies the reaction mixture to approximately pH 11. Saturated sodium chloride solution (approximately 50 mL) is added and the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The lower phase (CH2Cl2 solution) is removed and set aside while the upper, aqueous phase is extracted once with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solution is then filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave crude 2-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (1). The latter is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 110\u00b0C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7\u201313.3 g (81\u201385%) (Note 7).",
            "B. 2,2'-Dimethoxy-6-(4\",4\"-dimethyloxazolinyl)biphenyl. Magnesium turnings (3.3 g, 0.14 g-atom, (Note 8)) and 100 mL of dry ether (Note 9) are added to a flame-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is fitted with a 250-mL addition funnel, reflux condenser, and magnetic stirring bar, and placed under a slow nitrogen flow. A few crystals of iodine are added to the reaction vessel followed by dropwise addition of 18 g (0.12 mol) of 2-bromoanisole (Note 10) in 150 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 11). When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. When it is apparent that formation of the Grignard solution has consumed most of the magnesium turnings, a solution of the dimethoxyphenyloxazoline, 11.2 g (0.048 mol) in 300 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 12), is added dropwise at room temperature to the stirred Grignard solution. After addition is complete, stirring of the dark solution is continued for 24 hr or until reaction is complete (Note 13). The reaction mixture is quenched by careful addition of saturated ammonium chloride (50 mL) followed by addition of 50 mL of water. The contents are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the lower aqueous phase is separated while the upper organic phase is set aside. The aqueous phase is returned to the separatory funnel and extracted once with 50 mL of ether; both ethereal phases are then combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. There is obtained 19.2 g of a yellow solid that contains, in addition to the biphenyl, some anisole and other contaminants (e.g., starting materials). The volatile impurities are removed by Kugelrohr or other short path distillation (105\u00b0C, 0.05 mm, 15 min) to leave 14.2 g (96%) of crude biphenyl product. Purification is performed by recrystallization from ethyl acetate-hexane (1:1) to give 12.2\u201313.0 g (80\u201385%) of pure material (Note 14), (Note 15).",
            "C. 2,2'-Dimethoxy-6-formylbiphenyl. To a flame-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, under nitrogen, and fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is added 12.2 g (0.039 mol) of pure biphenyloxazoline 2 in 300 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 16). To this is added 7.9 g (0.048 mol) of methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (Note 17) and the chilled solution is stirred at room temperature for 2\u20133 hr (Note 18). The solution of quaternized oxazoline is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath. Separately, 3.3 g (0.87 mol) of sodium borohydride is slurried at 0\u00b0C with 125 mL of absolute ethanol. The chilled slurry is added slowly, to control foaming, to the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 45 min and the contents of the flask are evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid residue is dissolved in 400 mL of 4:1 tetrahydrofuran-water and 19.5 g (0.217 mol) of oxalic acid is added in portions (exotherm). The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 16\u201318 hr (Note 19). Tetrahydrofuran is removed under rotary evaporation to leave behind an aqueous slurry that is washed in a separatory funnel with pentane-ether (1:1, 2 \u00d7 100 mL). The upper layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted again with 50 mL of pentane-ether. The organic layers are combined and washed with 50 mL of aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate and then with 50 mL of saturated brine. The aqueous washes are also back-extracted with pentane-ether which is combined with the other organic solutions. The organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate (anhydrous) and the solution is filtered through Celite. Concentration of the solution under reduced pressure gives 7.5 g (75\u201383%) of the final biphenyl aldehyde, mp 65\u201367\u00b0C. Recrystallization from 2-propanol gives 6.5 g of pure material (Note 20), (Note 21)."

After the temperature of the solution falls below 15\u00b0C, 13.4 mL (0.120 mol) of 1-chloro-3-methyl-2-butene (Note 3) in 50 mL of THF is added dropwise over 30\u201360 min while maintaining the temperature at less than 20\u00b0C (Note 4) under sonication at an output power of 30\u201375W (Note 5). After the addition is complete, sonication is continued for a further 30\u201345 min (Note 6) to complete the reaction.

The flask is charged with 5.00 g (27.4 mmol) of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Note 1) as a solid followed by 100 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 2) via syringe. The addition funnel is charged with 11.8 g (32.9 mmol) of tributyl(3-methyl-2-butenyl)tin (Note 3) in 100 mL of dry dichloromethane. The flask is immersed in an acetone/dry ice bath, the solution cooled to \u221278\u00b0C, and 10.1 mL (82.3 mmol) of boron trifluoride etherate (Note 4) is added dropwise from a syringe. Next, the stannane solution is added dropwise over a 30-min period. Following completion of the addition, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. At \u221240\u00b0C, the color of the solution turns from deep red to yellow. When the reaction mixture reaches 0\u00b0C, it is treated with 100 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid, stirred for 5 min, and allowed to stand. The aqueous phase that separates is washed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and the combined organic layers are washed with water (2 \u00d7 20 mL) and brine (2 \u00d7 20 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated. The residual yellow oil is dissolved in 200 mL of ether and this solution is added to 37.1 g (137 mmol) of ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3 \u00b7 6 H2O) in 200 mL of water in a 500-mL conical flask. The resulting mixture is stirred for 8 hr at room temperature. The layers are then separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL), and the combined organic solutions are stirred with 100 mL of 10% aqueous potassium fluoride for 2 hr (Note 5). The insoluble tin salts are separated by filtration (Note 6). The organic phase in the filtrate is washed with water (3 \u00d7 20 mL) and brine (3 \u00d7 20 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to give a deep red oil, that is purified by column chromatography (Note 7). The red-orange band is collected (1600\u20133000 mL) to give 6.15 g (90%) of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-1,4-benzoquinone as a deep red oil (Note 8)."

            "A. Preparation of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP). An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet, and septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and charged via syringe with 40.5 mL (33.9 g, 0.240 mol) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (Note 1) and 250 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The rapidly stirred solution is cooled with an ice bath and 88.0 mL (0.220 mol) of 2.5 M butyllithium in hexanes (Note 3) is added via syringe over a 20-min period. This solution of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide is stirred with continued ice bath cooling for a period of about 30 min while the next reaction is readied.",
            "B. In situ lithiodibromomethane preparation/addition. An oven-dried, 2-L, round-bottomed flask with three vertical necks, containing 20.0 g (0.100 mol) of ethyl 1-naphthoate (Note 4), is equipped with a 2-1/2 \u00d7 \u00be-inch, egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar (Note 5), a \u2212100\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C thermometer (Note 6) and a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using a nitrogen bubbler system that allows pressure release. The flask is charged through the septum (via syringe) with 200 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 15.5 mL (38.3 g, 0.220 mol) of dibromomethane (Note 1). The thermometer (in a side neck) is adjusted so that the bulb is submerged when the liquid is stirred. The flask is immersed almost to the necks in a dry ice-acetone bath using about 2 L of acetone, and the contents are stirred vigorously for good heat transfer.\nThe lithium tetramethylpiperidide solution from Part A is cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath. When the solution of ethyl 1-naphthoate and dibromomethane has cooled to \u221274\u00b0C or below (internal solution temperature), addition of the dry ice-acetone cooled solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide is begun. Addition is made via a double-ended (16 gauge) needle over a 40 to 50-min period using a slight positive nitrogen pressure in the 500-mL flask (Note 7). During this time, the addition rate is slowed or stopped as needed to maintain the reaction temperature below \u221267\u00b0C.",
            "C. Preparation of lithium hexamethyldisilazide(LiHMDS)/lithium ethoxide. As the addition of Part B above is progressing, an oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet, and septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and charged via syringe with 42.1 mL (32.2 g, 0.200 mol) of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (Note 1), 5.9 mL (4.6 g, 0.100 mol) of absolute ethanol, and 160 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The rapidly stirred solution is cooled with an ice bath and 120 mL (0.300 mol) of 2.5 M butyllithium in hexanes is added via syringe over a 20-min period. The resulting solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide and lithium ethoxide is stirred with continued cooling for a period of about 30 min and is then cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 8).",
            "D. Base and butyllithium addition. Ten minutes after the addition of lithium tetramethylpiperidide to the main reaction is complete, the cold (ca. \u221270\u00b0C) solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide and lithium ethoxide is added (via a double-ended needle) over a 15 to 20-min period, while maintaining the reaction mixture temperature below \u221265\u00b0C. Five minutes after the addition is complete, the dry ice-acetone cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm. When the internal temperature of the solution has reached \u221220\u00b0C (after about 15 min), the reaction mixture is again cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 9), (Note 10). When the internal reaction temperature has reached \u221270\u00b0C or below, 308 mL (0.400 mol) of 1.3 M sec-butyllithium in cyclohexane (Note 11) is added via syringe over a 30 to 40-min period so that the internal temperature is maintained below \u221260\u00b0C. Five minutes after the addition is complete, the dry ice-acetone cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm. After the internal temperature has gradually reached ca. \u221210\u00b0C (Note 12), the reaction mixture is warmed to 20\u00b0C with a ~25\u00b0C water bath. A solution of butyllithium (80 mL, 0.200 mol) in hexanes is then added using a syringe pump over a 30 to 40-min period while the internal temperature is maintained between 20\u201325\u00b0C (Note 13), (Note 14). The reaction mixture is then allowed to stir for 30 min at room temperature (Note 15).",
            "E. Quench and purification. While the butyllithium addition is taking place, an acidic ethanol quench solution is prepared in a 3-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 1 L of absolute ethanol and the funnel with 250 mL of acetyl chloride. The ethanol is stirred rapidly and the flask is cooled with an ice bath as the acetyl chloride is added over a 30\u201340-min period and then the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 20\u201330 min. After the main reaction mixture has been stirred for 30 min at room temperature, it is cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath. The acidic ethanol solution is cooled with an ice bath and the cold, main reaction mixture is quenched by addition (via a double-ended needle) into the rapidly stirred, cold, acidic ethanol solution over a 3 to 3.5 hr period (Note 16).\nAfter the quench is complete, the mixture is diluted with 2 L of ether and washed in a separatory funnel with 1.25 L of aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is reextracted with a 2-L portion of ether. The combined ethereal layers are washed with 1.25 L of saturated brine solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and removal of solvent using a rotary evaporator there remains 26 g of crude product as a reddish-brown oil. Distillation of this material under reduced pressure through an unpacked, 2-inch distillation apparatus affords 17.3 g (81%) of ethyl 1-naphthylacetate as a yellow liquid, (bp 134\u2013138\u00b0C, 0.2 mm) (Note 17), (Note 18)."

            "A. 1-(2-Methylallyl)-2-(trimethylsiloxy)methylenecyclododecanol. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask connected to a nitrogen bubbler and equipped with a mechanical stirrer with ground glass shaft and bearing a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a septum inlet is charged with 45.4 g (1.89 mol) of magnesium turnings (Note 1) and flushed for 5 min with nitrogen. Anhydrous ether, 450 mL, (Note 2) is added and the flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. Methallyl chloride, 64.6 mL (0.65 mol, (Note 3)) is added dropwise from the addition funnel to the stirred magnesium turnings during 45 min. (Caution! The reaction is exothermic and care must be exercised to add the methallyl chloride at a moderate rate with adequate stirring and cooling of the reaction mixture). During this time the reaction mixture turns to a gray heterogeneous slurry. Stirring is continued at 0\u00b0C for 1.5 hr and at 22\u00b0C for 1.5 hr.\nIn a separate, dry, 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted to a nitrogen bubbler and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a septum inlet is added a solution of 12.6 g (60.0 mmol) of 2-(hydroxymethylene)cyclododecanone (Note 4) in 500 mL of anhydrous ether. The stirred ethereal solution of the hydroxymethylene ketone is treated at 22\u00b0C with 33 mL of a freshly prepared mixture (1/1, v/v) of chlorotrimethylsilane and triethylamine (Note 5). An immediate reaction takes place with deposition of a white precipitate. The mixture is stirred thoroughly at 22\u00b0C for 15 min to insure complete conversion to the silyl enol ether.\nThe heterogeneous mixture of the silyl enol ether and triethylamine hydrochloride is transferred to the solution of the Grignard reagent at 0\u00b0C by means of a large-bore cannula (Note 6) during 15 min. The efficient transfer of the silyl enol ether is accomplished with the aid of nitrogen pressure. The flask containing the silyl enol ether is rinsed with 50 mL of ether that is transferred to the Grignard solution. Stirring at 0\u00b0C is continued for 15 min. The reaction is then quenched by slow addition of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution until the reaction mixture becomes clear. (Caution! The septa are removed from the flask in order to vent the pressure). The solution is allowed to warm to 22\u00b0C and the ether layer is decanted from the magnesium salt and the unreacted magnesium. The residue is diluted with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with brine (2 \u00d7 50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure. The product that is obtained is used in the next step without purification.",

The flask is charged with 200 mL of toluene (Note 7) and 4.6 g (24 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.). The solution is warmed to 80\u00b0C in a heating mantle. Tertiary alcohol 1 from the preceding step is dissolved in 150 mL of toluene and transferred to the flask by cannula. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by silica gel TLC eluting with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane (Note 8). After 3 hr the reaction mixture is cooled to 22\u00b0C and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (4 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvents are removed under reduced pressure and the residue is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane. The benzoannelated product is obtained as a pale yellow oil in 86% overall yield (12 g; (Note 9))."

An argon atmosphere is established in the reaction flask by repeated cycles of evacuation and refilling with argon. Through use of a syringe, 210 mL of dry dichloromethane is added to the reaction flask. Under a positive argon stream, one rubber septum is replaced by a thermometer (\u2212110\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C) and the other rubber septum is replaced by an argon-flushed, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel sealed with a rubber septum and charged with a solution of 3 (25.5 g, 95.0 mmol) in 40 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 1). The reaction flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and the solution of 3 in dichloromethane is added dropwise over a period of 30\u201345 min with stirring at this temperature.

The combined organic layers are washed with water (100 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), and brine (100 mL), then dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the viscous, colored residue (111 g) is subjected to bulb-to-bulb distillation using 500-mL and 250-mL collector bulbs and a 500-mL flask to hold the crude product. The oven temperature is initially 20\u00b0C and is gradually increased to 120\u00b0C. Pressure is maintained at 0.25 mm. Initially only the bulb remote from the oven is cooled, using an acetone/dry ice bath. Solvent and volatile impurities are collected in this bulb.

The mixture is heated to 90\u00b0C and maintained with vigorous stirring for 20 hr. After the black suspension is cooled to room temperature, 1 L of water is added and the mixture is filtered over Celite (Note 3). The solution is divided into two halves and each is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 1.5 L). Each organic extract is washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (500 mL) and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The combined, crude, black oil is subjected to bulb-to-bulb distillation (20\u2013110\u00b0C at 0.05 mm) with dry ice cooling. The resulting light brown liquid is fractionally redistilled (62\u201365\u00b0C at 0.25 mm) to give 147 g (50%) of tropone as a pale yellow oil (Note 4).",

Chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 4), 64.3 g (0.592 mol) and 36.0 g (0.500 mol) of freshly distilled isobutyraldehyde are added sequentially to this stirred mixture via the dropping funnel at room temperature. Under vigorous stirring the resulting mixture is heated to 120\u00b0C (oil bath temperature) for 8 hr, then cooled to room temperature and poured into 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution. The mixture is extracted with three 200-mL portions of pentane, the combined organic phases are washed four times with 60 mL of ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid (Note 5) and finally with 100 mL of saturated NaHCO3 solution, dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and the pentane is removed at atmospheric pressure to provide crude product (80 g). This material is carefully distilled at atmospheric pressure through a column packed with glass beads (30 cm).

After a short induction period, vigorous nitrogen evolution is observed and the suspension turns from blue to brownish-yellow. Addition of the diazo compound is regulated so that continuous liberation of nitrogen is observed at the gas bubbler. After the resulting black-brown suspension is cooled to room temperature, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (bath temperature below 35\u00b0C). The residue is treated with 50 g of alumina (Note 11) and 100 mL of pentane; the slurry is filtered and placed on a column that contains 200 g of alumina. Elution with pentane is accelerated by applying a slight pressure of nitrogen at the top of the column.

            "A. (\u2212)-(1R,3R,4S,8R)-p-Menthane-3,9-diol. To a dry, 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with a gas outlet, an overhead stirrer, and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a gas inlet, is added a solution of 31 g (0.20 mol) of isopulegol (Note 1) in 550 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 2) under nitrogen. From the funnel, 230 mL of a 1.0 M diborane solution (Note 3) is added dropwise with stirring at room temperature at such a rate to insure that gas evolution is not violent. When the addition is complete, the clear solution is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature. The dropping funnel is removed and 100 mL of aqueous 3 N sodium hydroxide is added slowly; the solution is then warmed to 60\u00b0C on the steam bath for 2 hr. The gas outlet is replaced by a thermometer and the septum is replaced by another dropping funnel charged with 120 mL of aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide and the reaction flask is placed in an ice bath. Hydrogen peroxide is then added and the reaction temperature is maintained between 30\u201350\u00b0C by carefully controlling the rate of addition (the reaction is strongly exothermic at the beginning). When the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at 50\u00b0C for 2 hr. The bulk of the THF is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is diluted with 200 mL of ether and washed with brine. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of ether; the resulting extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for several hours and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil is dissolved in 100 mL of hot hexane, allowed to cool slowly, and stored at 0\u00b0C for 2 days. The supernatant mother liquor is decanted, 100 mL of fresh hexane is added, the crystalline mass is swirled for 2\u20133 min and the product is separated by filtration. After vacuum drying, 17.6 g (51%) of (\u2212)-(1R,3R,4S,8R)-p-menthane-3,9-diol is obtained as colorless crystals, mp 105\u2013107\u00b0C (Note 4).",
            "B. (+)-(3aS,7aR)-Hexahydro-(3S,6R)-dimethyl-2(3H)-benzofuranone. To a 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient magnetic stirrer is added 10 g (58 mmol) of (\u2212)-(1R,3R,4S,8R)-p-menthane-3,9-diol and 400 mL of dichloromethane. The resulting suspension is stirred until all the solid dissolves at which time a mixture of powdered potassium permanganate and copper sulfate (CuSO4\u00b75H2O) (Note 5) is added in one portion. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 25\u00b0C between 6 and 8 hr depending upon the quality of the oxidant (Note 6), 400 mL of ether is added, and stirring is continued for an additional 20 min. The suspension is transferred with the aid of a small amount of ether onto a fritted-disk B\u00fcchner funnel containing 50 g of silica gel and a little ether. The spent manganese salt is mixed with some of the silica gel, using a spatula, to insure that all the solution is absorbed. The resulting filter-cake is washed with 500 mL of ether (Note 7). Upon removal of the solvent, the crude product is obtained as a clear, colorless oil. More product is recovered by taking the filter-cake from the funnel and placing it in a 2-L beaker containing 100 mL of ether and a solution of 270 g of sodium metabisulfite in 1 L of water that is cooled in an ice bath (Note 8). The cake is broken up with a glass rod and stirred. To the resulting slurry, 150 mL of aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid is added in portions with stirring until the color turns from dark gray to pale yellow and all the solid material, except the silica, is dissolved. The resulting mixture is filtered and the filtrate is extracted with three 150-mL portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and washed twice with water and once with brine. The ethereal solution is dried by shaking with 30 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated to about 150 mL and stirred with 10 g of Amberlyst-15 for 3 hr (Note 9). After another filtration, the solvent is evaporated and the residual oil is combined with that previously obtained. Purification by vacuum distillation gives 4.8\u20135.0 g (49\u201351% yield) of 3aS,7aR-hexahydro-3S,6R-dimethyl-2(3H)-benzofuranone as a colorless oil, bp 110\u00b0C (0.05 mm) (Note 10)."

The cooled solution (0\u00b0C, ice bath) is purged with argon (10 min) and then a stream of ozone is passed through with vigorous stirring for 4.5 hr (Note 2). After the reaction is complete (TLC, silica gel, diethyl ether/petroleum ether = 1:1), excess ozone is removed by purging with argon (10 min) and 15 mL of dimethyl sulfide (Note 3) is slowly added at 0\u00b0C (ice bath). Stirring is continued for 1 hr at this temperature and 2 hr at ambient temperature. Finally, air is blown through the solution for 12 hr (Note 4) and the residue is distilled at 20 mm, boiling range 90\u2013100\u00b0C (Note 5) to give a yellow liquid that is further purified by filtration through 150 g of silica gel (SiO2) (Note 6) (elution with diethyl ether). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is recrystallized from ethyl acetate to give 23.9 g (80%) of the dimethyl mesoxalate hydrate as colorless crystals (Note 7). Dehydration of the product is accomplished by azeotropic removal of water. The hydrate is dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL) and heated for 12 hr in a Soxhlet apparatus (Note 8) equipped with a thimble containing layers of phosphorus pentoxide and basic alumina. The solvent is then evaporated and the residue distilled at reduced pressure to give 20.1 g (76%) of the ester as a yellow liquid [bp 94\u00b0C (20 mm)]."

The rubber septum in the neck of the Morton flask is replaced with a glass stopper, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr with vigorous stirring under an inert atmosphere (Note 6). The mixture is cooled to room temperature under a stream of nitrogen, triethylamine (46.0 mL, 330 mmol, (Note 7)) is added via syringe at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux, and the mixture is stirred for 15 min after which Pb(NO3)2 (33.1 g, 100 mmol, (Note 8)) is added.

Ethyl 3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate A dry, 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, capped with septa and equipped with a thermometer (Note 1), magnetic stirring bar, and an argon inlet is flushed with argon and charged with dry tetrahydrofuran (400 mL, (Note 2)) and diisopropylamine (30.8 mL, 220 mmol, (Note 3)). The solution is cooled to \u221230\u00b0C and butyllithium (BuLi) (93.2 mL, 220 mmol, 2.36 M solution in hexanes, (Note 4)) is added. The reaction is stirred for 15 min and cooled to \u221276\u00b0 to \u221278\u00b0C. Dry ethyl acetate (19.5 mL, 200 mmol, (Note 5)) is added dropwise so that the internal reaction temperature remains below \u221266\u00b0C (addition time 10\u201315 min). When addition of the ethyl acetate is complete, the reaction is stirred for 50 min at \u221270\u00b0 to \u221278\u00b0C. A solution of freshly distilled acrolein (13.4 mL, 200 mmol, (Note 6)) and 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is then added rapidly via a cannula. The reaction is stirred for 5 min and quenched by the rapid addition of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), (100 mL). The reaction mixture is poured immediately into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of diethyl ether. The reaction flask is rinsed with 100 mL of distilled water and 100 mL of diethyl ether. After thorough mixing, the layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (three, 100-mL portions). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure (Note 7). Crude ethyl 3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate is used in the next step (Note 8).",

A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with ethyl 3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate (Part A) and 400 mL of acetone. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and Jones reagent (175 mL, (Note 9)) is added dropwise via the dropping funnel (addition time is approximately 30\u201340 min). When addition of the Jones reagent is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and is stirred overnight (10\u201320 hr). Methanol (20 mL) is added to quench excess Jones reagent and the reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing diethyl ether (800 mL). After thorough mixing, the layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (three 200-mL portions) (Note 10). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (two 200-mL portions), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent is removed by simple distillation (Note 11). Final purification is accomplished by Kugelrohr distillation (Note 12) at 0.60 mm (oven temp 45\u00b0C) with a 250-mL receiving bulb cooled to \u221278\u00b0C using a dry ice/isopropyl alcohol cold bath. The purified product (14.9 g, 52%) (Note 13) can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for several months without decomposition."

The suspension is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath and 3 N sodium hydroxide (about 133 mL, 0.4 mol) is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature does not exceed 7\u00b0C. The final pH of the suspension is 5.5. The cooling bath is removed and finely powdered 5,6-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono-1,4-lactone (Note 3) (43.6 g, 0.2 mol) is added in one portion. The temperature of the mixture is kept below 30\u00b0C (Note 4). The pH of the suspension is maintained at 5.5 during the course of the reaction by addition of aqueous 15% sodium carbonate (about 15 mL). The suspension is further stirred at room temperature for 30 min, saturated with sodium chloride (105 g), and filtered by suction using a B\u00fcchner funnel. The white solid (Note 5) is washed thoroughly with two 50-mL portions of brine and the pH of the combined aqueous layers is adjusted to 6.7 with aqueous 15% sodium carbonate before extraction with dichloromethane (6 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 6). The combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate (25 g). The magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with two 50-mL portions of dichloromethane. The organic solutions are combined and slowly concentrated to about 50 mL under reduced pressure (Note 7). The remaining solution is placed in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a 10-cm, vacuum-jacketed, Claisen-Vigreux column (10-mm diameter). With constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer, the solution is further concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure (400 mbar) at 35\u00b0C (bath temperature) (Note 8). The temperature of the oil bath is then gradually increased to 80\u00b0C and the glyceraldehyde acetonide is distilled between 51\u00b0C and 52\u00b0C. The distillate is collected in a receiver cooled with an ice-methanol bath (Note 9). Approximately 14.5 g of L-(S)-glyceraldehyde acetonide (56% based on 5,6-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono-1,4-lactone) is obtained."

The flask is equipped with a condenser and heating mantle, and the slurry is stirred vigorously and heated to reflux until the solids are digested to an even consistency. The mantle is removed, the slurry is allowed to cool below reflux, and Celite (10 g) is added with stirring. The contents are further cooled to room temperature and vacuum-filtered through a pad of Celite on a glass frit filter into a three-necked, 2-L vessel. The flask is rinsed with 50 mL of dichloromethane and the rinse is filtered through the funnel. The 2-L vessel is then equipped with an overhead stirrer, thermometer, and water bath, and stirring is begun at 300\u2013350 rpm.

A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is equipped with two 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnels and a low-temperature thermometer (Note 1). The dry apparatus is filled with argon and kept under a slightly positive pressure (ca. 100 mm) of this gas for the entire reaction time. The flask is charged with 200 mL of freshly distilled diethyl ether (Note 2) and 111 mL of a 1.5 M solution of butyllithium (0.167 mol) in hexane (Note 3) and (Note 4). One of the two dropping funnels is charged with 25 g (0.152 mol) of 2-bromothiazole (Note 5) in 50 mL of diethyl ether (Note 2) and the other with 16.5 g (0.152 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 6) in 50 mL of diethyl ether (Note 2). The reaction flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath. While the solution in the flask is stirred, 2-bromothiazole is added dropwise over a period of 1 hr. After 20 min additional stirring, chlorotrimethylsilane is added dropwise over 30 min and stirring is continued for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C. The resulting mixture is then allowed to warm up to room temperature. A saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL) is added and the mixture is transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel. After the mixture is shaken, the organic layer is recovered and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (200 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure by rotary evaporation with the external bath temperature not higher than 40\u00b0C. The residue is distilled from a 100-mL flask at reduced pressure in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 10-cm Vigreux column (Note 7). The distillation, after a forerun at 40\u201365\u00b0C (15 mm) consisting mainly of bromobutane, gives 20.2 g (85%) of 2-(trimethylsilyl)thiazole as a colorless liquid, bp 88\u201391\u00b0C (16\u201317 mm) (Note 8).",

A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, septum, and a connection to the combined vacuum/nitrogen line (Note 1) is charged with 40.0 g (0.120 mol) of (R)-(+)-2-hydroxy-1,2,2-triphenylethyl acetate [(R)-HYTRA].2 The air in the flask is replaced with nitrogen, and 400 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added via a cannula with 1.2 mm inside diameter, whereby the flask is slightly evacuated. The suspension is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath. The ice-cold solution of lithium diisopropylamide, prepared as described above, is added via a cannula under vigorous stirring, whereby the 2-L flask is slightly evacuated. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 60 min to complete the double deprotonation. A clear orange solution forms that is cooled, below \u221270\u00b0C (dry ice/acetone bath). Thereafter, 900 mL of dry 2-methylbutane (Note 4) is added via a cannula. A thermocouple, connected to a resistance thermometer (Note 5), is introduced via the septum. The reaction flask is plunged into a bath of liquid nitrogen, the depth of immersion being 0.5\u20131 cm (Note 6). When the temperature of the suspension has reached \u2212128\u00b0C, a solution of 18.3 mL (0.200 mol) of 2-methylpropanal in 5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise via syringe through the septum at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above \u2212126\u00b0C. Stirring is continued for 90 min at \u2212128\u00b0C to \u2212106\u00b0C (Note 7). The mixture is treated with 500 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and allowed to reach room temperature.\nThe organic layer is separated and washed twice with a total of 200 mL of water. The aqueous reaction layer is extracted five times with a total of 600 mL of chloroform. The organic extracts are washed twice with a total amount of 250 mL of water. The combined organic layers are dried with magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness. The residual solid product is carefully dried under reduced pressure to yield 48\u201350 g (\u2265 100%) (Note 8).\nThe crude product is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser. Methanol (1.4 L), water (0.4 L), and 66.6 g of potassium hydroxide are added and the mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, the organic solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual aqueous alkaline suspension is filtered through a suction filter. The solid (Note 9) is washed carefully with 250 mL of water. In a separatory funnel the combined aqueous layers are washed three times with a total of 300 mL of methylene chloride. The aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask, immersed in an ice bath, and acidified to pH 2.5 by cautious addition of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer, and the pH is controlled carefully to avoid over-acidification. The clear solution is again poured into a separatory funnel, saturated with sodium chloride, and extracted with five 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The pH of the aqueous layer is controlled and readjusted to pH 2.5 by addition of 6 N hydrochloric acid, if necessary. The combined organic layers are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in a rotary evaporator without heating.

The reddish brown suspension is stirred at 100\u00b0C for 10 min (Note 6) and the resulting clear reddish brown solution (Note 7) is cooled. Another dry, 60-mL Schlenk tube is charged with sodium acetate (5.20 g, 63.4 mmol) and methanol (50 mL) (Note 8) and the solution is degassed by three freeze-thaw cycles. It is transferred into the DMF solution of BINAP-Ru(II) complex prepared above via cannula and the solution is stirred at 25\u00b0C for 5 min.

The resulting light yellow solution (Note 17) is then transferred with a cannula into a 100-mL, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a glass vessel (Note 18) and a magnetic stirring bar by use of a slight positive pressure of argon. The autoclave is connected to a hydrogen source (Note 19) using the arrangement shown in Figure 1, and the air originally present in the gas-inlet tube is replaced by hydrogen (Note 20). Valve A is opened and hydrogen is introduced until pressure gauge B indicates 100 atm. The solution is stirred at 20\u00b0C for 8\u201316 hr (Note 21). During hydrogenation, the hydrogen pressure is kept above 90 atm by the occasional introduction of hydrogen from the cylinder (Note 22).

The flask is fitted with a 30-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel to which elemental bromine (5.00 mL, 97.0 mmol) is added by transfer pipette (Note 2). The flask is partially immersed in an oil bath heated to 70\u00b0C. After 10 min for temperature equilibration, dropwise addition of bromine is initiated and completed within 10 min. Complete bromine transfer is achieved by rinsing the addition funnel with a 5-mL portion of carbon tetrachloride. The red-brown solution is heated at 70\u00b0C for 30 min, allowed to cool to ambient temperature, and carbon tetrachloride and excess bromine are removed by rotary evaporation. The pale yellow concentrate is applied to the top of a short column of flash-grade silica gel (150 g, 7-cm diam \u00d7 10 cm) loaded with 5% ethyl acetate-hexanes solution; the product dibromide elutes rapidly with this solvent system (< 1 L total solvent volume, 150-mL fractions, (Note 3)).

An oven-dried, 500-mL, modified Schlenk flask (Kjeldahl shape with 24/40 female top), equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum, is connected at the side-arm to a source of argon and vacuum. The flask is charged with (Z)-2,3-dibromo-2-propenoic acid ethyl ester prepared in part A (21.5 g, 83.4 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide (150 mL). With efficient stirring, it is alternately evacuated and flushed with argon at ambient temperature to deoxygenate the solution (Note 6), (Note 7). The flask is cooled in ice and (trimethylsilyl)acetylene (20.0 mL, 142 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (24.7 mL, 142 mmol) are added in sequence (Note 8). The resulting pale yellow solution is deoxygenated as above. Cuprous iodide (3.18 g, 16.7 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (4.82 g, 4.17 mmol) are added, followed by a third deoxygenation cycle (Note 9). The brown reaction mixture is maintained at 0\u00b0C while the progress of reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), as follows: An aliquot (ca. 0.1 mL) of the reaction mixture is withdrawn with an argon-flushed hypodermic syringe and is injected into a small test tube containing ethyl ether (0.25 mL) and water (0.5 mL). After the biphasic mixture is swirled briefly, the ether layer is allowed to separate and is analyzed by TLC using 20% ethyl ether-hexanes as eluent (Rf of the starting dibromide = 0.67, of the product = 0.76, visualization with ultraviolet light). When TLC analysis indicates consumption of the starting dibromide, typically 3\u20136 hr at 0\u00b0C, the reaction mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing water (300 mL), saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (75 mL), and the tetrasodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (4.50 g, (Note 10)). The resulting brown suspension is extracted with four 150-mL portions of 50% ethyl acetate-hexanes. The organic layers are combined and washed with three 100-mL portions of water, then dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The brown oil thus obtained is filtered through a short column of flash-grade silica gel (150 g, 7-cm diam \u00d7 10 cm), using 20% toluene-hexanes as eluent (< 1.5 L total solvent volume, 150-mL fractions). Fractions containing product (Rf = 0.23, 20% toluene-hexanes) are combined and concentrated. The light brown concentrate is combined with silicone oil (7.0 g) in a 250-mL, 14/20 round-bottomed flask. An insulated 6-in Vigreux column and a short-path distillation head are affixed for vacuum distillation. The system is evacuated (0.9 mm) and the pot is heated to 110\u00b0C whereupon bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne sublimes from the mixture. A heat gun is used to assist in the transfer of this component; the flow of condenser water is initiated only after this phase of the distillation. A liquid forerun is collected (ca. 0.5 mL, head temperature 94\u00b0C, pot temperature ~125\u00b0C) prior to collection of the product.

            "For flash vacuum pyrolysis experiments on a preparative scale the apparatus shown in Figure 1 is used.2 It consists of a vertically-mounted assembly of fused silica and Pyrex tubing 3.2 cm in diameter. The high temperature section A, 45 cm in length, is made from fused silica. It carries inner 29/32 ground glass joints. The upper evaporation section B, 25 cm in length, is made of Pyrex. It is fitted with two outer 29/32 ground glass joints (Note 1). Both tubes are loosely filled with Raschig rings cut from thin-walled, fused silica tubing 1 cm in diameter. The evaporation zone is heated by glass fiber heating tape (180 \u00d7 1 cm) controlled by a variac transformer. Heat for the pyrolysis section is provided by an electric tube furnace (Note 2). The temperature is measured with a thermocouple fixed on the surface of the silica tube in the middle of the hot reaction zone. The substance to be pyrolyzed is added to the evaporator under reduced pressure and at a constant drop rate from a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel C (Note 3). A 250-mL, long-necked, round-bottomed flask D cooled to \u221278\u00b0C serves as a receiver. (Caution! Flask D (Note 4) must be checked by visual inspection at regular intervals. If condensed product accumulates in the entrance neck, the cooling bath level must be lowered to prevent clogging. Flask D must always be cooled to the neck of the flask. Otherwise material might be transferred from the receiver into trap E, which might then become plugged). Flask D is connected by a wide glass tube (Note 4) to a cooling trap E kept at liquid nitrogen temperature (Note 5).\nFigure 1\nAt a pyrolysis oven temperature of 630\u00b0C, an evaporator temperature of 200\u00b0C, and a pressure of 12 mm, 2-toluic acid chloride (240 g, 1.55 mol) (Note 6) is added in about 2.5 hr at a constant rate of 40\u201360 drops/min (Note 7). The pressure should be monitored in the addition funnel C during the pyrolysis. A sudden rise in pressure indicates that a restriction is building up between the pyrolysis reactor and the pump. In this case addition of reactant must be stopped. Ten minutes after the addition is complete the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. The dark brown, oily condensate in the receiver is dissolved in 500 mL of acetone and diluted with 250 mL of cold water (Note 8) and (Note 9). The homogeneous solution is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. It then is separated into two phases by the addition of 500 mL of 2 N sodium carbonate solution and 250 mL of ether. The aqueous layers are extracted twice with 250-mL portions of ether. The ether extracts are washed with 2 N sodium carbonate solution and with saturated sodium chloride solution. The combined ether layers are dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent and distillation of the residue yields 65 g of a yellow oil, bp 87\u201390\u00b0C/13 mm, with the following composition: Benzocyclobutenone (97%), benzyl chloride (3%) (Note 10). Fractionation at 12 mm through a 25-cm spinning band column (Note 11) gives 58 g of benzocyclobutenone (>99%) as a colorless oil, bp 84\u201386\u00b0C/12 mm (Note 12) and (Note 13). The product crystallizes at 0\u00b0C and then melts at 10\u201315\u00b0C (Note 14).\nMost of the acetone is removed from the combined aqueous layers by distillation. Upon acidification with concentrated hydrochloric acid a thick precipitate forms. Filtration and drying leads to 106 g of almost colorless 2-toluic acid, mp 103\u2013107\u00b0C. This material is of sufficient purity for conversion into the acid chloride and for subsequent flash vacuum pyrolysis."

The flask is charged with 80 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 2)), 1.9 g (15 mmol) of anhydrous manganese chloride (Note 3), 0.15 g (1.5 mmol) of cuprous chloride (Note 4), 1.28 g (30 mmol) of lithium chloride (Note 5), and 7.61 g (50 mmol) of (R)-(+)-pulegone (Note 6). The mixture is stirred at room temperature until dissolution of the salts is complete (1 to 2 hr) (Note 7), then a solution of butylmagnesium chloride (58 mmol) in THF (Note 8) is added dropwise at 0\u00b0C over a 25\u201330 min period. Stirring is continued for 1.5 hr at 0\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl, 100 mL). After addition of 80 mL of petroleum ether (35\u201360\u00b0C) and decantation (Note 9), the aqueous layer is extracted three times with 100-mL portions of petroleum ether (35\u201365\u00b0C). The combined organic layers are successively washed with 50 mL of 1 M HCl, 50 mL of a diluted ammonium chloride/ammonium hydroxide (NH4Cl/NH4OH) solution and 50 mL of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, then dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator (20 mm, room temperature). The product is obtained in crude form in almost quantitative yield as a 61.5:38.5 mixture of diastereoisomers, purity > 96% (Note 10). Distillation under reduced pressure affords 9.85 g of pure 2-(dimethylpentyl)-5-methylcyclohexanone (94%, (Note 12)), bp 101\u2013105\u00b0C (3 mm)."

Into the mixture is added ca. 65.5 mL (1.6 N in hexane, ca. 105 mmol) of butyllithium (Note 3) dropwise with a syringe through the septum with stirring at room temperature until the mixture becomes a pale yellow homogeneous solution (Note 4). The solution is stirred for 10 min, then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. Diethylcarbamoyl chloride (12.7 mL, 13.56 g, 100 mmol) (Note 5) is injected through the septum with a syringe, and the solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 10 min. The cold bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature, then stirred for 1 hr. It is cooled again to \u221278\u00b0C, and 62.5 mL (1.6 N, 100 mmol) of butyllithium (Note 3) is injected over a 3-min period. After the solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 5 min, 13.42 g (100 mmol) of 3-phenylpropanal (Note 6) in 50 mL of THF is added from the dropping funnel over a 5-min period. The mixture is stirred for 10 min, warmed to room temperature, and stirred for 1 hr. The mixture is poured into 200 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted with diethyl ether (Et2O) three times, 30 mL each. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at ca. 5 mm. The residual yellowish brown oil is chromatographed (silica gel, 50 mm \u00d7 25 cm) (Note 7). The first, pale yellow fraction eluted with ca. 400 mL of hexane contains dibutyl telluride (23.62 g, 93% based on tellurium used) (Note 8). The next 500-mL fraction (eluted with hexane/Et2O, 10/1) contains by-products (Note 9). The desired product is eluted in the third fraction (ca. 500 mL of Et2O) that is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and distilled to afford 19.35 g of N,N-diethyl-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanamide as a pale yellow viscous oil (bp 155\u2013156\u00b0C at 0.6 mm, 82%) (Note 10),(Note 11),(Note 12)."

An oven-dried, two-necked, 500-mL flask equipped with a septum cap, nitrogen bubbler, and magnetic stirrer is charged with 2-methoxybenzoic acid (20 g, 0.13 mol) (Note 1) under nitrogen. Thionyl chloride (135 mL, 220 g, 1.85 mol) (Note 2) is added with stirring, resulting in slow effervescence. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.34 mL, 320 mg, 4.4 mmol) (Note 3),(Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe after which effervescence becomes much more vigorous (CAUTION: Sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are evolved). The solution is stirred for 0.5 hr, at which time no further effervescence is visible. Half of the thionyl chloride is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, toluene (100 mL) is added, and the mixture is evaporated to dryness. A further 100 mL of toluene is added and the process of evaporation is repeated twice more to ensure complete removal of all excess thionyl chloride (Note 5). The colorless oil is dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 150 mL) (Note 6), the resulting solution is cooled in an ice water bath, and treated slowly with diethylamine (50 mL, 35.3 g, 0.48 mol) (Note 7), with stirring to prevent the reaction from becoming too vigorous. A copious white precipitate forms.\nWhen all the diethylamine has been added the mixture is stirred for a further 10 min and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in methylene chloride (200 mL), washed with water (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and saturated brine (2 \u00d7 50 mL), and concentrated under reduced pressure to give an orange oil. The oil is distilled at reduced pressure to give 23.5\u201324.5 g (86\u201390%) of N,N-diethyl-2-methoxybenzamide (118\u2013120\u00b0C/0.1 mm) as a straw-colored liquid.",

The apparatus is charged with 600 mL (Note 2) of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 3) and 56 g (0.21 mol) of 4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl (DBB) (Note 4). Lithium pieces (1.5 g, 0.22 M) (Note 5) are then introduced under argon into the well-stirred DBB solution in THF at room temperature. As soon as the dark blue-greenish color of the LDBB solution appears, the flask is immersed in an ice-cold bath (Note 6) and the solution is vigorously stirred for 4 hr at 0\u00b0C. The LDBB solution so prepared is ready for further use.",

Isobutylene oxide (7.2 g, 0.10 mol) (Note 7) is added dropwise from the pressure-equalizing funnel to the LDBB solution in THF at \u221278\u00b0C at such a rate (the addition lasts for 8\u201312 min) that the temperature inside the flask does not exceed \u221278\u00b0C. After all the epoxide has been added (8\u201311 min), the solution becomes deep red. After 5 more minutes of stirring, isobutyraldehyde (7.2 g, 0.10 mol) (Note 8) is added dropwise within 5 min. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C; it is allowed to reach 0\u00b0C by removing the cold bath, and finally is quenched with water (100 mL). After the mixture is extracted with ether (1 \u00d7 300 mL, 2 \u00d7 100 mL), the combined organic layers are dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and the solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure. The addition of cold methanol (250 mL) results in precipitation of most of the DBB as a white solid. The latter is crushed in methanol to a fine powder with a spatula and the methanolic suspension is placed in a freezer for 1 hr. The solid is filtered, washed with 50\u2013250 mL of ice-cold methanol and air-dried; the yield is 49.1 g (88% recovery). The methanol is evaporated under reduced pressure and the product is isolated by flash chromatography (25% ethyl acetate in hexane as the eluent); yield 11.3\u201312.3 g (77\u201388%). An additional vacuum distillation at 104\u2013105\u00b0C/13 mm provides >99% pure product, yield 9.2 g (62\u201366%) ((Note 9),(Note 10))."

The resulting mixture is cooled in an ice bath, efficient stirring is begun, and 72 mL (100 g, 0.82 mol) of allyl bromide (Note 2) is added dropwise, keeping the internal temperature below 10\u00b0C (Note 3). After the solution is stirred overnight, the sticky white solid is collected by suction filtration and the collected solids are washed with 300 mL of hexanes. The combined yellow filtrate and washings are dried thoroughly over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and the whole mixture is distilled from calcium hydride (CaH2) through a 6-in. Vigreux column (Note 4).

A flame-dried, three-necked, 1000-mL flask that is equipped for magnetic stirring, and has a dry addition funnel and a thermometer, is placed under an inert atmosphere and charged with 209 mL (250 g, 0.209 mol) of a 1.0 M solution of borane-tetrahydrofuran complex (Note 2). The resulting solution is cooled to \u221210\u00b0C using a dry ice/ethylene glycol bath and 3-(2-methoxyethoxy)propene (1, 60 g, 0.52 mol) is added dropwise over ~1 hr keeping the internal temperature of the reaction mixture at or below 0\u00b0C. Methanol (1.5 mL) is added to destroy any excess borane, and the reaction mixture is stirred an additional 1 hr below 10\u00b0C.\nAfter the reaction mixture is recooled to \u221215\u00b0C (internal temperature), 35 mL (107.8 g, 0.67 mol) of bromine (Br2) is added dropwise over 1 hr, keeping the reaction temperature between \u221210\u00b0 and 0\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred a further 1.5 hr at 0\u00b0C then recooled to \u221215\u00b0C. While cooling is maintained, 210 mL of a 4 M solution of sodium methoxide (0.84 mol) in methanol (freshly prepared from sodium metal) is added dropwise over 1.5 hr, keeping the reaction temperature between \u221215\u00b0 and 0\u00b0C. The resulting orange brown solution and white precipitate are slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight (16 hr).\nHexane (100 mL) is added to the reaction mixture causing more white precipitate to form. The mixture is filtered by suction, and the collected solids are washed with two 50-mL portions of hexane. The combined filtrate and washings are partitioned with 200 mL of a mixture (1:3 v/v) of saturated potassium carbonate solution and water (Note 8). The aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic phases are partitioned with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride, dried thoroughly over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 65\u201375 g of crude product. A small amount of additional crude material can be isolated by continuously extracting the combined aqueous layers with hexane for 3 hr.\nDistillation of the crude product through a 6-in. Vigreux column at 0.6 mm into a dry ice/acetone-cooled receiver affords 55\u201370 g of material bp >40\u00b0C/0.6 mm that is ~83% pure (as judged by gas chromatography, (Note 6)). To obtain material of greater purity (94%) suitable for further transformation, a second distillation through a 6-in. Vigreux column packed with glass beads is required to afford 53\u201357 g (52\u201356%) of the bromide as a colorless liquid, bp 55\u201365\u00b0C/0.6 mm (Note 9).",

A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer and a dried addition funnel, charged with 9.1 g (0.375 mol) of magnesium metal turnings (Note 2) and heated with a flame or heat gun while purging with argon. After the flask is cooled, 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a crystal of iodine are added, and the addition funnel is charged with 40 mL (52 g, 0.264 mol) of 1-bromo-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)propane (2, (Note 10)). Approximately 2 mL of the bromide is added to the reaction mixture, and the internal temperature of the mixture is monitored. When the temperature rises slightly (~3\u00b0C) and the iodine color is discharged indicating that formation of the Grignard reagent has begun, the reaction mixture is immediately cooled to \u221215\u00b0C in a dry ice/ethylene glycol bath, 100 mL of dry THF (Note 10) is added to the addition funnel, and 150 mL of dry THF (Note 10) is directly added to the reaction mixture. The bromide solution is added dropwise over 2 hr while keeping the reaction temperature between \u221215\u00b0 and 5\u00b0C (Note 11).\nThe concentration of the Grignard reagent solution is determined by titration. An oven-dried, 10-mL flask with septum is charged with 1 mg of phenanthroline and 3.0 mL of the reaction mixture. 2-Methylpropanol is added until the red-purple color is dissipated and a yellow endpoint is reached. The yield of Grignard reagent is 0.184 mol (70%).\nA dry, 1000-mL flask is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, charged with 4.9 mL (0.042 mol) of tin(IV) chloride (SnCl4, (Note 1)), and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath with swirling. After the SnCl4 solidifies on the walls of the flask, the flask is equipped for magnetic stirring. The previously prepared Grignard solution is added to the SnCl4 as a slow stream via cannula and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring overnight (20 hr). After the solution is stirred at room temperature for ~20 hr, the addition funnel is replaced by a reflux condenser, and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 hr by means of a heating mantle (Note 12). After the solution is cooled, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, 300 mL of water is added, and the resulting mixture (a heavy precipitate results) is continuously extracted with 750 mL of hexane for 12\u201324 hr. The hexane solution is dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and the volatile material is removed under reduced pressure, to afford 23.6\u201324 g (96\u201397% based on SnCl4) of the tetraalkylstannane that is not homogeneous as judged by NMR integration. Pure stannane suitable for further transformation is obtained by removal of a low boiling impurity (bp 90\u2013100\u00b0C/0.6 mm) under high vacuum to afford 21\u201323 g of purified stannane. Stannane (bp 210\u2013215\u00b0C at 0.005 mm) of even higher purity can be obtained by short-path distillation with some loss due to decomposition (Note 13).",

After the mixture is cooled to ~0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, 14 mL of a 1 M solution of bromine (0.014 mol) in CCl4 is added dropwise (Note 14). The mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and stand overnight. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residual brown liquid is purified by Kugelrohr distillation at 0.1 mm. A low boiling fraction (bp <70\u00b0C) that contains alkyl bromide is discarded, and the residual material is distilled to afford 6.9\u20137.4 g (90\u201396%) of the bromotrialkylstannane (bp 100\u2013110\u00b0C) as a pale tan viscous oil that is homogeneous as judged by NMR spectroscopy and of sufficient purity for further transformation (Note 15),(Note 16),(Note 17).",
            "E. Tris[3-(2-methoxyethoxy)propyl]stannane (5).

To the stirred solution is added 2.0 g (54 mmol) of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) (Note 2) at room temperature in portions at such a rate as is required to control foaming. The resulting white suspension is stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hr (the reaction appears complete nearly instantaneously) and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is taken up in 50 mL of ether, suction filtered through a bed of Celite, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 3.47\u20133.64 g (82\u201386%) of the trialkyltin hydride as a clear colorless oil that is homogeneous by NMR.

The tube is sealed and stirred for 20 hr in an oil bath at 90\u00b0C (Note 5). The reaction mixture is combined with that from another run at the same scale and diluted with 40 mL of hexane (the mixture separates into a cloudy supernatant and a brown resin). The hexane layer is separated and the resinous precipitate extracted with two 20-mL portions of hexane. The combined solutions are filtered through a bed of silica gel on a 60-mL fritted glass funnel and the resulting clear filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation using a water aspirator.

Toward the end of the addition, an additional portion of dimethyl sulfoxide (200 mL) is added via syringe to lower the viscosity of the reaction mixture. After the addition is complete, the mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath, diluted with 100 mL of pentane, and cautiously quenched with 12 M hydrochloric acid until no further gas evolution occurs. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with three 100-mL portions of 5% brine.

            "A. (Trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane. A 2-L, three-necked flask is fitted with an efficient, overhead, sealed mechanical stirrer, a cold-finger condenser (30-cm in length and 8-cm in diameter) and a rubber septum (Note 1). The top outlet of the condenser is attached to an oil bubbler. The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen and charged with 118.8 g (1.09 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 2) in 100 mL of anhydrous benzonitrile (Note 3). The septum is replaced quickly under dry nitrogen with a 500-mL Ace dry ice gas condenser trap (15-cm in length and 8-cm in diameter) (Note 4). The outlet of the trap is protected from moisture by a tube packed with potassium hydroxide and the inlet is connected by tygon tubing to a cylinder of bromotrifluoromethane (Note 5). The 2-L flask is immersed in a dry ice-acetone bath maintained at \u221230\u00b0C (Note 6) and the condensers are filled with dry ice-acetone mixture (\u221278\u00b0C). The cylinder is opened and 250 mL (d = 1.94 g/mL,2 485 g, 3.25 mol) of bromotrifluoromethane is condensed into the 500-mL Ace reservoir (Note 7). Stirring is started, and the condensed liquid bromotrifluoromethane is gradually added to the vessel at \u221230\u00b0C by slowly warming the reservoir to \u221245\u00b0C to \u221250\u00b0C. The resulting white slurry is further cooled to \u221260\u00b0C (Note 6) and (Note 8). The Ace dry ice gas condenser trap is disconnected under dry nitrogen and replaced with a 600-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of 325.0 g (1.31 mol) of hexaethylphosphorous triamide (Note 9) in 250 mL of dry benzonitrile. This solution is added with stirring at \u221260\u00b0C to the white slurry mixture over a period of 2.5 hr. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour at \u221260\u00b0C (Note 10), and then allowed to warm gradually to room temperature (25\u00b0C) over a period of 14 hr, during which time it turns clear yellow (Note 11). The condenser and dropping funnel are removed and replaced by a glass stopper and joint adapter with its glass tube connected to two, 250-mL, dry ice/acetone-cooled traps; then aspirator vacuum (ca. 20 mm) is applied. The reaction flask is gently warmed to 50\u00b0C during which time (3 hr) all the volatile material collects in the cooled traps (Note 12). The cooling baths are removed and the material in the traps is brought to 0\u00b0C. The colorless liquid is transferred quickly to a 250-mL separatory funnel, washed rapidly with ice cold water (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the top organic product layer is separated (Note 13). The product is dried over 5 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the dry liquid is decanted into a 250-mL flask. The product is fractionally distilled through a 15-cm column packed with glass helices. Three fractions are collected. The first minor fraction (bp 45\u201354\u00b0C) and the second major fraction (bp 54\u201355\u00b0C) contain the main quantity of (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane. The third minor fraction (bp 55\u201365\u00b0C) consists mainly of hexamethyldisiloxane with a small quantity of product (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (Note 14). The first and second fractions are combined to yield 116.9 g (75%) of clear liquid product (Note 15) and (Note 16), bp 54\u201355\u00b0C (Note 17).",

Tetrahydrofuran (70 mL) (Note 18) and 19.2 g (0.13 mol) of (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane are introduced into the flask through the septum using dry syringes (Note 19). The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath (0\u00b0C), and a solution of 10.2 g (0.104 mol) of cyclohexanone (Note 20) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred solution of (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane using a syringe. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate (33 mg) catalyst (Note 21),(Note 22) is transferred into the reaction vessel. As the exothermic reaction proceeds, a yellowish brown color develops with the initial evolution of fluorotrimethylsilane (Note 23). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 30 min and then the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is brought to room temperature and stirred for an additional hour. The reaction mixture is periodically analyzed by GC-MS and the reaction is complete within 1 hr at 25\u00b0C (Note 24). To the reaction mixture that contains crude 1-trifluoromethyl-1-O-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexane are added 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 40 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 8 hr and then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel containing 50 mL of water. The product is extracted with 50 mL of ether. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is reextracted with 30 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with 50 mL of water, dried over 10 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The residue is repeatedly washed with dry ether (3 \u00d7 20 mL).

The flask is flame-dried, flushed with nitrogen (the checkers used argon throughout), and charged with 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1). The dropping funnel is charged with 140 mL of a 1.5 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (0.210 mol) (Note 2). The flask is cooled to \u221220\u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath (Note 3), stirring is started, and butyllithium is added to tetrahydrofuran over a few minutes. The resulting yellow solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. The cooling bath is then kept just below the bottom of the flask while a solution of triethyl phosphate (18.2 g, 0.1 mol) (Note 4) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) is added dropwise from the dropping funnel over 15 min at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture slowly rises to 0\u00b0C (Note 5). The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 15 min at 0\u00b0C. By this time, the yellow color has practically disappeared and the solution is clear. The reaction mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and a solution of ethyl formate (7.9 g, 0.107 mol) (Note 6) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) is added dropwise at this temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min, then allowed to warm up slowly to 0\u00b0C, and quenched by the dropwise addition of 80 mL of 3 M hydrochloric acid.

A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1.5-in egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing, addition funnel fitted with a Claisen adapter that contains a drying tube and stopper. The flask is charged with 40.8 g (0.30 mol) of phenyl vinyl sulfide (Note 1) and 250 mL of dichloromethane (Note 2). The resulting solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and 49.6 g (0.31 mol) of bromine (Note 3) is added dropwise over approximately 1 hr through the funnel, until a bright red color persists. The intermediate product, phenylthio-1,2-dibromoethane (Note 4), is then treated at 0\u00b0C with 250 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide followed by 5.1 g (15 mmol, 5 mol%) of the phase-transfer catalyst tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate.

            "B. Phenylthioacetylene. An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 8), an acetone-dry ice condenser with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets, and a gas inlet. The flask is placed in an acetone-dry ice bath (\u221240\u00b0C, bath temperature) and 450 mL of anhydrous ammonia (Note 9) is condensed into the flask. Upon addition of a small piece of sodium metal (ca. 0.6 g) to the liquid ammonia the characteristic deep blue color develops. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.25 g, 1.5 mmol; 0.3 mol%) is added with continued stirring (Note 10) and the color of the reaction mixture turns gray. The remaining sodium metal (10.0 g, 0.46 g-atom total) is added in 0.6-g pieces over ca. 1 hr, since the blue color must be discharged before each new addition of sodium. A gray suspension of sodium amide is obtained upon completion of this addition. The temperature of the cooling bath is adjusted to \u221250\u00b0C and the gas inlet is replaced with a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing 49.5 g (0.23 mol) of 1-bromovinyl phenyl sulfide in 100 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 11). This solution is added dropwise to the freshly generated sodium amide over 20 min, while the temperature of the acetone-dry ice bath is maintained at \u221250\u00b0C. Stirring is continued (Note 8) at this temperature for 0.5 hr, the brown-red reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature (\u221233\u00b0C) during 1 hr, and then is recooled to \u221260\u00b0C (bath temperature). Solid ammonium chloride is added slowly (Note 12) to quench the sodium phenylthioacetylide, the cooling bath is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During evaporation, 400 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 13) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace ammonia. The resulting mixture is filtered at ambient temperature and reduced pressure through a coarse, Celite-packed, fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts that are subsequently washed three times with 50 mL of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrate and washes are concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the dark brown residue (Note 14) is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a short-path distillation head. Pure product (Note 15) is distilled at 1.5 mm pressure (bp 48\u201350\u00b0C, (Note 16)) into an ice-cooled receiver. In this way, 21.6\u201324.7 g (70\u201380% yield) of phenylthioacetylene (Note 17) is obtained as a pale yellow liquid, which turns brown-red upon storage at \u221210\u00b0C (freezer) within a few hours (Note 18). Phenylthioacetylene stored under these conditions is stable for several months."

An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for mechanical stirring, and outfitted with a reflux condenser bearing an argon inlet/outlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, and a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, is placed under an argon atmosphere and charged with 20.94 g (0.552 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), and 850 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 1) and (Note 2). A solution of 87.46 mL (97.78 g, 0.44 mol) of diethyl phthalate (Note 1) in 170 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 1.5 hr with efficient mechanical stirring, at a rate of addition adjusted to maintain a gentle reflux (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated to reflux by means of a heating mantle for 1.5 hr. The mechanically stirred reaction mixture is then cooled to ~0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, and quenched by cautious sequential addition of 21 mL of water, 21 mL of aqueous 15% sodium hydroxide solution, and 63 mL of water (Note 4). While stirring is continued, the mixture is held for 30 min at 0\u00b0C then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting white solids are collected by vacuum filtration and washed on the filter using a total of 1 L of ether in 100-mL portions (Note 5). Concentration of the filtrate, under reduced pressure, affords 56.64 g (93%) of 1,2-benzenedimethanol as a white solid, mp 62\u201364\u00b0C, which is sufficiently pure for further transformation (Note 6).",
            "B. 3-Vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine. An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a calcium chloride drying tube, and two rubber septa. The flask is charged with 41.45 g (0.3 mol) of 1,2-benzenedimethanol, 5.71 g (0.03 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 1), and 600 mL of dry 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 1) and (Note 7). Stirring is initiated, and 49.2 mL (0.45 mol) of trimethyl orthoformate (Note 1) and 30.1 mL (0.45 mol) of acrolein (Note 1) are then added sequentially via syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 hr (Note 8), then poured into a mixture of ice and 150 mL of aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate solution in a 2-L separatory funnel using 90 mL of ether to rinse the flask. After thorough mixing, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 300 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are washed sequentially with 90 mL of cold aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate solution and 90 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 52 g (99%) of crude acetal. Distillation of the residual liquid under reduced pressure affords 39.6\u201340.4 g (75\u201377%) of 3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine as a colorless liquid, bp 116\u2013118\u00b0C (5 mm), that may crystallize on standing, mp ~30\u00b0C (Note 9) and (Note 10).",
            "C. 3-[(1S)-1,2-Dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with dihydroquinidine 9-O-(9'-phenanthryl) ether (Note 1) and (Note 11), [0.75 g, (1.5 mmol, 1 mol%, 0.0057 M in the organic phase)], 148.2 g (0.45 mol) of potassium ferricyanide (Note 1), 62.2 g (0.45 mol) of potassium carbonate (Note 1), 264 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (tert-BuOH) (Note 1), and 264 mL of distilled water. Mechanical stirring is initiated, 0.11 g (0.3 mmol, 0.2 mol%) of potassium osmate (VI) dihydrate, which generates a 0.0011 M solution of OsO4 in the organic phase (Note 1), is added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hr, resulting in an orange suspension. The flask is immersed in a 0\u00b0C cooling bath, and the mixture stirred for 1 hr (Note 12). Over a period of 24 hr at 0\u00b0C, 26.25 g (0.16 mol) of 3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine is added dropwise via syringe (Note 13), and the reaction mixture is stirred an additional 24 hr at 0\u00b0C (Note 14). After the required time period has elapsed, 30.25 g (0.24 mol) of solid sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is added in portions, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature, poured into a 3-L beaker, and allowed to stand for another 1 hr at room temperature (Note 1). After the organic phase is decanted, the aqueous phase is diluted with 300 mL of water to dissolve the salts, and poured into a 2-L separatory funnel using 90 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to rinse the flask and beaker. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 150 mL of CH2Cl2. The organic extracts are combined with the decanted organic phase, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated, under reduced pressure, to afford 33.1 g (104%) of crude product, as a pale yellow liquid (Note 15) that crystallizes rapidly. The ee of the crude 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine is determined by HPLC analysis of the derived bis-Mosher ester to be 84% (Note 16).\nA 2-L Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 33.1 g of the crude protected diol which is dissolved in 600 mL of hot ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hr and at 0\u00b0C to \u22125\u00b0C for 24 hr (Note 17). The resulting white precipitate is collected by suction filtration through a 10-cm B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 18), and the mother liquor is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 21.15 g of a pale yellow liquid that slowly crystallizes (Note 19). The residual liquid is placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask, dissolved in 150 mL of hot toluene (Note 20), and allowed to stand for 24 hr at 0\u00b0C to \u22125\u00b0C. The slightly yellow precipitate is collected by suction filtration through a 10-cm B\u00fcchner funnel and dried under reduced pressure to give 16.0\u201317.4 g (50\u201355%) of 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine, mp 73\u201375\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D23 \u221212.4\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 2.62) (Note 21). The ee of the product is determined by HPLC analysis of the derived bis-Mosher ester to be 97% (Note 16).\nThe mother liquor is then concentrated to afford 2.4 g of a brown yellow liquid (Note 22). Flash chromatography of this material on 30 g of SiO2 with elution by EtOAc then by EtOAc:MeOH (5:1 v/v) affords 0.63 g (2%) of 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine and 0.69 g (92% recovery) of dihydroquinidine 9-O-(9'-phenanthryl) ether."

A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, loose fitting rubber septum, and a needle for nitrogen inlet which is vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 6.60 g (51.1 mmol) of (R)-(+)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Note 1) and 200 mL of methanol (Note 2). Thionyl chloride (0.50 mL, 6.8 mmol) is added cautiously by syringe over a 0.5-min period to the rapidly stirring solution at room temperature. The reaction flask is sealed with the septum and the nitrogen inlet removed after addition is complete, and the resulting solution is stirred continuously at room temperature for 24 hr. The flask is uncapped, and aqueous, saturated sodium carbonate is added with stirring until the reaction solution is pH 7 to litmus paper (Note 3). After removal of the methanol at room temperature under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator, the residue is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 10 mL of aqueous, saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to afford 5.60 g (75% yield) of colorless methyl (R)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate, bp 83\u00b0C (0.25 mm), [\u03b1]24D \u22128.6\u00b0 (EtOH, c 1.13) (Note 4).",

A 50-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and nitrogen inlet, is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 200 mg (0.452 mmol) of rhodium(II) acetate (Note 5), 1.02 g (7.13 mmol) of methyl 2-pyrrolidone-5(R)-carboxylate, and 20 mL of chlorobenzene (Note 6). The flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus (Note 7) into which is placed a thimble containing 5 g of an oven-dried mixture of 2 parts sodium carbonate and 1 part of sand (Note 8). The initially green rhodium acetate, upon mixing with the pyrrolidonecarboxylate forms a blue solution, which is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 6 hr (Note 9); removal of the solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator yields a blue, glass-like solid. The solid is dissolved in a minimal volume of methanol and purified by chromatography on a column containing J.T. Baker BAKERBOND Cyano 40 \u03bcm prep LC pacKing (10 g) in methanol. The dirhodium(II) product forms a broad blue band across the top of the column, which moves imperceptively with methanol. However, the excess ligand moves rapidly as a yellow/brown band in methanol and may be collected with the first 100 mL of eluent (Note 10). Subsequent elution with 1.0 vol % acetonitrile in methanol causes an instantaneous color change from blue to red and rapid elution. The entire red band is collected as one fraction, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure (Note 11), (Note 12). The resulting blue, glass-like solid (380 mg) is recrystallized by dissolving the solid in 1.0 mL of acetonitrile per 100 mg of solid and then adding an equivalent amount of isopropyl alcohol. Bright red crystals of Rh2 (5R-MEPY)4 (CH3CN)2 (i-PrOH) form overnight, and are collected by suction, washed with isopropyl alcohol and air-dried to yield 240 mg (0.262 mmol, 58% yield) (Note 13).",
            "C. 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetoacetate. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, stoppered pressure-equalizing addition funnel and a reflux condenser bearing a drying tube, is charged with a solution of 21.5 g (0.250 mol) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol in 70 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 1.20 g (0.015 mol) of sodium acetate (Note 14). The reaction mixture is heated at reflux with continuous magnetic stirring, and a solution of 23.5 g (0.280 mol) of freshly distilled diketene in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 1 hr (Note 15). The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for an additional 30 min upon completion of the addition. The brown reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, transferred to a separatory funnel containing 300 mL of ether and 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, mixed thoroughly, and the aqueous layer withdrawn. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with 50-mL portions of ether, and the combined ether solution is washed twice with 50-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. After the organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the brown residue is distilled (bp 85\u00b0C, 0.15 mm) to afford 28.9 g (68% yield) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetoacetate as a colorless liquid (Note 16).",
            "D. 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-yl diazoacetate. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a stoppered, pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with a solution of 30.5 g (0.179 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetoacetate and 23.3 g (0.231 mol) of triethylamine> in 150 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile (Note 16). A solution of 55.85 g (0.233 mol) of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide in 150 mL of acetonitrile is added dropwise over 30 min with continuous magnetic stirring (Note 17). A white precipitate of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonamide is observed after ~30 min (additional acetonitrile is added if necessary to facilitate stirring). The resulting heterogeneous yellow mixture is maintained at room temperature for an additional 2.5\u20133 hr (Note 18). A solution of 24.6 g (0.586 mol) of lithium hydroxide (LiOH\u00b7H2O) in 200 mL of water is added to the reaction mixture (the precipitate dissolves), and the resulting light brown mixture is stirred for 8 hr (Note 19). The reaction mixture is extracted with two 50-mL portions of 2:1 ether:ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are washed with one 25-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resulting orange liquid, containing some solid sulfonamide, is purified by flash column chromatography on silica (200 g) with 1:10 ethyl acetate:hexane as the eluent. Collection of the yellow band and concentration under reduced pressure affords 22.39 g (81% yield) of 3-methyl-2-butenyl diazoacetate as a yellow oil (Note 20).",

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stoppered pressure-equalizing addition funnel and a reflux condenser bearing a drying tube and a nitrogen inlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is charged with a solution of 0.203 g (0.221 mmol) of Rh2 (5R-MEPY)4 (CH3CN)2 (i-PrOH) in 150 mL of freshly distilled, anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 21). The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux during the dropwise addition of a solution of 14.9 g (96.7 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl diazoacetate in 450 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane over a 30-hr period. The slow flow of external inert gas is terminated after 1 hr, and the evolution of nitrogen from the reaction solution is used to monitor the progress of the reaction. After the addition is complete, the blue reaction mixture is heated at reflux for an additional hour, cooled to room temperature, and the solvent is removed from the green reaction mixture under reduced pressure. Kugelrohr distillation of the residue (80\u00b0C, 0.15 mm) affords 12.1 g of a nearly colorless liquid that upon chromatographic purification on silica-alumina (100 g) with hexane:ethyl acetate (80:20 to 70:30) affords 10.2\u201310.7 g (84\u201388% yield) of >99% pure (1R,5S)-(\u2212)-6,6-dimethyl-2-oxabicyclo- [3.1.0]hexan-2-one, bp 70\u00b0C (0.15 mm), [\u03b1]24D \u221281.2\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 2.4) (Note 22), whose optical purity was determined on a Chiraldex B-PH capillary column to be 92\u201393% ee (Note 23).

        "Procedure": [
            "A. cis-3,5-Diacetoxycyclopentene. A flame-dried, 100-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a serum cap, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, and an 18-gauge needle attached to a dry source of argon vented through a mineral oil bubbler. The apparatus is flushed with argon and charged with 16.70 g (118 mmol) of (\u00b1)-cis-4-acetoxy-1-hydroxycyclopent-2-ene [(\u00b1)-1] (Note 1) and 20 mL of methylene chloride (Note 2). To this stirred solution is added 8.81 g (129 mmol) of imidazole in one portion (Note 3). When dissolution is complete, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Acetic anhydride (13.20 g, 12.20 mL, 129 mmol) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 5 min by means of an oven-dried syringe and needle. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to stir at ambient temperature until judged complete by TLC analysis (Note 5). The contents of the flask are transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and diluted with 60 mL of reagent grade ethyl ether. The contents of the separatory funnel are washed with 60 mL of ice-cold 1 N hydrochloric acid which results in noticeable removal of all color from the organic phase. The acidic aqueous phase is back-extracted with two 50-mL portions of ether (Note 6). The combined organic phases are washed with a single 50-mL portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution followed by back-extraction of the aqueous phase with three 50-mL portions of ether (Note 6). The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under rotary evaporation at 30 mm. The resulting viscous tan oil is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to afford 20.9\u201321.1 g (96\u201398%) of cis-3,5-diacetoxycyclopentene (2) (Note 7) as a colorless liquid, bp 55\u201356\u00b0C at 0.1 mm.",
            "B. (1R,4S)-(+)-4-Hydroxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate. A rigorously clean 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, equipped with a 2-in. long Teflon-coated stirring bar (Note 8), is charged with 320 mL of a 1.45 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer concentrate (Note 9). The solution is diluted to a final volume of 800 mL with the addition of 480 mL of glass-distilled water. To the gently stirred solution (Note 10) is added 78 mg of sodium azide (Note 11) followed by 18.6 mg (200 units/mg) of lyophilized electric eel acetyl cholinesterase (EEAC) (Note 12). The enzyme completely dissolves within 5 min after which time 16.01 g (87.0 mmol) of cis-3,5-diacetoxycyclopentene is added in one portion. A few extra mL of distilled water are used to facilitate a quantitative transfer of the diacetate. Parafilm is placed over the mouth of the flask and the two-phase system (Note 13) is allowed to stir at room temperature (Note 14). The progress of the reaction is conveniently monitored by periodic TLC analysis. The reaction is terminated when only a trace of diacetate remains and the corresponding diol begins to appear (Note 15). The aqueous phase is first extracted three times with 150-mL portions of ether followed by fifteen 150-mL extractions with a 1:1 mixture of ether/ethyl acetate (Note 16). The organic extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by rotory evaporation at ~30 mm (Note 17). The residue is passed through a 60-g plug of silica gel (Note 18) with approximately 750 mL of ether. Removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation followed by exposure to oil pump vacuum affords 11.32 g of nearly colorless material [mp 43\u201349\u00b0C (corrected)]. Vacuum distillation (Note 19) of the product through a short-path apparatus at 64\u00b0C/0.060 mm furnishes 10.64\u201310.76 g (86\u201387%, 96% e.e.) of colorless solid (+) hydroxy acetate 1 (mp 44.5\u201349.5\u00b0C (corrected), [\u03b1]D23 +62.9\u00b0 (chloroform, c 1.465)) (Note 20). A sample recrystallized from 1:1 pentane/ether (approximately 5 mL/g) provides high purity (\u226599% e.e.), colorless needles of 1 (mp 50.7\u201351.3\u00b0C (corrected), [\u03b1]D23 +73.8\u00b0 (chloroform, c 1.25) [lit.2 mp 49\u00b0 \u2212 51\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D23 +68.0\u00b0 (chloroform, c 1.64)] (Note 21)."

A 4.0-g lot of wheat germ lipase (Note 9) is added slowly with rapid stirring. Once the enzyme is dispersed, the speed of the stirrer is reduced and the flask is sealed with a glass stopper prior to being stirred at room temperature for 7 days (Note 10). The stopper is removed and the contents of the flask are transferred to the body of a lighter than water continuous extraction apparatus whose pot is charged with 1 L of ethyl acetate. After extraction for 3 days, the ethyl acetate solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel using 30% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether (bp 35\u201360\u00b0C) as eluent (Note 11).

            "A. 1-Chloro-1-[(dimethyl)phenylsilyl]hexane. An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is purged with argon via an inlet hose equipped with a needle and an outlet hose equipped with a needle leading to an oil bubbler. The flask is charged with 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1) and 7.37 g of lithium wire (1.06 mol) cut into small pieces (Note 2). After cooling the reaction mixture to 0\u00b0C in a CryoCool bath (Note 3), 30 g (29.1 mL, 176 mmol) of phenyldimethylsilyl chloride is added via syringe and the reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 16 hr (Note 4).2 Within 0.5 hr, the reaction mixture turns from clear and colorless to dark red. An oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is purged with argon via an inlet needle and an outlet needle to an oil bubbler, charged with 16.78 g (20.0 mL, 167.5 mmol) of hexanal and 400 mL of dry THF (Note 5), and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. The solution of phenyldimethylsilyllithium in THF prepared above is then added via cannula. After addition, the red reaction mixture is warmed to 0\u00b0C and stirred for 1 hr. A saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (250 mL) is then added in one portion and the resulting mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 250 mL of diethyl ether. The organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (3 \u00d7 250-mL) and brine (250 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification via flash column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 450 g of oil, loaded with hexanes, eluant 10:1 hexanes:diethyl ether) yields a total of 32.6 g (82%) of 1-[(dimethyl)phenylsilyl]-1-hexanol as a colorless oil (a second column with 250 g of silica gel may be required for rechromatography of tailing fractions).\nAn oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 500 mL of dry THF and 1-[(dimethyl)phenylsilyl]-1-hexanol (32.6 g, 138 mmol). Carbon tetrachloride (53.20 g, 33.4 mL, 345.9 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (54.30 g, 207 mmol) are added and the flask is equipped with a condenser and a rubber septum and purged with argon via inlet needle and outlet needle to an oil bubbler.3 The reaction mixture is heated to reflux under argon for 12 hr. After the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, the volatiles are removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is triturated with hexanes (3 \u00d7 300-mL). Concentration of the extracts under reduced pressure and purification via flash column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 450 g, eluant hexanes) yields 30.4\u201331.7 g of 1-chloro-1-[(dimethyl)phenylsilyl]hexane (71\u201374% from hexanal) as a colorless oil (Note 6)",
            "B. 6-Methyl-6-dodecene. An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a condenser, a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum. The flask is purged with argon and charged with 96.23 g (373 mmol) of magnesium bromide etherate (MgBr2\u00b7Et2O) (Note 2) and 250 mL of dry THF. A total of 26.67 g (682 mmol) of potassium metal, freshly rinsed with 60 mL of dry THF, is added piecewise (Note 7). The reaction mixture is heated at reflux with stirring for 3 hr, at which time the activated magnesium has formed as a finely divided black powder (Note 8). The activated magnesium is allowed to cool and settle. The supernatant THF layer is carefully transferred via cannula into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 250 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The activated magnesium is rinsed with dry diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 200-mL) and diluted with 100 mL of dry diethyl ether all via cannula. The crude 1-chloro-1-[(dimethyl)phenylsilyl]hexane (31.58 g, 124 mmol) is diluted with 100 mL of dry diethyl ether and transferred via cannula to the addition funnel. The ethereal solution of the \u03b1-silyl chloride is added to the activated magnesium slurry in diethyl ether slowly in portions causing the reaction mixture to reflux gently (Note 9). Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min (Note 10).\nAn oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 25.61 g of copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (124 mmol) and 250 mL of dry diethyl ether, and the resulting slurry is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. The Grignard reagent solution prepared above is added to the copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide slurry via cannula (Note 11). The residual activated magnesium is rinsed once with 200 mL of dry diethyl ether, and the supernatant layer is transferred via cannula to the copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide slurry (Note 12). The reaction mixture is slowly warmed to \u221210\u00b0C, and then 16.78 g (17.42 mL, 125 mmol) of hexanoyl chloride is added dropwise via syringe after which the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature. After stirring for 3 hr, the reaction mixture is filtered through a 75-g layer of Celite 545 (Note 13) and the filter cake rinsed with three 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure yields the \u03b1-silyl ketone which is utilized without further purification (Note 14).\n(1) Acidic Elimination:\nAn oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum, and the system is purged with argon. The flask is charged with the crude \u03b1-silyl ketone prepared above and 500 mL of dry THF. Via cannula, a 125-mL (175 mmol) portion of a 1.4 M solution of methyllithium in hexanes is transferred to the addition funnel . After the \u03b1-silyl ketone solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath, the methyllithium solution is added dropwise over approximately 1 hr, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr at \u221278\u00b0C. A second, oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum. The second flask is charged with 47.39 g (249 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and 100 mL of dry THF, and purged with argon. The \u03b2-alkoxysilane solution prepared above is transferred to the flask containing the solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in THF via cannula and stirred for 2 hr. The reaction mixture is then poured into a separatory funnel containing a biphasic mixture of 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 250 mL of diethyl ether. The resulting organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 \u00d7 250-mL) and brine (250 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue via flash column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 450 g, eluant hexanes) yields 11.31\u201311.75 g of (Z)-6-methyl-6-dodecene (50\u201352% from the \u03b1-silyl chloride) as a 92:8 Z/E ratio of isomers (Note 15) and (Note 16).\n(2) Basic Elimination:\nAn oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum. The flask is purged with argon and is charged with the crude \u03b1-silyl ketone (from 30.00 g, 118 mmol of \u03b1-silyl chloride) and dry THF (500 mL). Methyllithium (1.4 M, 118 mL, 165 mmol) is added to the addition funnel via cannula. The \u03b1-silyl ketone solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and methyllithium is added dropwise over approximately 1 hr after which the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr. A second, oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is charged with 27 g of potassium hydride (35% wt/wt dispersion in oil which is rinsed with three 100-mL portions of dry diethyl ether), and diluted with 100 mL of dry THF, and 0.200 g of 18-crown-6 (0.76 mmol) is added. The \u03b2-alkoxysilane solution prepared above is added to the potassium hydride slurry via cannula, and the mixture is stirred for 16 hr. Excess potassium hydride is quenched with isopropyl alcohol (~50 mL) until no further hydrogen gas is evolved (Note 17). Saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (250-mL) is added to the reaction mixture which is then combined with 250 mL of diethyl ether in a separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed successively with three 250-mL portions of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 250 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue via flash column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 450 g, eluant hexanes) provides 11.19\u201311.62 g (E)-6-methyl-6-dodecene, (52\u201354% from the \u03b1-silyl chloride) as a 95:5 E/Z ratio of isomers (Note 15) and (Note 18)."

The flask is charged with 225 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 2) and 26.5 mL (0.189 mol) of diisopropylamine (Note 3), and then is cooled in an ice-water bath while 70.4 mL (0.178 mol) of a 2.53 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (Note 4) is added dropwise over 5\u201310 min. After 10 min, the resulting solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (Note 5) in a dry ice-acetone bath and a solution of 45.0 g (0.17 mol) of S-phenyl decanoate (Note 6) in 75 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over 1 hr (the dropping funnel is washed with two 5-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran). The yellow reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C, and then 18.2 mL (0.17 mol) of 3-methyl-2-butanone (Note 7) is added via a syringe pump or funnel over 7.5 min (Note 8). After 30 min, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually to 0\u00b0C over 1.5 hr (Note 9) and then is quenched by the addition of 225 mL of a half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution.

The combined organic layers are washed successively with three 200-mL portions of aqueous 10% sodium carbonate and 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to afford 41.5 g of the \u03b2-lactone as a yellow oil which is used in the next step without further purification (Note 10).\nA 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter, is charged with the 41.5 g of crude \u03b2-lactone prepared above, 200 mL of cyclohexane (Note 11), and 41.5 g of 230-400 mesh silica gel (Note 12). The resulting yellow mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr (water may be observed collecting in the condenser) and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Activated charcoal (6 g) is added (Note 13), and the resulting mixture is stirred for 5 min and filtered. The residue is washed with an additional 50 mL of cyclohexane and the combined filtrates are concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to afford 31.5 g of a yellow oil.

After being stirred at 0\u00b0C for 20 min, 41 g (0.63 mol) of zinc dust (Note 13) is added to the reaction mixture at 0\u00b0C in five portions in such a manner that the temperature remains at 0\u00b0C (Note 14), followed by addition of 0.88 g (3.2 mmol) of lead (II) chloride (Note 13) and (Note 15), and then the resulting suspension is warmed to 25\u00b0C. The color of the suspension turns from brownish yellow to dark greenish blue while being stirred at 25\u00b0C for 30 min. The addition funnel is then charged by syringe with a solution of 11 g (70 mmol) of ethyl benzoate (Note 12) and 35 g (0.15 mol) of 1,1-dibromopentane (part A) in 100 mL of dry THF. The resulting solution is then added to the stirred reaction mixture over a period of 10 min at 25\u00b0C and stirring is continued for 3.5\u20134.5 hr. The color of the resulting mixture gradually turns dark brown as the reaction proceeds (Note 16),(Note 17),(Note 18). The reaction mixture is then cooled to 0\u00b0C and 70 mL of triethylamine (Note 12) and 91 mL of saturated aqueous potassium carbonate solution are successively added slowly at 0\u00b0C by syringe. After stirring at 0\u00b0C for an additional 15 min, 200 mL of ether-triethylamine (200/1, v/v) is added to the reaction mixture. The entire reaction mixture is then passed rapidly through a thin pad of activity III basic alumina (Note 19) on a 1-L glass filter using 500 mL of ether-triethylamine (200/1, v/v) as eluent. The filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator (25\u00b0C, water bath). If a white solid appears at this point, the mixture is diluted with 100 mL of hexane-triethylamine (200/1, v/v) and the mixture is again filtered through a thin pad of basic alumina (Akt. III). The pad is washed with 100 mL of hexane-triethylamine (200/1, v/v) and the total eluent is concentrated again with a rotary evaporator. The resulting crude material is then vacuum distilled to give 11.0\u201311.4 g (77\u201380%) of a 93:7 mixture of (Z)- and (E)-1-ethoxy-1-phenyl-1-hexene, bp 73\u201375\u00b0C (0.20 mm) (Note 20) and (Note 21)."

A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride-filled drying tube, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 113.5 g (0.52 mol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Note 1) and 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran. Through the dropping funnel, 59.6 g (0.50 mol) of indoline is added to the reaction mixture with stirring over 30 min which maintains a steady evolution of carbon dioxide(Note 2). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr followed by removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to give 107.6\u2013107.8 g of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)indoline (98% yield) as a colorless oil, bp 83\u201384\u00b0C at 0.1 mm, which on standing solidifies, mp 42\u201345\u00b0C (Note 3).",
            "B. 1-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-7-indolinecarboxaldehyde. An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an argon inlet, 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum, a low temperature thermometer, and a 4.5-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar (Note 4), is flushed with argon and charged with 32.9 g (0.15 mol) of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)indoline, 27.2 mL (0.18 mol) of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) (Note 5), and 750 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 6). The dropping funnel is charged with 167 mL (0.18 mol) of a 1.08 M solution of sec-butyllithium in cyclohexane via syringe (Note 7). Under a positive pressure of argon, the flask is immersed in a dry ice-acetone bath. When the internal temperature has reached ca. \u221270\u00b0C, a white precipitate of the starting material appears. The solution of sec-butyllithium is added dropwise to this suspension with rapid stirring over 30 min while keeping the internal temperature below \u221270\u00b0C. The dropping funnel is rinsed with 10 mL of anhydrous ether. The light brown mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, during which time the precipitate completely dissolves and the color of the reaction mixture becomes deep brown. After the 2 hr has elapsed, 17.0 mL (0.22 mol) of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is added dropwise through the addition funnel over a 10-min period (Note 8). After stirring the resulting mixture for 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C, 50 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added through the dropping funnel over 15 min, and the cooling bath is removed (Note 9). When the internal temperature of the reaction mixture has reached \u221250\u00b0C, 50 mL of water is added dropwise, whereupon the deep orange color becomes light yellow. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C and then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing water (200 mL). After thorough mixing, the layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed twice with 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator followed by exposure to oil pump vacuum to remove as much of the volatiles as possible. The residue is chromatographed on 750 g of silica gel (Note 10), using a carefully packed 8-cm diameter glass column, and a mixture of toluene and ethyl acetate (30:1) as the eluent (Note 11). The appropriate fractions are combined and concentrated to give crude 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-7-indolinecarboxaldehyde (23.6\u201325.5 g, 64\u201369% yield) as a light yellow solid.

            "C. 7-Indolinecarboxaldehyde. A 300-mL Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 150 mL of concentrated (36%) hydrochloric acid. To this magnetically stirred solution, 19.8 g (0.08 mol) of finely powdered 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-7-indolinecarboxaldehyde is added portionwise over 15 min at room temperature. The starting material gradually dissolves accompanied by gas evolution. After 2 hr, the resulting orange-colored solution is poured into a 2-L beaker containing crushed ice (500 g). To this mixture, 120 mL of 28% aqueous ammonia solution is added slowly with stirring, and the resulting mixture containing a yellow precipitate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with four 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting yellowish brown oil is passed through 300 g of silica gel (Note 10) packed in an 8-cm diameter glass column using a mixture of toluene and ethyl acetate (30:1) as an eluent.

The resulting mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath. As a single portion, 71.0 g (0.5 mol) of solid phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) is added with stirring (Note 4). The resulting mixture, which becomes quite viscous because of the insoluble P2O5, is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 10 min, then warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 7 hr during which time the viscosity of the mixture decreases. The mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, 200 mL of water is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted three times with 50 mL of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed successively with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and carefully concentrated with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (20\u201330 mm) at room temperature. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 131.3 g (78%) of 2-bromoethyl methoxymethyl ether as a colorless liquid, bp 74\u201378\u00b0C (40 mm) (Note 5).",

The flask is charged with 74.2 g (440 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methoxymethyl ether, 58 g (880 mmol) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets (Note 7), and 7.09 g (2.2 mmol) of tris[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]amine (TDA-1) (Note 8). The mixture is heated to 140\u00b0C with stirring. The clear liquid phase gradually becomes cloudy and begins to reflux. After heating for 27 hr, consumption of the starting material is confirmed by GLC (Note 9). The calcium chloride tube is replaced with an additional cold trap that is attached to a water aspirator. The reaction mixture is cooled to 110\u00b0C and a vacuum is applied using the water aspirator for 2 hr, during which time volatile material is collected in the first cold trap. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the first trap is disconnected and allowed to warm to room temperature. The liquid is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask.

The flask is evacuated, purged with nitrogen, and charged with 200 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 11) and 8.83 g of methoxymethyl vinyl ether (100 mmol). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and then 88.7 mL (100 mmol) of sec-butyllithium (1.13 M in cyclohexane) is added dropwise over 15 min with stirring via syringe. After the addition is complete, the yellow mixture is allowed to warm to \u221230\u00b0C over 30 min and stir for 1 hr. The mixture is recooled to \u221278\u00b0C and 11.44 g (100 mmol) of heptanal is added dropwise over 5 min through the dropping funnel.

            "D. 2-Methoxymethoxy-1,3-nonanediol. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a three-way stopcock connected to a bubbler as above and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 14.79 g (73.1 mmol) of 2-methoxymethoxy-1-nonen-3-ol (Note 6). The flask is evacuated, then purged with nitrogen, and charged with 350 mL of dry diethyl ether and 8.88 g (87.7 mmol) of triethylamine (Note 13). After the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, 8.30 g (87.7 mmol) of chlorodimethylsilane is added slowly with stirring. A large quantity of salt appears immediately. The white suspension is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The resulting mixture is then filtered through a sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel and the filter cake is washed thoroughly with dry hexane (Note 14). The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Some salts usually remain in the residue and are removed by dilution of the residue with an additional 50 mL of dry hexane followed by filtration, washing the filter cake with hexane, and concentration of the combined filtrate and washings as above. This procedure for removal of salts is repeated two to three times until the colorless residual liquid remains clear after concentration (Note 15). The residual liquid is finally subjected to high vacuum (0.4 mm) for 2 hr to complete removal of volatile material, and then transferred to a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a three-way stopcock and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is evacuated, purged with nitrogen, and charged with 73 mL of dry hexane. To this mixture is added 1.21 mL (0.35 mmol) of the previously prepared platinum catalyst solution (Note 16) at room temperature with stirring. An exothermic reaction ensues almost immediately and the temperature of the mixture rises to about 30\u00b0C in 15 min, during which time the color of the clear mixture changes to yellow. The exothermic reaction ceases in about 1 hr. After the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 1.5 hr at room temperature, completion of the reaction is confirmed by analysis by 1H NMR (Note 17). A 7.3-g portion of activated carbon powder is then added to the lightly colored mixture to effect removal of organoplatinum species (Note 18). The black suspension is stirred for about 12 hr, and suction filtered through Celite into a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is washed with dry hexane, and the combined filtrate and washings are concentrated by rotary evaporation (Note 19). The flask containing the residue is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a thermometer, and is kept open to the air throughout subsequent manipulations. The flask is charged with 73 mL of THF, 73 mL of methanol (Note 20), 7.32 g (73.1 mmol) of solid potassium hydrogen carbonate, and 8.5 g (146 mmol) of solid potassium fluoride (Note 21). To the stirred mixture is added 29.7 mL (263 mmol) of 30% hydrogen peroxide slowly at room temperature (Note 22). A somewhat cloudy upper organic layer and a milky white lower aqueous layer result. After several minutes, an exothermic reaction begins which is controlled by intermittent, brief cooling with a water bath to maintain the temperature at about 40\u00b0C. The exothermic reaction ceases in about 2 hr. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr (Note 23). The excess hydrogen peroxide is decomposed by careful dropwise addition of a 50% aqueous sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate solution (~20 mL) with stirring over 20 min during which time the temperature is maintained near 30\u00b0C by intermittent cooling with an ice bath (Note 24). A negative starch-iodide test is observed after addition is complete (Note 25). The mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporator at 40\u201350\u00b0C under reduced pressure (water aspirator). To the residual aqueous suspension is added 150 mL of anhydrous ethanol and the mixture is stirred vigorously until the sticky, pale yellow precipitate becomes granular. The mixture is concentrated as above to give a pale yellow solid. The ethanol addition and evaporation procedure is repeated once more to insure thorough removal of water. The residue is then diluted with 150 mL of diethyl ether, the mixture is filtered with suction, and the filter cake is washed well with two 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual, crude product is purified by chromatography on 250 g of silica gel with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) as eluent to give 9.34\u201310.62 g (58\u201366%) of 2-methoxymethoxy-1,3-nonanediol (Rf = 0.2) as a colorless liquid (Note 26). The syn and anti isomers cannot be separated by column chromatography. However, separation can be effected by GLC which showed the isomer ratio to be 98:2 syn/anti (Note 27)."

The flask is charged with 3.00 g of (1R,2S,5R)-(\u2212)-menthol (19.2 mmol), 12.9 g of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (77.2 mmol), 20.1 g of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (76.6 mmol) (Note 1), and 150 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 12.1 mL of diethyl azodicarboxylate (77 mmol) is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained below 10\u00b0C (Note 3). Upon completion of the addition (Note 4), the flask is removed from the ice bath and the solution is allowed to stir at room temperature overnight (14 hr) and subsequently at 40\u00b0C for 3 hr (Note 5). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, diluted with 150 mL of ether, and washed twice with 100 mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layers are combined and back-extracted with 100 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate. Excess solvent and other volatile reaction components are completely removed under reduced pressure initially on a rotary evaporator and then under high vacuum (approximately 0.2 mm for 3 hr at 30\u00b0C) (Note 6). The resulting semi-solid is suspended in 40 mL of ether and the suspension is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (Note 7). The mixture is stirred while 20 mL of hexanes is slowly added (Note 8). The resulting white solid is filtered under vacuum and the filter cake is washed with 200 mL of 50% (v/v) ether-hexanes. The solvent is removed from the filtrate on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil that is dissolved in 10 mL of methylene chloride (Note 9) and diluted with 40 mL of 8% ether-hexanes. The solution is applied to a flash chromatography column (Note 10) and eluted with 8% ether-hexanes to give 5.03 g (85.6%) of pure nitrobenzoate ester as a white crystalline solid (Note 11)."

The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, magnetic stirring is initiated, and 58.0 mL (0.055 mol) of 0.95 M borane-tetrahydrofuran solution (Note 4) is added via syringe at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below 5\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stir for 2 hr to ensure complete reaction.2",
            "B. (+)-Isopinocampheol. To the stirred solution of (+)-diisopinocampheylborane in tetrahydrofuran, prepared above, 50 mL of distilled water is slowly added dropwise via syringe [CAUTION!] (Note 5) followed by the slow addition of 16.41 g (0.107 mol) of solid sodium perborate tetrahydrate (Note 6) through an appropriate addition funnel at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 35\u00b0C (Note 7). Stirring is continued at room temperature (22\u00b0C) for 2 hr to ensure completion of the oxidation reaction. The contents of the flask are then poured into 70 mL of ice-cold water in a separatory funnel. After thorough mixing, the organic layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 25 mL of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 20-mL portions of water and then with 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is purified by short-path vacuum distillation to give 14.1\u201314.3 g (91\u201392%) of isopinocampheol, bp 68\u00b0C (0.7 mm), as white needles (mp 53\u201355\u00b0C) that crystallize in the receiving flask (Note 8).

An oven-dried, 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and rubber septum is charged with 6.25 g (20 mmol) of 16-dehydroprogesterone (1) and 0.20 g (1.0 mmol) of cuprous bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (Note 1). After the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 7.7 mL (44 mmol) of hexamethylphosphoramide are added (Note 1). The resulting clear solution, upon cooling to \u221278\u00b0C, becomes a white slurry to which 5.1 mL (40 mmol) of chlorotrimethylsilane is added dropwise (Note 1). To the resulting yellow solution is added 23.7 mL (22 mmol) of a 0.93 M solution of methylmagnesium bromide in THF (Note 2) over a 30-min period. The resulting yellow slurry is then stirred at ~ \u221255 to \u221260\u00b0C (Note 3) for 12 hr followed by addition of 5.6 mL (40 mmol) of triethylamine dropwise (Note 1).

The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and 200 mL of methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) is added (Note 1). Quickly under nitrogen flow, the rubber septum is removed from the flask and 12.8 g (128 mmol) of finely powdered, dry potassium bicarbonate (Note 5) is added to the solution, and the flask is resealed with the rubber septum. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath.

TLC is used to monitor the progress of the reaction (Note 7). After stirring the reaction mixture for an additional 10 min after the addition is complete, the addition funnel, nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and rubber septum are removed and 100 mL of aqueous 0.5 M sodium thiosulfate solution is added, vigorous stirring is maintained at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture is then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50 mL of CH2Cl2. The combined organic extracts are concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 100 mL of THF, and the solution is acidified to ~ pH 1 by addition of 10 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) to effect desilylation of the 21-trimethylsilyl ether of 16\u03b1-methylcortexolone (6) (Note 8). The homogeneous solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min and then most of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 300 mL of CH2Cl2, transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel, and the solution washed with 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. After separation of the organic phase, the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50-mL portions of CH2Cl2. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 6.0 g of a white solid.

Stirring is initiated while the mixture is heated to 70\u00b0C using a heating mantle, and 22.1 mL (36.24 g, 0.304 mol) of thionyl chloride (Note 2) is added at a rate to maintain controlled reflux (Note 3). The required addition time is about 1 hr. The dark solution is heated an additional 2 hr at 70\u00b0C and cooled to 40\u00b0C (Note 4). While still warm (~40\u00b0C), the mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel, and the dark lower layer is separated from the hexane solution (Note 5). The hexane layer is cooled to 25\u00b0C and washed with 60 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 6). The bicarbonate wash is back extracted with 36 mL of hexane and the combined hexane layers are treated with 3 g of carbon (Note 7), (Note 8) and stirred for 2 hr at 25\u00b0C. The carbon is removed by filtration and the cake is washed with three portions (12-mL each) of hexane.

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical overhead stirrer is charged with the hexane solution from step A. To this solution is added a solution of 11.6 g (0.178 mol based on the total solids from the sulfonyl chlorides above) of sodium azide (NaN3) in 100 mL of water and 2.0 g of phase transfer catalyst (Aliquat 336) (Note 9). Stirring is initiated, and the reaction progress is monitored by thin layer chromatography (Note 10). Approximately 4 hr at 25\u00b0C is required to complete the reaction. The two-phase mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is removed. The hexane layer is washed with 100 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over 28 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration, and the cake is washed with 20 mL of hexane. The concentration and purity of the 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides are best determined by evaporation of a small sample to an oil of constant weight with visible spectrophotometric assay for the azide (Note 11). The hexane solution of dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides, when standardized as above (Note 11), can be used as obtained for most applications. However, if desired, careful concentration of the hexane solution under reduced pressure at room temperature affords 58.2\u201361.4 g (90\u201395%) of the oily mixture of dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides; corrected for the assay of the azides the yield is usually 95% (Note 12) and (Note 13)."

            "A. Bis(trifluoroethyl) methylphosphonate 1. All glassware is oven-dried. A 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, reflux condenser with a bubbler, and a 200-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a nitrogen inlet. Under a gentle flow of nitrogen, the flask is charged with 300 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1), 42 g (0.42 mol) of trifluoroethanol (Note 2), and 42.4 g of triethylamine (Note 2). Stirring is started, and the flask is immersed in a cool (~ 10\u00b0C) water bath. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 26.6 g (0.2 mol) of methylphosphonic dichloride (Note 3) in 100 mL of THF, that is subsequently added at a constant rate over 30 min. The internal temperature rises to 20\u201330\u00b0C, and a white solid precipitates. After the addition is complete, the water bath is removed, and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The organic salts are removed by suction filtration through a glass funnel, and the filter cake is washed with three 50-mL portions of THF. The solvent is completely removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 100 mL of dry ether and filtered to remove insoluble triethylamine hydrochloride, using an additional 40 mL of ether to aid the filtration/transfer. Solvent is again completely evaporated under reduced pressure. Crude product 1, thus obtained, is transferred to a 100-mL pear-shaped flask, fitted with a short distillation column (Note 4), and distilled under reduced pressure to afford 45.3\u201348.0 g (89\u201393%) of pure bis(trifluoroethyl) methylphosphonate (1) as a colorless liquid, bp 88\u201391\u00b0C (14 mm), which affords white crystals on standing in the freezer (Note 5). When sufficiently pure, 1 will crystallize on standing at room temperature.",
            "B. Bis(trifluoroethyl) (carboethoxymethyl)phosphonate (2). An oven-dried, 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted as above (Part A), flushed with nitrogen, and charged with 131 mL (0.210 mol) of a solution of butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane) (Note 6). The solution is cooled with stirring to approximately \u221220\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath, and the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 34 g (0.212 mol) of hexamethyldisilazane (Note 7) in 110 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1). The contents of the addition funnel are added dropwise over 15 min during which time the yellow color practically disappears. A fine white suspension forms when the resulting solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. A solution of 26 g (0.1 mol) of 1 and 11.5 g (0.106 mol) of ethyl chloroformate (Note 7) in 60 mL of THF is then added dropwise over 15 min via the addition funnel. During the course of the addition, the temperature rises to between \u221275\u00b0 and \u221265\u00b0C, and the solution becomes clear. The reaction mixture is stirred at \u221270\u00b0C for an additional 15 min; the flask containing the reaction mixture is securely stoppered and stored overnight at \u221220\u00b0C in a freezer (Note 8). The cold (\u221220\u00b0C) reaction mixture is poured into a stirred mixture of 170 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid and an equal volume of crushed ice, and 150 mL of methylene chloride. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 50 mL of methylene chloride (Note 9). The combined organic extracts are diluted with 200 mL of hexane to facilitate drying, and then dried for ~12 hr over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 10). After removal of the magnesium sulfate by filtration, the solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give crude 2 as a pale yellow liquid. Subsequent distillation of this crude material in a short path distillation apparatus (Note 11) under reduced pressure gives, after a small forerun (Note 12), 25.5\u201326.3 g (77\u201379%) of bis(trifluoroethyl) (carboethoxymethyl) phosphonate (2) as a colorless oil, bp 88\u201397\u00b0C (0.04 mm) (Note 13)."

In an oven-dried, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated stirring bar is placed 26.0 g (0.126 mol) of diethyl L-tartrate (Note 1). A pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 100 mL (0.504 mol) of 30% hydrobromic acid (HBr) in acetic acid (Note 2) is mounted on the flask and the top of the funnel is fitted with a nitrogen inlet vented through an oil bubbler. The system is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, magnetic stirring is initiated, and contents of the flask are cooled in an ice-water bath. The contents of the dropping funnel are added to the cooled tartrate during 30 min and the yellow mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min after completion of the addition. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to reach 25\u00b0C and stir for an additional 10 hr or until disappearance of the tartrate as judged by TLC analysis (Note 3). The light brown reaction mixture is poured into 500 g of ice, and the resulting mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted four times with 80 mL of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed successively three times with 60 mL of water, and then 100 mL of brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give a pale yellow oil.\nA single-necked, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and an efficient reflux condenser bearing a drying tube packed with blue indicator silica gel beads, is charged with the yellow oil obtained above and 140 mL of ethanol (Note 4) to which is cautiously added 4 mL of acetyl chloride with stirring (Note 5). The mixture is heated under gentle reflux for 7 hr, then cooled to room temperature, the condenser is removed, and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure at 50\u201360\u00b0C using a rotary evaporator to give a yellow oil. The crude product is transferred to a silica gel column (Note 6) with the aid of a small amount of hexane-ethyl acetate (4:1) and eluted with the same mixed solvent in 60-mL fractions. Fractions 5 to 15 (Note 7) are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a colorless oil, which, upon vacuum distillation, affords 24.36\u201325.73 g (72\u201376%) of 99% pure (GLC) diethyl (2S,3S)-2-bromo-3-hydroxysuccinate, bp 93\u201394\u00b0C (0.2 mm) [lit.2bp 123\u2013125\u00b0C (0.6 mm)], [\u03b1]25.6D \u221216.8\u00b0 (EtOH, c 5.70), [\u03b1]27D \u221235.72\u00b0 (neat) [lit.2[\u03b1]21D \u221228.9\u00b0 (neat)] (Note 8),(Note 9).",
            "B. Diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3). An oven-dried, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and a rubber septum through which is inserted a large bore, needle-tipped nitrogen line vented through an oil bubbler, is charged with 29.7 g (0.110 mol) of diethyl (2S,3S)-2-bromo-3-hydroxy succinate and 80 mL of dry ethanol (Note 10). In a separate, oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, capped with a rubber septum and vented though a bubbler as described above, a solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol is prepared from 3.05 g of sodium (0.132 mol) and 120 mL of dry ethanol (Note 10). (Caution: This operation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood. Sodium is a highly reactive metal, avoid exposure to moisture. Hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable and forms explosive mixtures with air, is rapidly evolved. External cooling may be necessary.) The two flasks are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and connected by means of a long double needle-tipped cannula. Magnetic stirring is initiated, and the ethanolic solution of the succinate 2 is cooled in an ice-water bath for 15 min followed by dropwise addition of the solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol which is transferred via the cannula under a very slight positive pressure of nitrogen (Note 11). Complete transfer of the base should require 2 hr (Note 12). The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0\u201310\u00b0C (bath temperature) and then quenched by the addition of 1.43 mL (0.025 mol) of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is diluted with 900 mL of water, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and extracted four times with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are washed with 100 mL of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give a colorless oil.

The open needle is removed and the flask is charged with a solution of 3.45 g (0.0282 mol) of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) in 17 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Note 16) and (Note 17) and 1.93 mL (0.0329 mol) of dry ethanol (Note 11) through the septum via syringe. Stirring is initiated and the mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath. To this cold solution is added 17.1 mL (0.122 mol) of azidotrimethylsilane (Note 18) dropwise at 0\u00b0C by means of a syringe (Note 19). The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 15 min at room temperature (25\u00b0C) and then a solution of 17.7 g (0.0940 mol) of diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3) in 50 mL of chloroform (Note 20), prepared in a septum-capped, oven-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, is rapidly transferred via cannula with the aid of a positive nitrogen pressure as above (Part B). The mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C until epoxide 3 can no longer be detected upon TLC analysis of the reaction mixture (~40 hr). The mixture is then diluted with 300 mL of water, transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the organic phase separated. The aqueous phase is extracted four times with 60 mL of a hexane-ether mixture (1:1 v/v). The combined organic phases are added to 20 mL of a magnetically stirred 2.3 N solution of hydrogen chloride in ethanol (Note 21), followed by dilution of the resulting mixture with an additional 50 mL of ethanol and continued stirring at room temperature for 30 min (Note 22). After transfer to a separatory funnel, the solution is washed successively with four 50-mL portions of water, 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator followed by exposure to high vacuum affording 18.6 g (86%) of 96\u201398% pure diethyl (2S,3R)-2-azido-3-hydroxysuccinate (4) as a pale yellow oil, [\u03b1]20D +31.8\u00b0 (EtOH, c 18.1), as judged by NMR analysis (Note 23) and (Note 24).

            "D. Diethyl (2S,3R)-2-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino-3-hydroxysuccinate (5). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar, is charged with a suspension of 0.91 g of 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (Note 25) in 100 mL of ethyl acetate (Note 26). The flask is connected to a normal pressure hydrogenation apparatus (Note 27) and the catalyst is saturated with hydrogen. After removal of the hydrogen, a solution of 18.2 g (0.0785 mol) of 4 and 20.6 g (0.0942 mol) di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Note 28) in 80 mL of ethyl acetate (Note 26) is added to the suspension of catalyst, a hydrogen atmosphere reestablished, and the suspension is stirred at room temperature under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen for 4\u20136 hr (Note 29). The suspension is filtered through a Celite pad, and the pad is rinsed with several portions of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate solutions are concentrated on a rotary evaporator and finally under high vacuum to give a pale yellow oil that is initially purified by means of a column packed with silica gel (100 g) using hexane-ethyl acetate (6:1) as eluent (Note 30). Fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give 23.3 g of crude 5 as a colorless oil. The oily crude 5 is dissolved in 70 mL of hexane-ether (3:1), and the solution is cooled to \u221230\u00b0C, seeded, and kept overnight at that temperature (freezer) to allow crystallization (Note 31). The mother liquor is siphoned out while the mixture is kept at \u221230\u00b0C (dry ice-acetone bath). The crystals are washed with several portions of hexane-ether (3:1) at \u221230\u00b0C, then dried under high vacuum to provide 12.2\u201312.7 g of diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure diethyl (2S,3R)-2-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino-3-hydroxysuccinate (5) as colorless prisms, mp 33\u201334\u00b0C; [\u03b1]24D +13.1\u00b0 (EtOH, c 6.32); [\u03b1]24D +28.7\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 6.05) (Note 32). The combined mother liquor and the hexane\u2013ether (3:1) washings are concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a colorless oil, which upon crystallization as above provides an additional 2.7\u20133.8 g of product 5 (Note 33). The combined yield of crystalline 5 is 15.9\u201316.5 g (66\u201373%)."

A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 34.4 g (246 mmol) of hexamethylenetetramine and 500 mL of chloroform (CHCl3) (Note 1). cis-1,4-Dichlorobut-2-ene (30.2 g, 242 mmol) is added, the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser (Note 2), and the mixture is heated to reflux with a heating mantle. After 4 hr, the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and filtered through a sintered glass funnel (10\u201320 \u03bc porosity). The resulting white solid, quaternary salt 2, is washed with two 100-mL portions of CHCl3, and the filtrate is heated to reflux for an additional 18 hr, cooled, and filtered. The resulting light brown solid 2 is washed twice with 50-mL portions of CHCl3. The combined solids are dried in a desiccator under reduced pressure (1 mm) to afford 58.6 g (91%) of 2 (Note 3).",
            "B. (Z)-4-Chloro-2-butenylammonium chloride (3). A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring, is charged with 400 mL of 95% ethanol (EtOH) and 70 mL of concd hydrochloric acid (HCl) is slowly added (slightly exothermic reaction). To the still warm solution is added solid 2 (58.5 g, 221 mmol) in one portion. The reaction initially becomes homogeneous and slightly orange colored, then after 45 min a precipitate begins to form. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature for 18 hr, cooled to 0\u00b0C, and the precipitate (NH4Cl) is collected by filtration using a 10\u201320 \u03bc porosity sintered glass funnel. The collected solid is washed on the funnel twice with 100 mL of cold 95% EtOH. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation, and the remaining semisolid is taken up in 40 mL of cold 95% EtOH. The resulting precipitate (NH4Cl) is again collected on the filter and washed with cold 95% EtOH (2 \u00d7 20 mL). This procedure (rotary evaporation, solution in 95% EtOH, cooling, filtration) is repeated once more.\nThe solid remaining upon concentration of the filtrate from the final filtration is dissolved in 80 mL of warm ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Upon cooling, the product crystallizes. Hexane is added (30 mL) and the crystals are collected on a 10\u201320 \u03bc porosity sintered-glass funnel. The solid is washed with 60 mL of hexane. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation to give an additional amount of solid that is recrystallized from a minimum amount of EtOAc and hexane as before. The combined solids are dried in a desiccator under reduced pressure (1 mm) for 2 hr to give 28.1\u201330.4 g (90\u201396%) of 3 as a light yellow crystalline solid (Note 4).",

Toward the end of the addition, the resulting slurry becomes orange, gas is evolved, and mixture begins to reflux (the reaction is exothermic). Any remaining salt 3 is added, and, when boiling subsides, a short-path distillation head wrapped in glass wool is put in place (Note 5). A 50-mL receiving flask is totally immersed in a \u221278\u00b0C bath (dry ice-isopropyl alcohol). The orange solid mixture is heated using a heating mantle during which time the solid liquifies and 3-pyrroline (4) distills at 85\u201392\u00b0C at atmospheric pressure. ( CAUTION: some foaming occurs initially, but subsides during the reaction). Heating is continued until no more 3-pyrroline distills, affording 11.05 g (75%) of 3-pyrroline as a clear oil (Note 6), (Note 7)."

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer, is charged with 108.1 g (1.0 mol) of 1,4-benzoquinone (Note 1) and 350 mL of dichloromethane (Note 2). The flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath. Via the addition funnel, 41.5 mL of cyclopentadiene (34.2 g, 0.52 mol) (Note 3) is added dropwise over a 45-min period with stirring at such a rate that the internal temperature remains below 8\u00b0C (Note 4). A second 41.5-mL portion (34.2 g, 0.52 mol) of cyclopentadiene is added in a similar way (Note 5). The resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hr in the ice bath, for 0.5 hr at room temperature, and then is transferred to a 1-L, pear-shaped flask by rinsing with a small amount of dichloromethane. Most of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, and 200 mL of hexane is added to the residue. The flask is cooled in an ice bath for 0.5 hr. The pale yellow solids are collected by suction filtration, washed with three 30-mL portions of hexane, and air-dried to afford 150\u2013155 g of the Diels-Alder adduct 1 (D-A adduct) of sufficient purity for use in the next step (Note 6). Concentration of the filtrate to about half the volume and cooling affords 12\u201315 g of a second crop of 1. The combined yield of 1 is 164\u2013169 g (94\u201397%).",
            "B. endo-Tricyclo[6.2.1.02,7]undec-9-ene-3,6-dione 2. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and heating mantle, is charged with 166 g (0.95 mol) of the crude D-A adduct 1 and 1.3 L of acetic acid (Note 7). Portionwise, 228.8 g (3.5 mol) of zinc dust (Note 8) is added to the mixture with stirring. The temperature rises to about 70\u00b0C over a 10-min period and then drops. The resulting mixture is then heated at 70\u201380\u00b0C for 1 hr, followed by addition of a further 32.7 g (0.5 mol) of zinc powder and continued heating and stirring for an additional 1.5 hr. After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, the gray solids are collected by suction filtration, and washed with 200 mL of acetic acid (Note 9). The dark yellowish filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (Note 10), the residue diluted with 600 mL of water, and the resulting mixture extracted with three 300-mL portions of toluene (Note 11). The combined toluene extracts are washed with two 100-mL portions of water, 100 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution, two 100-mL portions of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. Removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure yields 148\u2013155 g of crude diketone 2, sufficiently pure for further transformation, as a reddish liquid that solidifies on cooling (Note 12).",
            "C. 2-Cyclohexene-1,4-dione 3 (Note 13) and (Note 14). The 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing ~150 g of crude diketone 2 from Part B is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a Claisen-type short path distillation head leading to a condenser and a 200-mL, round-bottomed receiver. Two cold traps are placed between the receiver and a vacuum pump. The first trap is cooled in a dry ice-ethanol bath and the second trap in liquid nitrogen (Note 15). The system is evacuated and the distillation pot is placed in an oil bath and heated rapidly to 140\u2013180\u00b0C with magnetic stirring, whereupon diketone 2 distills fairly rapidly into the receiver to afford a mixture of diketone 2 and 2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione 3, bp 80\u2013140\u00b0C (most at 130\u2013140\u00b0C) at 4\u20137 mm (bath temperature 140\u2013180\u00b0C), as a pale yellow oil (Note 16), (Note 17) and (Note 18).\nThe 200-mL, round-bottomed receiver, containing a mixture of diketone 2 and 2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione 3, is then fitted with a long path (25 cm) distillation head packed with Pyrex glass helices or chips, an air condenser (25 cm), and a 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed receiver with one neck connected to the vacuum pump via the traps described earlier. The distillation pot is placed in an oil bath, the system is evacuated, and the receiver is immersed in an ice bath. The bath is heated to 120\u00b0C and the mixture of diketone 2 and 2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione 3 is redistilled at 4\u20138 mm while the bath temperature is gradually increased from 120\u00b0C to 190\u00b0C. Early in the distillation, the enedione 3, which is already present, distills smoothly, then the rate of dissociation of 2 becomes rate-determining. The bath temperature is maintained at 180\u2013190\u00b0C so as to keep the boiling point nearly constant (87\u00b0C/6 mm). Care is taken to assure that any enedione 3 that crystallizes in the condenser or receiver is quickly melted with an efficient heat gun to avoid occlusion of the distillation path (Note 19). A total of 73\u201380 g of crude yellow solid enedione 3 is obtained containing a small amount of diketone 2.\nThe resulting crude solid enedione 3 is melted at 60\u201370\u00b0C in a water bath and 35 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added (Note 20). The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, 18 mL of hexane is added (Note 21), and the resulting mixture is gently stirred with a glass rod. After cooling for 20\u201330 min, the resulting pale yellow crystals are collected by suction filtration, washed with 20\u201330 mL of a cold mixture of carbon tetrachloride and hexane (1:1 v/v), and then with 40 mL of hexane. Brief air drying affords 65\u201371 g of almost pure enedione 3, mp 54\u201354.5\u00b0C (Note 21) and (Note 22). Concentration of the filtrate to about 15 mL, addition of 8 mL of hexane, and cooling the mixture furnishes a further 1.5\u20132.5 g of 3. In total, 67.0\u201372.5 g (61\u201366% from 1,4-benzoquinone) of nearly pure 3 is obtained (Note 23), (Note 24) and (Note 25)."

The system is flushed with argon, cooled to 0\u00b0C by means of an ice bath, and the brown reaction mixture is stirred well for several minutes (Note 3). Separately, a dry, 100-mL, graduated cylinder bearing a standard taper ground joint with an argon inlet/outlet, is purged with nitrogen and charged with 25 mL (0.32 mol) of DMF. The DMF is cooled in crushed ice and agitated by hand during the cautious addition of 25 mL (0.27 mol) of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 4). The resulting viscous, red complex is transferred to the dropping funnel and added to the magnetically stirred mixture of acetylferrocene and DMF dropwise over 30 min (Note 5). Complete addition is assured by washing the addition funnel and walls of the flask with a small amount of DMF using a pipette. The mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 2 hr during which time the color of the reaction mixture changes from dark brown to olive and ultimately to deep blue. Prior to neutralization, the dropping funnel is replaced by a reflux condenser (Note 6). A 75-mL portion of diethyl ether is added, and the viscous mixture is stirred vigorously for several minutes (Note 7).\nUnder a positive pressure of argon with continued ice cooling, 116 g (0.85 mol) of sodium acetate trihydrate is cautiously added to the reaction mixture in one portion through a powder funnel followed by cautious addition of 10 mL of water with vigorous stirring (Note 8). The ice bath is removed whereupon the organic layer undergoes a striking color change from colorless to ruby red indicating the formation of the formyl derivative. After 1 hr, an additional 10 mL of ether is added, and stirring is continued for 3 hr at room temperature to ensure complete quenching. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel with ether and water and mixed thoroughly, and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted several times with 100-mL portions of ether (Note 9). The combined organic phases are carefully washed twice with 100-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (CAUTION: gas evolution) and then with 100 mL of water (Note 10). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator affording 23.4\u201325.6 g (85\u201393%) of (2-formyl-1-chlorovinyl)ferrocene (homogeneous by TLC analysis) as deep purple crystals (mp 76\u201377\u00b0C) after drying under high vacuum (Note 11).\nEthynylferrocene: A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, and inlet/outlet valves for maintenance of an inert atmosphere as described above, is flushed with argon, charged with 26.0 g (95.0 mmol) of (2-formyl-1-chlorovinyl)ferrocene and 300 mL of anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (Note 12), and the apparatus is placed in an oil bath. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux and after 5 min at reflux, 250 mL of a boiling 1 N solution of sodium hydroxide (a 2.5-fold excess) is cautiously added as rapidly as possible in one portion (Note 13), and the mixture is heated at reflux for another 25 min (Note 14). The oil bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature.\nThe reaction mixture is cautiously poured into ice and neutralized with 1 N hydrochloric acid. After transfer to a 1-L separatory funnel, the aqueous mixture is extracted five times with 100 mL of hexane (Note 15). After the combined organic extracts are successively washed twice with 100-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and water, the organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator affording an orange residue of crude ethynylferrocene. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography (Silica G-60, 5 \u00d7 15 cm column) with elution by hexane (Note 16). Concentration of the fractions containing the product and drying under high vacuum affords 14.8\u201315.0 g (74\u201375%) of pure ethynylferrocene which crystallizes as an orange solid, mp 53\u00b0C (lit.2 52\u201353.5\u00b0C) upon seeding (Note 17)."

To avoid water condensing on the surfaces, N2 should be allowed to flow through the flask and out of the dropping funnel while the glassware is still hot. While the dropping funnel is temporarily removed, the flask is charged with 23.0 g of sodium shavings (1.0 mol) (Note 3) via a solids addition funnel (Note 4) and (Note 5) and, after reassembly, the apparatus is flushed with N2 for 5 min and placed in an ice-water bath. Carbon disulfide (CS2, 180 mL, 3.0 mol) (Note 6) is introduced into the flask through the dropping funnel, after which the dropping funnel is immediately loaded with 200 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) (Note 7), the system is closed, and the N2 atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction by adjusting the Firestone valve to a slightly positive pressure (Note 8). The DMF is added dropwise with stirring over 4 hr during which a red color appears (after addition of several mL of DMF). During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained with ice-water cooling. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight, during which time it becomes increasingly deep red/violet. The reaction mixture is visually inspected for residual sodium (Note 9). As a precaution, ice is added to the cooling bath and 50 mL of methanol is added slowly through the dropping funnel (Note 9). A mixture of 400 mL methanol and 500 mL of deionized water, which is degassed by applying vacuum, is then added rapidly through the dropping funnel. A solution of 20 g (0.15 mol) of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) in a mixture of 500 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide and 500 mL of methanol is then added through the dropping funnel (Note 10). A solution of 53 g (0.25 mol) of tetraethylammonium bromide in 250 mL of deionized water is added dropwise via the dropping funnel with vigorous stirring over at least 4 hr, and the solution is stirred overnight. A large amount of red precipitate develops in the flask overnight. This salt is collected by suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed immediately with 500 mL of deionized water, then with 400-mL portions of isopropyl alcohol until the filtrate is colorless, and finally once with 200 mL of diethyl ether. The product is then dried in a desiccator under vacuum affording 74\u201376 g (83\u201384%) of zincate 2 as a red powder.

            "A. Diethyl (\u2212)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Dean-Stark trap is charged with 103 g (500 mmol) of diethyl L-tartrate (Note 1), 53.1 g (500 mmol) of benzaldehyde (Note 2), 600 mL of cyclohexane and 2.80 g (14.7 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 3). The stirred mixture is heated with azeotropic removal of water (Note 4). The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and then is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mm, 30\u00b0C). The residual yellow oil is dissolved in 400 mL of diethyl ether (Note 5), transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and washed with saturated aqueous potassium bicarbonate (200 mL) , and with water (2 \u00d7 200 mL). The ethereal layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mm, 30\u00b0C), followed by removal of solvent at 0.02 mm at room temperature. The solid crude product is collected by suction filtration through a sintered-glass funnel to give diethyl (\u2212)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate as yellow crystals. Trituration of the crude solid product with 150 mL of hexanes and collection of the purified product by suction filtration through a sintered-glass funnel gives 105 g (71%) of purified product, mp 47\u00b0C (Note 6).",
            "B. (+)-2-O-Benzyl-L-threitol.2 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is oven-dried (140\u00b0C) and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a reflux condenser equipped with a mineral oil bubbler that is connected to a nitrogen source. A slight pressure of gas is maintained in the apparatus throughout the course of the reaction. The flask is charged with 16.5 g (434 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride (Note 7), and cooled to \u221230\u00b0C using an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath. Then 167 mL of dry diethyl ether (Note 8) is added with vigorous stirring and a solution of 57.8 g (434 mmol) of aluminum chloride in 134 mL of dry diethyl ether (Note 8), (Note 9) is added dropwise during 40 min. Dry dichloromethane (134 mL) (Note 10) is placed in the addition funnel and added rapidly, while the temperature is allowed to rise to 0\u00b0C. A solution of 64.7 g (220 mmol) of diethyl (\u2212)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate in dry dichloromethane (134 mL) is added dropwise during 30 min (Note 11). The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and heated to reflux for an additional 2 hr. The mixture is cooled to \u221220\u00b0C as above, and 14 mL of de-ionized water, followed by a solution of 31.5 g (561 mmol) of potassium hydroxide in 46 mL of de-ionized water, is added cautiously. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature until the grey color (probably due to unreacted lithium aluminum hydride) has completely disappeared (Note 12). Efficient stirring is required throughout to ensure good yields. The mixture is filtered through a glass-sintered funnel containing a 2-cm pad of Celite, and the inorganic precipitate is extracted with 0.5 L of dichloromethane in a Soxhlet apparatus for 3 days. The combined extracts and filtrate are evaporated under reduced pressure (30 mm, 30\u00b0C). After drying over phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) in an evacuated (1 mm) desiccator, 42.4 g (91%) of colorless crystals, mp 71\u201373\u00b0C, are obtained and used as such for step C. Recrystallization from dichloromethane (Note 10) gives 37.4 g (80%) of (+)-2-O-benzyl-L-threitol, mp 75\u201376\u00b0C (Note 13).",
            "C. (\u2212)-2-O-Benzyl-L-glyceraldehyde.3 A solution of 9.22 g (43.4 mmol) of (+)-2-O-benzyl-L-threitol (Note 14) in 100 mL of water is stirred vigorously, while 9.28 g (43.4 mmol) of sodium periodate (Note 15) is added in ca. 1-g portions over 40 min. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, then the pH is adjusted to 7.0 by addition of solid potassium carbonate (Note 16). The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 15 min and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 mm, 30\u00b0C). The remaining pale-yellow crude oil is transferred to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and purified by short-path distillation in a preheated oil bath (0.025 mm, 160\u00b0C) (Note 17), to yield 6.32 g (80%) of (\u2212)-2-O-benzyl-L-glyceraldehyde, a colorless oil that on standing turns more and more viscous, and after several weeks at room temperature forms a waxy solid (Note 18).",
            "D. Ethyl (\u2212)-[R-(E)]-4-O-benzyl-4,5-dihydroxy-2-pentenoate. To a 500-mL, round-bottomed, two-necked flask, fitted with a nitrogen inlet (Note 19) and a stopper, is added 3.32 g of a suspension of sodium hydride in paraffin, containing 65% sodium hydride. The suspension is washed three times with 40 mL and once with 20 mL of hexanes (Note 20) to remove the paraffin. The residue is freed from remaining hexanes under vacuum (0.01 mm) to give ca. 2.16 g (ca. 90 mmol) of sodium hydride. The flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and the stopper is exchanged for a septum. Then 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 21) is added and the suspension is cooled to 0\u00b0C. Triethyl phosphonoacetate (22.87 g, 102 mmol) (Note 22) is added to the stirred sodium hydride/tetrahydrofuran suspension by means of a 50-mL syringe over a period of 20 min. The mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (acetone/dry ice) and a solution of 10.81 g (60 mmol) of (\u2212)-2-O-benzyl-L-glyceraldehyde in 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 21) is added by means of a syringe over 20 min. (The checkers transferred this solution via a cannula.) The mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min at \u221278\u00b0C. The temperature is allowed to rise to 0\u00b0C within 30 min, and finally is kept at room temperature for an additional 45 min. The reaction is quenched with 150 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted three times with ether (500, 200, 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with a mixture of saturated sodium bicarbonate/brine (1:1, 160 mL). The aqueous layer is washed with ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness to give a pale yellow oil. The crude product is purified by column chromatography over silica gel (Note 23) with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1/1 as eluent (Note 24), to yield 11.7 g (78%) of analytically pure ethyl (\u2212)-[R-(E)]-4-O-benzyl-4,5-dihydroxy-2-pentenoate (Note 25)."

The mineral oil is removed by washing with pentane (3 \u00d7 30 mL) and the potassium hydride is suspended in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 3). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and is connected to a Nujol-filled bubbler by means of a syringe needle. A solution of 12.0 g (76.8 mmol) of (\u2212)-menthol (Note 2) in 120 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is then added dropwise by syringe over 20 min. The mixture is stirred until hydrogen evolution is complete (ca. 20 min) and cooled to \u221250\u00b0C by means of an acetone-liquid nitrogen bath. A solution of trichloroethylene (7.58 mL, 84.4 mmol) (Note 3) in 75 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise by syringe over 15 min, after which the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 1 hr.

The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the resulting milky white suspension is heated to reflux for 2.5 hr. The suspension is cooled to room temperature, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure. To the residual off-white solids are added ether (800 mL) and deionized water (400 mL). The suspension is stirred until the solids are dissolved, and the resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The layers are partitioned, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (4 \u00d7 200 mL). The organic phases are combined, dried over K2CO3 (ca. 100 g), filtered, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure (Note 17) to afford 14.5\u201315.8 g (92\u2013100%) of the pure title compound as a white solid (Note 18)."

To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, magnetic stirrer, nitrogen/vacuum adapter, and a thermometer is added 39.9 mL (0.29 mol) of diisopropylamine and 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1), (Note 2). The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and 101.6 mL of butyllithium (2.55 M in hexane, 0.26 mol) is added slowly (Note 3). After 10 min, a solution of 50.0 g (0.26 mol) of diphenylacetonitrile (Note 4) in 200 mL of THF is added over 30 min forming a deep yellow solution. A solution of 28.3 mL (0.29 mol) of 4-bromobutyronitrile (Note 5), (Note 6) in 200 mL of THF is then added over 20 min. The resulting bright-yellow solution is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight (10 hr) (Note 7). The reaction mixture is quenched by the slow addition of water (25 mL) and then is diluted with 400 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE), and washed with water (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The aqueous layers are back-extracted with MTBE (100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the resulting crude dinitrile is placed under high vacuum (0.2 mm) for 1 hr. The dinitrile is transferred to a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, magnetic stirrer, nitrogen/vacuum adapter, and a thermometer and is dissolved in a mixture of tert-butyl alcohol (400 mL) and THF (200 mL). To the solution is added 23.25 g (0.21 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide, and the suspension is heated at 60\u00b0C (internal temperature) for 2 hr. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, it is quenched with water (25 mL), diluted with MTBE (500 mL), and washed with water (100 mL) and brine (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The aqueous layers are back-extracted with MTBE (100 mL), and the combined organic layers are dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford an off-white granular solid. The crude product is suspended in MTBE (75 mL), cooled (0\u00b0C), filtered, and recrystallized from absolute ethanol (400 mL). The mother liquor is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, purified by column chromatography on silica gel (330 g) (Note 8) eluting with hexane/EtOAc (4/1), and recrystallized from absolute ethanol to afford a combined yield of 57.7 g (86%) of the enaminonitrile as a white solid (Note 9),(Note 10).",

To a 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and wide inner-spiral reflux condenser (Note 11) is added 57.5 g (0.22 mol) of the enaminonitrile from step A and 800 mL of concd hydrochloric acid (HCl, (Note 12)). The mixture is stirred for 5 min, and 800 mL of water is added. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux (heating mantle, 110\u00b0C internal temperature) with vigorous stirring for 4 days (Note 13), (Note 14), (Note 15). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 5 \u00d7 200 mL). The organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, 100 mL) and brine (100 mL), and the aqueous layers are back-extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL).

            "C. (R)-(\u2212)-2,2-Diphenylcyclopentanol 1. In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 125-mL graduated, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, 30-mm, egg-shaped magnetic stir bar, nitrogen/vacuum adapter, and an internal temperature probe is placed 1.76 g (6.34 mmol) of the B-methyloxazaborolidine catalyst (Note 1), (Note 19), (Note 20). The apparatus is evacuated, flushed with nitrogen, charged with 86 mL of dry THF and 6.34 mL (63.4 mmol) of borane-methyl sulfide complex, and then warmed to 40\u00b0C (internal temperature) (Note 21). In a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen/vacuum adapter and magnetic stirrer is placed 15 g (63.4 mmol) of 2,2-diphenylcyclopentanone. The flask is evacuated, flushed with nitrogen, and charged with 111 mL of dry THF. After dissolution, the ketone solution is transferred to the addition funnel via cannula and added dropwise over 8 hr to the stirred catalyst solution maintained at 40\u00b0C (Note 22). After complete addition, the funnel is rinsed into the reaction vessel with 10 mL of dry THF, and the resulting reaction mixture is stirred at 40\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. Finally, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C and carefully quenched by the dropwise addition of 100 mL of methanol ( CAUTION: considerable hydrogen evolution occurs after a short induction period) (Note 23). The cold bath is removed and the reaction is stirred until gas evolution ceases (Note 24). The resulting solution is poured into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and the reaction vessel is rinsed with 50 mL of methanol. A simple distillation head is attached to the 1-L flask and 100 mL of solvent is distilled (CAUTION: the distillate contains malodorous methyl sulfide). An additional 100 mL of fresh methanol is added and 100 mL of solvent is again distilled. The residue is cooled to room temperature and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a slightly yellow oil. The oil is dissolved in MTBE (250 mL), washed with aqueous 0.1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the combined acidic, aqueous phases are back-extracted with MTBE (100 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford 15.1 g of an off-white solid. The solid is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 180\u00b0C/0.2 mm) to afford 14.7 g (97%) of (R)-(\u2212)-2,2-diphenylcyclopentanol (92% ee) as an analytically-pure, white solid (Note 25), (Note 26). Multiple recrystallizations of the product from hexane afford 11.3 g (75%) of (R)-(\u2212)-2,2-diphenylcyclopentanol (>97% ee) (Note 26), (Note 27), (Note 28). To recover the catalyst precursor, (S)-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol, the acidic, aqueous phase is made basic (blue to litmus) by addition of 25 mL of aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a clear oil that crystallizes under high vacuum (0.1 mm, several hours). The solid is recrystallized from hexane to afford 1.5 g (93% recovery) of (S)-\u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol as a white crystalline solid (Note 29)."

To the cooled (15\u201320\u00b0C) suspension is added phosgene (324 mL, 0.625 mol, 1.93 M in toluene), via a pressure-equalized addition funnel, over a 0.5\u20131.0 hr period maintaining a temperature of 15\u201320\u00b0C (Note 2). The reaction mixture is then aged for 0.5\u20130.75 hr at 30\u201340\u00b0C. The reaction mixture should become homogeneous as the proline reacts with the phosgene to afford the intermediate N-carbamoyl chloride. Once homogeneous, the reaction mixture is aged an additional 0.5 hr, then concentrated under reduced pressure (15\u201320\u00b0C, 1000 down to 50 mBar) to a volume of 80 mL (Note 3). Dry tetrahydrofuran (600 mL, KF < 50 \u03bcg/mL) is added to the mixture and it is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C. Dry triethylamine (72.6 mL, 0.521 mol, KF < 50 \u03bcg/mL) is added over 0.25 hr (Note 4). The mixture is aged for 0.5 hr at 0\u20135\u00b0C, then filtered through an enclosed, 2-L, medium-frit Schlenk funnel under an atmosphere of nitrogen (with careful exclusion of moisture). The triethylammonium hydrochloride cake is washed with dry tetrahydrofuran (3 \u00d7 105 mL, KF < 50 \u03bcg/mL).

The addition funnel is rinsed with dry xylenes (10 mL). During the addition an exothermic reaction occurs (warming the mixture to ca. 35\u00b0C) resulting in the formation of the bismethylboronic acid adduct as a white precipitate (Note 24). After the addition, the mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr, then heated and concentrated by distillation (1 atm) (Note 25) to a volume of ca. 100 mL (Note 26).

After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at \u221220\u00b0C (Note 39). After the reaction is complete, the mixture is cautiously poured into a 1-L flask containing magnetically-stirred, pre-cooled (\u221220\u00b0C) methanol (300 mL) (Note 40). The cooling bath is removed, and the stirred mixture allowed to warm to room temperature (20\u201325\u00b0C). After evolution of hydrogen ceases, the mixture is concentrated by distillation (1 atm) to a volume of ca. 50 mL. Methanol (200 mL) is added, and the distillation repeated (Note 41). The residue containing the product and diphenylprolinol is diluted with methanol (100 mL) and then loaded onto a 2.5 \u00d7 30-cm column packed with Amberlyst 15 (NH+4) (Note 42) at ca. 2.5 mL/min, collecting 40-mL fractions. The column is rinsed with methanol until the product is eluted (Note 43). The column is then rinsed with 1 M methanolic ammonia until the diphenylprolinol is eluted. The fractions containing the product (2\u201315) are combined, and then concentrated under reduced pressure (40\u00b0C, 100 mm) to give 26.2 g of crude product as a white crystalline solid (Note 44). The crude product is dissolved in hexane (260 mL) at 50\u201360\u00b0C in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer. The product is allowed to crystallize as the stirred mixture is slowly cooled to 20\u201325\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for 4 hr at 20\u201322\u00b0C, filtered, and the cake washed with hexane (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The product is dried in a vacuum oven (30\u00b0C, 10 mm) to constant weight to yield 24.1\u201325.2 g (90\u201394%) of the title compound as a white crystalline solid (Note 45) and (Note 46)."

Efficient magnetic stirring is initiated, and 5.8 mL of \u03b1,\u03b1-dichlorotoluene (7.2 g, 0.045 mol) (Note 3) is added dropwise over ~5 min via a syringe under argon (Note 4). The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for 3 hr during which time the precipitate dissolves (Note 5). After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of water is added to remove inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with portions of ether (2 \u00d7 50-mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is saturated with anhydrous hydrogen bromide (Note 6), whereupon a light yellow precipitate forms that is collected to afford 6.8\u20137.2 g (89\u201393%) of essentially pure triphenylcyclopropenium bromide (Note 7).

An air condenser (20 cm length) loosely packed with glass wool is attached to the reaction vessel. The outlet of the air condenser is connected to a 75 \u00d7 350-mm Dewar condenser filled with dry ice-acetone that is connected to a receiving flask (100 mL) cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The receiving flask is also connected in series to a second dry ice-acetone cold trap, a trap containing a potassium iodide solution, and a drying tube. A gas inlet tube is connected to the reaction flask and a stream of nitrogen gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture (Note 3). The Oxone is added in portions (10\u201315 g) while the acetone-water mixture is simultaneously added dropwise (Note 4). The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously throughout the addition of reagents (ca. 30 min). A yellow solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone collects in the receiving flask. Vigorous stirring is continued for an additional 15 min while a slight vacuum (ca. 30 mm, water aspirator) is applied to the cold trap (Note 5). The yellow dioxirane solution (62\u201376 mL, (Note 6)) is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and stored in the freezer (\u221225\u00b0C) over Na2SO4.

An oven-dried, 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask (or a 1-L, three-necked flask with a Claisen head fitted in a side neck) is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser with a bubbler, and a 200-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a nitrogen inlet. Under a gentle flow of nitrogen the flask is charged with 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1). The addition funnel is charged with a 1.9 M solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride in diethyl ether (83 mL, 0.158 mol) (Note 2). The mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath (Note 3), and isopropylmagnesium chloride is added over a few minutes with stirring. At this temperature, a solution of diethyl (trichloromethyl)phosphonate (38.3 g, 0.150 mol) (Note 4) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 15 min at \u221278\u00b0C producing a clear orange solution. Anhydrous ethanol (12 g, 0.260 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) is added dropwise at \u221278\u00b0C, producing a clear yellow solution. The resulting mixture is stirred for a few minutes, then allowed to warm slowly to \u221240\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is poured into a beaker containing a stirred mixture of 3 M hydrochloric acid (70 mL), and an equal volume of crushed ice and dichloromethane (70 mL). The yellow color initially dissipates, but the solution becomes yellow orange upon warming to room temperature. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 60 mL). The extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the filtration, the solvents are evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The bright yellow, crude liquid (36.3 g) is transferred to a pear-shaped flask fitted with a 10-cm Vigreux column and distilled under reduced pressure to give 26.6 g (80%) of diethyl (dichloromethyl)phosphonate, 1, as a pale yellow liquid, bp 115\u2013119\u00b0C/9 mm, >90% pure by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Note 5) and (Note 6).",

The solution is cooled with stirring to \u221220\u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath and a solution of diisopropylamine (15.1 g, 0.149 mol) (Note 8) in tetrahydrofuran (220 mL) (Note 1), is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting clear solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and treated by the dropwise addition of a solution of 1 (30 g, 0.136 mol) and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (18.1 g, 0.133 mol) (Note 8) in tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) over 30 min. The resulting brown solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for an additional 30 min, then allowed to warm slowly to 0\u00b0C over 60 min. The resulting mixture is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and a solution of butyllithium (1.56 M in hexane, 183 mL, 0.285 mol) (Note 7) is added dropwise over 20 min. The resulting brown solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for an additional 30 min, then allowed to warm slowly to 0\u00b0C over 60 min. At this temperature, the reaction mixture is quenched by the dropwise addition of 3 M hydrochloric acid to pH 5\u20136 (125\u2013130 mL). The brown color has practically disappeared and the solution is yellow orange. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50-mL). The extracts are combined, washed with water (3 \u00d7 10 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and the solvents are evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in hexane (200 mL) and filtered after 30 min. Solvent is again completely evaporated under reduced pressure.

Into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 6.72 g of magnesium bromide diethyl etherate (MgBr2\u00b7Et2O) (26.0 mmol) under nitrogen (Note 1). Anhydrous ether, 350 mL, (Note 2) is added with a syringe, and the mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C for a few minutes to dissolve the solid. Using an air-tight syringe, 11.2 mL of a 3.0 M solution of methylmagnesium bromide in ether (34 mmol, (Note 3)) is added to the slightly turbid solution at 25\u00b0C over a period of a few minutes. N,N-Diisopropylamine, 4.46 mL (34 mmol, (Note 4)) is added over 5 min, and the mixture is stirred for 16\u201318 hr, during which time a fine white precipitate forms (Note 5). The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and a solution of 5.28 g of 2-methyl-1-tetralone (33 mmol, (Note 6)) in 20 mL of anhydrous ether is added with a cannula over a 10-min period. The mixture becomes a bright yellow solution during the addition, and after 45 min of additional stirring, it becomes pale yellow.",
            "B. 2-(1-Hydroxycyclopropyl)-2-methyl-1-tetralone. Simultaneously with the above operations, a separate 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet, and a septum, and the flask is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Anhydrous ether, 600 mL, and 20 mL of a 3.0 M solution of methylmagnesium bromide in ether (60 mmol, (Note 3)) are added to the flask with a cannula and a syringe, respectively, and the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C. A solution of 6.12 g of cyclopropanone ethyl hemiketal2 (60.0 mmol, (Note 7)) in 20 mL of anhydrous ether is added with vigorous stirring over several minutes with a cannula. During this addition, gas evolution is observed, and a fine white precipitate forms. After the mixture is stirred for 15 min, the solution of the enolate of 2-methyl-1-tetralone is added using a wide gauge cannula (ca. 1 mm id) over several minutes. The resulting turbid, light yellow solution is heated at reflux for 4 hr. The resulting clear, yellow solution is cooled to 25\u00b0C and diluted with 200 mL of ether. The organic solution is washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (3 \u00d7 200 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (200 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to give 7.92 g of crude 2-(1-hydroxycyclopropyl)-2-methyl-1-tetralone (Note 8) as a clear yellow oil that is used in the next step without further purification.",
            "C. (3a\u03b2,9b\u03b2)-1,2,3a,4,5,9b-Hexahydro-9b-hydroxy-3a-methyl-3H-benz[e]inden-3-one.3 The yellow oil from Part B is dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous ether in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask at 25\u00b0C under nitrogen. Into a separate 250-mL flask containing a magnetic stirring bar are placed 4.0 g of powdered sodium hydride (166 mmol, (Note 9)), and 100 mL of anhydrous ether at 25\u00b0C under nitrogen. The solution of the yellow oil is added with stirring over a period of a few minutes using a cannula. The mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C for 3 hr, during which time it becomes yellow-orange. The reaction is quenched by adding 100 mL of ice-cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 100 mL of ether. The organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (3 \u00d7 100 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The crude product is obtained as 5.8 g of yellow-orange crystals. The solid is dissolved in about 150 mL of warm ether, and 100 mL of hexanes is added. The mixture is concentrated to ca. 100 mL in a heating bath (or on a steam bath), and the resulting cloudy solution is cooled slowly to 0\u00b0C. An initial crop of 4.73 g (67%) of pale yellow crystals is obtained and the mother liquor is decanted from the solid and concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to ca. 5 mL to give 0.39 g (5%) of pale yellow crystals as a second crop. The mother liquor may then be concentrated and the residue purified by flash chromatography4 on silica gel using 1:1 ether/hexane to give 0.29 g (4%) of additional product (Rf = 0.33) as yellow crystals after washing with warm 1:1 ether/hexane. The total combined yield of (3a\u03b2,9b\u03b2)-1,2,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-9b-hydroxy-3a-methyl-3H-benz[e]inden-3-one is 5.41 g (76%) (Note 10)."

An oven-dried, three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a Claisen adapter bearing a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet and rubber septum, and a thermometer. The flask is maintained under a static nitrogen pressure and charged with 5-methyl-5-hexen-2-one (24.20 g, 0.216 mol) (Note 2), trimethyl borate (60 mL) (Note 3), tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) (THF) (Note 4), and freshly activated 20-mesh zinc granules (16.96 g, 0.259 g-atom) (Note 5). The reaction flask is immersed in an oil bath at 25\u00b0C. Stirring is initiated and methyl bromoacetate (39.65 g, 0.259 mol) (Note 6) is added in a single portion through the septum. After an induction time (Note 7), a white precipitate starts to form and an increase of the internal temperature, up to reflux, is observed (Note 8). The mixture is stirred for 3 hr, after which time starting material is completely consumed (Note 9). The reaction is quenched by the sequential addition of glycerol (60 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (60 mL), then is transferred to a separatory funnel using 120 mL of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted again with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with aqueous 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (3 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to afford 37.32\u201338.92 g of crude \u03b2-hydroxy ester (93\u201397% yield) (Note 10).",

In a 500-mL flask, the crude ester prepared in Part A (37.00 g, 0.199 mol) is dissolved in a 2 N solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol (130 mL, 0.260 mol). The solution is stirred at 25\u00b0C and disappearance of the starting material is monitored by GLC (Note 9). After 5 hr saponification is complete and the methanol is evaporated at reduced pressure (Note 11). The residue is taken up with water (500 mL), extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the organic phase is discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified (pH 2.5 on universal pH indicator paper) with ~6 N hydrochloric acid (about 60 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 100 mL). These latter ethereal extracts are washed with water (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Evaporation at reduced pressure affords crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid as a viscous yellow oil that can be used in Part C without further purification. Evacuation at 0.5 mm at room temperature with internal magnetic stirring for 24 hr gives 28.07\u201329.40 g (82\u201386% yield) of a solvent-free material (Note 12) and (Note 13).",

The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is charged with 6.66 mL (75 mmol) of 2-bromopropene (Note 2) dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) (Note 3). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C by a dry ice/acetone bath, at which point 88 mL of 1.7 M tert-butyllithium in pentane (150 mmol) is introduced dropwise in three roughly equal portions from a 50-mL syringe (Note 4) during 45 min. The colorless reaction mixture is allowed to stir at \u221278\u00b0C for approximately 30 min (Note 5).\nA 250 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a rubber septum and gas inlet, is flame-dried under vacuum, filled with argon, and charged with a solution of diisopropyl squarate (5.94 g, 30 mmol) (Note 6) in dry tetrahydrofuran (150 mL). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and cannulated rapidly into the reaction flask (Note 7). After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 0\u00b0C, then for an additional 15 hr at room temperature. Following recooling to 0\u00b0C, 180 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 8) is added via syringe, the ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for an additional 7 hr.\nThe reaction mixture is poured into a 2000-mL separatory funnel containing water (300 mL) and ether (300 mL). After thorough mixing, the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 200 mL).

The equipment consists of a 250-mL constant pressure addition funnel, a thermometer, and an air-cooled Friedrichs condenser attached to a gas inlet-outlet adapter. A 250-mL vacuum flask is equipped with a gas delivery tube that is inserted through a single-holed rubber stopper and positioned 1 cm above the bottom of an aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide solution. This assembly is used as a gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) trap (Note 2). The flask is charged with mesitylene (Note 3) (76.0 g, 0.630 mol) and its contents cooled to between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C in a wet ice\u2013acetone bath while stirring (Note 4). When the contents of the flask and HCl trap are between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, a 6-mL portion of the total quantity of the chlorosulfonic acid (Note 3) (161.0 g, 92.1 mL, 1.39 mol) is added to initiate the reaction. After HCl gas evolution begins, the remaining chlorosulfonic acid is added at a rate such that the reaction temperature remains below 60\u00b0C (Note 5). After the chlorosulfonic acid is added, the reaction mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C to disperse and dissolve any precipitated salts (Note 6) and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture is poured into 250 mL of ice water with stirring, and the crude crystals are recovered by suction filtration. The crystals are washed with generous portions of ice-cold water. The crude product is taken up in 125 mL of dichloromethane and a 50-mL upper aqueous layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with one 50-mL portion of methylene chloride. The combined organic fractions are dried over sodium sulfate (Note 7) with vigorous stirring, filtered and then concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Crude mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (109.7 g, 80%) is recovered as an oil that solidifies into off-white crystals, mp 54\u201356\u00b0C (Note 8). If used immediately, no additional purification is necessary (Note 9).\nFigure 1\nUsing the equipment in Figure 1, but without the HCl gas trap attached, mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (109.7 g, 0.503 mmol, (Note 7)) is dissolved in 175 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and cooled to between \u221210\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C in a wet ice\u2013acetone bath. Hydrazine monohydrate (63.0 g, 61.0 mL, 1.26 mol) (Note 3) is dissolved in 30 mL of ice-cold water and added so that the temperature remains below 25\u00b0C (Note 10). After the addition is completed, the mixture is stirred for an additional 45 min at room temperature and poured into 250 mL of ice water with stirring. Crude mesitylenesulfonylhydrazine is recovered by suction filtration and then dissolved in 500 mL of dichloromethane. A 150- to 175-mL portion of water separates. The water layer is removed, and the organic layer is washed with one 50-mL portion of ice-cold water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The crystals are triturated in 250 mL of cold hexane, and the fluffy white product (95.4 g, 89%, (Note 11)) is recovered by suction filtration ((Note 12) and (Note 13)).",

The flask is placed in an oil bath and fitted with a 30-cm reflux condenser. On top of the condenser is placed a three-way stopcock having horizontal and vertical tubulations. A source of nitrogen (N2) is connected to the system via the horizontal tubulation of the stopcock, and a septum is placed over the vertical tubulation. The entire system is flushed several times with N2, and the solution is heated to reflux (68\u00b0C) during which time it becomes deep purple.\nInto a dry, 50-mL, conical vial is placed dimethyl diazomalonate (29.4 mmol, 4.65 g) and 25 mL of chloroform (Note 9). The solution is taken up into a syringe (Note 10) fitted with a 30-cm needle. The needle is inserted about half way into the septum on the stopcock so that the needle tip extends down into the condenser. The syringe is placed on a syringe pump (Note 11) which is set to add the solution at a rate of 1.17 mL/hr over a period of about 25 hr. After the addition is complete, the syringe is again filled with 2 mL of CHCl3, which is added to the system via the septum. The needle is removed, and the stopcock plug is rotated so that the septum is closed off from the system while the N2 inlet remains open. The solution is allowed to continue stirring at reflux for another 20 hr. It is then concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to yield a brownish-purple oil containing crude product.

At 0\u20135\u00b0C, under nitrogen, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (980 \u03bcL, 11.1 mmol) (Note 1) is added in one portion. To the resulting yellow solution, bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) azodicarboxylate (BTCEAD) (50.70 g, 133.3 mmol) (Note 2) is gradually introduced over 15 min in order to maintain an internal temperature between 0\u20135\u00b0C.\nThe orange-yellow solution is stirred for 5.5 hr at room temperature until complete reaction has taken place. The reaction mixture is poured into saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution (100 mL) at 0\u00b0C. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is reextracted with CH2Cl2 (30 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (H2O) (2 \u00d7 50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated and placed on a vacuum pump to afford a pale yellow foam. Ethyl acetate (85 mL) is added and the crude mixture is heated under reflux until complete dissolution occurs. At reflux hexane (85 mL) is added and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. After a period of 15 hr the flask containing a mass of solid is cooled in an ice bath for 1.5 hr. The solid is collected by filtration and washed with a cold ethyl acetate-hexane mixture (1:4) (50 mL). The hydrazide is dried under high vacuum at 45\u00b0C for 3 days (Note 3) to provide 52.0 g (84%) of a white solid sufficiently pure for the next step (Note 4). From the mother liquor, an additional 3.8 g (6.0%) of material is recovered by flash chromatography (20% ethyl acetate in hexane) followed by recrystallization from ethyl acetate-hexane (1:1 mixture, 20 mL).",

A 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer is charged with the hydrazide (54.0 g, 96.3 mmol) and acetic acid (480 mL). To the suspension at 16\u00b0C is added zinc dust (35.6 g, 544 mmol) (Note 5) portionwise over 5 min. After a period of 10 min, the cooling bath is removed to allow the internal temperature to reach 35\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for about 3 hr until no hydrazide is detected by TLC (30% ethyl acetate in hexane, Rf = 0.3). The mixture is filtered over Celite and washed carefully with CH2Cl2 (15 \u00d7 40 mL). After removal of the solvents under reduced pressure, the brown mixture is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (800 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (600 mL). Additional solid NaHCO3 is then added until pH 8 is attained. The resulting milky mixture is filtered over Celite, washed carefully with CH2Cl2 (10 \u00d7 100 mL), and the organic phase separated. The water phase is reextracted with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the resulting green residue is dissolved in hot CH2Cl2 (80 mL) and purified by flash chromatography (200 g of silica gel) (5% CH2Cl2/30% ethyl acetate/hexane). The indazole (14.02 g) is obtained as a yellowish solid. Crude product is recrystallized twice from ethyl acetate (100 mL) to provide 9.6 g of pure indazole (52%) as white crystals (Note 6).

The suspension is stirred until the binaphthol is completely dissolved. Powdered 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves (16.0 g) (Note 4) are then added. To the resultant suspension is added a 1 M methylene chloride solution of titanium tetraisopropoxide (4.0 mL, 4.0 mmol) (Note 5) by syringe at ambient temperature. The resulting orange-red suspension is heated at reflux for 1 hr (Note 6). The red-brown mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and a methylene chloride (6 mL) solution of benzyloxyacetaldehyde (Note 7) (6.0 g, 40 mmol) is injected via syringe. The resulting mixture is stirred for 5 min at ambient temperature, then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. To the reaction mixture is added allyltributylstannane (Note 8) (15.9 g, 14.9 mL, 48 mmol) via syringe. The resulting reaction mixture is then kept in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0C for 60 hr without stirring. Even after 60 hr a small amount of unreacted aldehyde is detected (TLC analysis) (Note 9). The reaction mixture is quenched with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (50 mL), diluted with methylene chloride (50 mL), and stirred at ambient temperature for 2 hr. The molecular sieves are removed by filtration through a pad of Celite, and the aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (2 \u00d7 25 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.

Hydrobromic acid (48%,123 mL, 1.09 mol) is added at room temperature and the mixture is cooled to \u221213\u00b0C with stirring (Note 3). Nitrogen, N2, is bubbled through the solution and sodium nitrite (42.8 g, 0.62 mol) is slowly added in small portions (ca. 5 g every 15 min) (Note 4). After each addition, the reaction mixture turns brown and then the color slowly fades, but the solution does not decolorize entirely. The total time required for addition of all the sodium nitrite is approximately 2.5 hr. The solution is then allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C, the N2 purge is stopped, and the mixture is stirred for 6 hr. Excess nitrogen oxides are removed by bubbling N2 through the solution for 1 hr. The pale green solution is then extracted with ether (6 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic extracts are concentrated to 0.5 L by rotary evaporation and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After filtration, the ether is evaporated and the residual solvent is removed under reduced pressure (0.1 mm). The pale yellow or green oil (74-75 g, 87-89%) is used immediately in the next reaction without purification (Note 5), (Note 6), (Note 7).\nPotassium (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Potassium glycidate). The crude acid from the preceding step (74.5 g, 0.44 mol) is dissolved in absolute ethanol (300 mL) and cooled to \u221220\u00b0C. Under N2, a filtered solution of potassium hydroxide (86%, 55.5 g, 0.85 mol) in absolute ethanol (300 mL) is slowly added. After 2 hr, the mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C and stirred at this temperature for 14 hr. The solution is filtered to remove precipitated salts. Half of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation without warming and an additional crop of salt (2-4 g) is isolated by filtration. The combined salts are dried under vacuum to give 105 g of a 1 : 1 mixture of KBr and potassium glycidate .\nOne third of this mixture (35 g) is extracted by refluxing in a mixture of 585 mL of absolute ethanol and 15 mL of water in a 1-L flask with good stirring for 45 min (Note 8). After filtration of the hot suspension, the glycidate crystallizes from the filtered solution to give 12-13 g of product. Another third of the 1 : 1 KBr-potassium glycidate mixture is heated at reflux with stirring in the mother liquors for 45 min. After the second batch of crystalline potassium glycidate is isolated by filtration, the procedure is repeated with the last portion of the KBr-glycidate mixture. The solids collected from the three hot filtrations are combined and extracted a fourth time with the same solution, then crystallized to give additional product. After drying, the total weight of recrystallized potassium glycidate is 47-50 g. This salt contains 9.5-13% of KBr , and the yield is thus 74-80% (corrected for KBr content) (Note 9), (Note 10).\nEthyl (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Ethyl glycidate).

The solvent and excess ethyl bromide are then slowly removed by rotary evaporation without warming, and the resulting viscous solid is triturated with anhydrous diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL) to extract the ethyl glycidate . The combined ethereal extracts are filtered and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is slowly removed by rotary evaporation (without warming) and the residue is distilled at 40\u00b0C (2.4 mm) with 0\u00b0C water circulated through the condenser to afford 17.6 g of ethyl glycidate (81%) (Note 12), (Note 13)."

The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min, allowing the solids to dissolve. The resulting solution is treated with 0.182 g (0.811 mmol, 0.003 equiv) of palladium acetate , 0.638 g (2.43 mmol, 0.009 equiv) of triphenylphosphine , 162 mL of 2 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (0.324 mol, 1.20 equiv), 95.0 mL of deionized water and heated to reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 1).\nAfter 45 min at reflux, a reaction aliquot checked by 1H NMR indicates that the reaction is complete (Note 2), (Note 3) and (Note 4). The heat source is removed and 350 mL of water is added while the mixture is still hot. The nitrogen gas source is removed and the reaction is allowed to stir open to the atmosphere for 2.5 hr while cooling to room temperature (Note 5). The darkened mixture is diluted with 500 mL of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel (Note 6). The two phases are separated and the aqueous layer is back-extracted with two additional 250-mL portions of ethyl acetate . The combined organic layers are washed with 250 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) followed by saturated brine, 2 \u00d7 250 mL (Note 7). The organic solution is placed in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask with a magnetic stirring bar, treated with 25.0 g of Darco G-60 (Note 8) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. To the mixture is added 50.0 g of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) (Note 9) and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min.\nA 2-L filter flask is equipped with an 11-cm B\u00fcchner funnel with filter paper. The funnel is charged with Celite to a depth of 1 cm (Note 10) and 50.0 g of Florisil is spread evenly on top of the Celite. The above mixture is filtered through this pad of filter aid (Note 11). The filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate, 2 \u00d7 100 mL . The resulting pale yellow filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 47.3 g (96.2%) of pale yellow crystals (Note 12).\nThe crude solids are treated with 189 mL of hexanes (4 mL/g) and slurried at room temperature for 10 min before heating to reflux (Note 13). The resulting hazy solution is treated with 47.3 mL of methanol (1 mL/g), which clarifies the mixture (Note 14). Crystallization is induced by removing the heat source and allowing the mixture to cool slowly to room temperature over 2 hr. The flask is placed in a freezer to chill overnight. The thick slurry of crystals is filtered, rinsed with cold hexanes, 2 \u00d7 40 mL , and vacuum dried at room temperature to afford 42.5 g of pale yellow crystals (86.3% overall yield) (Note 15) and (Note 16)."

Potassium carbonate, 25.0 g (0.180 mol), is dissolved in 200 mL of water (Note 4) in a separate 250-mL Schlenk flask. In a third flask (25-mL Schlenk flask) 3.30 mg (0.02 mmol, 0.2%) of palladium acetate (Note 5) is dissolved in 10 mL of acetone . All three flasks are then thoroughly degassed by four freeze-pump-thaw cycles.

The top layer turns brown upon addition of the catalyst. The septum is replaced with the glass stopper and three additional freeze-pump-thaw cycles are applied. The flask is then backfilled with argon, and the reaction is brought to reflux under a positive argon pressure. After 2 hr at reflux the heat source is removed and the reaction is allowed to cool.

            "A. Pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propan-1-ol . A dry, 5-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer adapter, and a condenser is charged with 417 g (3.06 mol) of pentaerythritol (Note 1) and 730 g (9.24 mol) of pyridine (Note 2). A Drierite drying tube is attached to the condenser, and the addition funnel is closed with a glass stopper after being charged with 1.134 kg (9.53 mol) of thionyl chloride (Note 3). The reaction flask is placed inside a bucket to which an ice/water mixture may be added in the event that the reaction becomes too exothermic. Thionyl chloride is added dropwise with vigorous stirring to the slurry so that the white mist that appears in the flask does not rise up into the condenser. Thionyl chloride is added as rapidly as possible over 4-5 hr so that the temperature of the yellow-orange reaction mixture is maintained between 65-95\u00b0C (Note 4). When the addition is complete, the drying tube is removed, and the ice bucket is replaced with a heating mantle. The resulting orange-yellow reaction mixture is heated to 120-130\u00b0C until no more sulfur dioxide is evolved (Note 5). As the heating continues, the reaction mixture turns from dark orange to brown, and gas evolution becomes evident. After gas evolution ceases, the flask is cooled slightly and 2 L of cold water is added with stirring. The brown-yellow product precipitates, is filtered, and washed with 2-3 L of water. The dried, crude product (461 g) is approximately a 1:2.8 mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride (131 g) and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin (330 g, 57% yield) (Note 6). This crude material may be used directly in the next step (Note 7).",
            "B. Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propanoic acid . (Caution: Nitrogen oxides are highly toxic. This procedure should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood!) The crude mixture (461 g) of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin obtained from the above reaction is transferred to a 3-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask that is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, and an addition funnel. The transfer is most easily accomplished by melting the solid over a steam bath and pouring the mixture through a funnel directly into the reaction flask. The flask and its contents are heated to 70-80\u00b0C with a heating mantle (Note 8), and a small portion (10-15 mL) of concentrated nitric acid (Note 9) is added with vigorous stirring to initiate the reaction (Note 10). As the reaction begins, a large amount of dark orange-brown vapors appears. Stirring is continued, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed after the initial exothermic reaction subsides (usually within 15 min). The remaining nitric acid (660-680 mL) is added in 20-30-mL aliquots over 30 to 60 min so that nitrogen oxides are continually evolved but the reaction does not become violent. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is carefully removed and left in the hood to air out and is replaced by a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is heated at 70-80\u00b0C until the evolution of nitrogen oxides is no longer evident (Note 11). At this point, the biphasic reaction mixture is a cloudy yellow or white liquid. The warm reaction mixture is poured into a 4-L beaker and 2 L of cold water is added is to precipitate the tetrachloride/carboxylic acid product mixture. The beaker and its contents are allowed to stand for several hours at room temperature to ensure complete precipitation of the product; then the crude product mixture is filtered, washed with water, and the carboxylic acid is extracted as follows. The solid is pulverized, transferred to a 4-L beaker, and 2.5 L of 1 M sodium hydroxide is added with stirring (Note 12). The liquid reaction mixture instantly becomes bright yellow, and the insoluble, white tetrachloride clumps on the sides of the beaker. Stirring is continued for 30-60 min whereupon the insoluble material is filtered and washed well with water. The combined washings and yellow, aqueous filtrate are acidified to pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (~250 mL). The carboxylic acid precipitates as a white solid that is easily filtered using two pieces of filter paper. The filtered and dried product thus obtained is a fine white powder (230 g, 65% yield). The aqueous filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride ; the extracts are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated to provide an additional 50-60 g of the desired acid. The crude, combined product (75% yield) can be used directly in the next step (Note 13). Over several runs, the yield varies from 65-80%.",
            "C. 3-Chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-1-propene . Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid (205 g, 1.00 mol) is transferred to a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask. On top of the powdery acid, which nearly fills the flask, is placed a football magnetic stir bar (1.25 \u00d7 0.5 in.). The neck of the flask to be clamped is wrapped well with aluminum foil and is fitted with a glass stopper. A standard taper 24/40 short path still head, to which is attached a Drierite drying tube, is attached at the second neck. The upper flask and short path column are wrapped with aluminum foil, and the flask is immersed in a high temperature oil bath (Note 14) that has been preheated to a stable 210\u00b0C. As the solid melts, the reaction mixture becomes yellow, and the oil bath temperature drops (10-20\u00b0C). If after 10-15 min, the temperature does not rise to between 205-215\u00b0C, it may be necessary to adjust the heating to maintain the oil bath temperature between 205-215\u00b0C (Note 15). Moderate stirring is maintained throughout the reaction (Note 16). Within 30 to 60 min, gas evolution becomes apparent, the reaction mixture turns brown, then black, and the product begins to distill. As the reaction proceeds, a black, tarry residue begins to build up on the bottom and sides of the flask. The product begins to distill, slowly at first, then quite steadily, at which point the head temperature rises to 138\u00b0C (Note 17). The reaction time varies (Note 17), but heating is continued until just before dryness. The product (115 g, 92% yield) thus obtained is a clear, colorless liquid (bp 136-138\u00b0C) that is > 98% pure by GLC and 1H NMR analysis (Note 18). Over several runs, the yield varies from 88-99%."

Into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a condenser equipped with a potassium hydroxide drying tube, are placed 54.1 g (0.403 mol) of 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)propene (Note 1), 212 g (0.805 mol) of bromoform (Note 2), 1.70-2.00 g (14.4-16.9 mmol) of pinacol (Note 3), and 1.45 g (3.94 mmol) of dibenzo-18-crown-6 (Note 4). With very vigorous stirring (Note 5), 312 g of an aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide solution that has been cooled to 15\u00b0C is added in one portion. The reaction mixture turns orange, then brown, then black within 5 min, and the temperature of the reaction mixture begins to rise. Within 20 min, the internal reaction temperature is 49-50\u00b0C at which point the reaction flask is cooled with a room-temperature water bath, and the reaction temperature decreases to ca. 20\u00b0C. After 1 hr, the bath is removed and the reaction mixture is heated to 40\u00b0C (internal temperature) with an oil bath. The vigorously stirred mixture is maintained at this temperature for 4 days (Note 6). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, diluted with 500 mL of water, and filtered through a pad of Celite on a glass-fritted funnel (pore size C), using a water aspirator (Note 7). Up to an additional 1-L of water is used to rinse the thick black reaction mixture from the flask. The resulting golden-yellow filtrate is discarded (Note 8). The black, solid residue in the frit, and any material remaining in the reaction flask are transferred to a 1-L beaker with pentane, acetone, and a glass rod, and the solution is vigorously stirred with an additional 500 mL of a 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetone and pentane for 30 min. This mixture is filtered through a glass-fritted funnel using a minimal layer of Celite. The Celite pad is washed thoroughly with 1:1 pentane/acetone solution, and the resulting brown filtrate is dried over magnesium sulfate . Concentration using a rotary evaporator, followed by distillation under reduced pressure (bp 75-85\u00b0C/0.4 mm), and low temperature (ca. \u221220\u00b0C) recrystallization from pentane (ca. 1 mL/g of product), provide 70-95 g (60-80% yield) of the product as small, white crystals (mp 47.5-50\u00b0C) (Note 9) and (Note 10).",
            "B. [1.1.1]Propellane (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that has been flame dried under reduced pressure and purged with argon, is equipped with a vacuum adapter equipped with an argon balloon, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a pressure-equalizing, 150-mL addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with a 25-g (0.085 mol) portion of material obtained from part A, and 25 mL of pentane (Note 11). A diethyl ether solution of methyllithium, 132 mL of a 1.4 M (0.185 mol) solution (Note 12), is transferred to the addition funnel via cannula under a flow of argon. The reaction flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and the methyllithium is added over 15 min with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is maintained at \u221278\u00b0C for 10 - 15 min; then the \u221278\u00b0C cooling bath is replaced with an ice-water bath (0\u00b0C), and the addition funnel is replaced with a rubber septum equipped with an argon balloon. Stirring is continued for an additional hour; then the volatile materials are transferred under reduced pressure to a flame-dried flask that is cooled to \u2212196\u00b0C (Note 13). Based on the recovery of the thiophenol adduct, the yield of [1.1.1]propellane is between 75 and 88%.\nDetermination of the yield of propellane. Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated (Note 14). Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.\nWiberg and Waddell also noted that propellane reacts with iodine in 88% yield.2 Alber and Szeimies report a somewhat lower yield (61%) when an ethereal solution of propellane is treated with a solution of iodine in ether/pentane while being irradiated.3 Thus, titration of a portion of the resulting propellane solution with iodine provides an estimate of the minimum yield. A 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred as noted above. Small pieces of iodine are added with stirring under room light over 10 min until just before the dark color persists. Concentration of the solution provides 1,3-diiodobicyclo[1.1.1]pentane from which the minimal concentration of the propellane solution and minimal yield of propellane may be estimated if iodine is not added in excess. Alternatively, a solution of iodine in diethyl ether/pentane may be added instead of neat iodine."

The mixture is cooled to \u221220\u00b0C in a bath filled with acetone and dry ice. At this temperature a 1.56 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (105.8 mL, 0.165 mol) is added dropwise over 5 min (Note 4). The mixture is allowed to warm up to room temperature within 15 min and is then cooled to \u221290\u00b0C in a bath charged with ethanol and liquid nitrogen (Note 5). A precooled solution of phenyl 2-methylpropanoate (27.09 g, 0.165 mol) in THF (50 mL) is added dropwise within 90 min from the dropping funnel (Note 6) and (Note 7), which is rinsed with THF (3 mL) (Note 8). During the addition the temperature in the reaction flask is maintained at \u221285\u00b0C to \u221290\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 20 min. Thereafter a precooled solution of cyclohexanone (14.72 g, 0.150 mol) (Note 9) in THF (50 mL) is added over a period of 60 min. After stirring for another 30 min at \u221290\u00b0C the mixture is allowed to warm up to ambient temperature. After standing overnight the reaction mixture is poured into a mixture of aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide (200 mL) and diethyl ether (200 mL) and stirred for 10 min. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with 0.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and an aqueous saturated solution of sodium chloride (3 \u00d7 100 mL). Drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate , filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator afford the crude \u03b2-lactone. After recrystallization from diethyl ether/hexane (Note 10) 3,3-dimethyl-1-oxaspiro[3.5]nonan-2-one is obtained in a yield of 91%. Other \u03b2-lactones have also been prepared by the submitters; these were not checked (Note 11), (Note 12)."

To the top of the condenser, a 3-L bag (Note 1), water aspirator through a calcium chloride tube, and allene gas cylinder (Note 2) are connected with two three-way stopcocks as shown in Figure 1. The flask and the bag are evacuated twice using a water aspirator, and filled with allene gas each time (Note 3).

To this solution is added a solution of sodium bisulfite, NaHSO3, (36.1 g, 347 mmol) in 70 mL of water (Note 5),(Note 6),(Note 7). The flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter bearing an immersion thermometer and reflux condenser, and the resulting suspension is heated in an oil bath at 50\u00b0C under argon for 48 hr (Note 8). The suspension is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Note 9) and (Note 10) followed by azeotropic removal of the residual water with methanol (2 \u00d7 25 mL). Methanol (200 mL) is added to the resulting white solid, and the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously for 10 min.

The apparatus is purged with argon. The sodium sulfonate is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath and the addition funnel is charged with 80 mL (1.10 mol) of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) (Note 14). The slow, dropwise addition of SOCl2 to 1 is accompanied by generation of sulfur dioxide, SO2 (Note 15). After addition of the SOCl2 is complete, the addition funnel is removed, and the flask is fitted with a rubber septum and bubbler. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (0.40 mL, 0.38 g, 5.2 mmol) (Note 16) is slowly added via syringe resulting in a substantial increase in the evolution of SO2 (Note 17). The solution is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0\u00b0C during which time evolution of SO2 ceases. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight, resulting in a white precipitate (Note 18). The reaction flask is fitted with a short path distillation head and excess SOCl2 is distilled off at reduced pressure (Note 19). Twice the resulting white paste is diluted with 50 mL of hexanes and the residual SOCl2 and hexanes are removed under reduced pressure. The resulting pale tan slurry is once again diluted with 50 mL of hexanes and the slurry is filtered through a pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with an additional 50 mL of hexanes and the combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to afford 23.5 g of a light brown oil (Note 20). Short path distillation of the crude oil using an oil bath as heat source (70-75\u00b0C at 0.2 mm) affords 19.3 - 22.0 g (~68-77% yield, or 53-66% overall yield from vinyltrimethylsilane) of the sulfonyl chloride 2 (Note 21) and (Note 22) as a pale tan oil."

In an argon atmosphere, the solution is cooled to \u221223\u00b0C (dry ice, CCl4) and 131 mL (2.1 equiv) of 1.6 M butyllithium in hexanes (Note 5) is added dropwise over 1 hr. After addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (1-2 hr) and is stirred at this temperature for 3 hr. The reaction is quenched by dropwise addition of 10 mL of methanol .\nThe flask contents are transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with 100 mL of water, 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solvent is removed by rotary evaporator and the solid residue is triturated with three portions of cold (0-5\u00b0C) methanol (50 mL, then 20 mL twice). The insoluble product is filtered, air dried, and recrystallized from acetone to give as the first crop 3.0-3.4 g of the pure anti isomer (Note 6), (Note 7) mp (dec) > 250\u00b0C (Note 8). Additional crystallizations bring the yield to 4.6 g (22%).\nThe methanol extracts and mother liquor from the final recrystallization of the anti isomer are combined and evaporated to dryness (rotavap). The residue is dissolved in 50 mL of boiling ethyl acetate in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, to which is then added 150 mL of boiling hexanes. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and to stand at that temperature for 2-3 hr. Filtration yields the first crop of syn isomer (approximately 3.6 g). Second and third crops of product are obtained by evaporating the mother liquor to dryness and crystallizing the residue from the same solvent mixture (1:3 ethyl acetate/hexanes) (Note 9), to give a total of 5.3 g (25%) of syn isomer, mp 192-194\u00b0C (Note 10), (Note 11)."
