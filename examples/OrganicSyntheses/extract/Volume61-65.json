        "Procedure": [
            "A 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a 1.2- \u00d7 24-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column that is connected to a condenser, vacuum-take-off adapter, and fraction collector with three receiving flasks (Note 1). The vacuum-take-off adapter is attached to a calcium chloride drying tube which is connected to a water aspirator, and the flask is charged with 35.2 g (28.6 mL, 0.40 mol) of pyruvic acid (Note 2). The pyruvic acid is stirred at room temperature as 46.4 g (36.1 mL, 0.40 mol) of \u03b1,\u03b1-dichloromethyl methyl ether (Note 3) is added slowly over 30 min. Evolution of hydrogen chloride begins after a few minutes. When the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a glass stopper. The solution is stirred and heated at 50\u00b0C in an oil bath for 30 min (Note 4) while a few drops of methyl formate are collected as the first fraction (Note 5). The condenser is then cooled to \u221230\u00b0C (Note 6) and the receiving flasks are cooled to \u221250\u00b0C with chilled acetone. The aspirator is turned on and the pressure is adjusted to 190 mm. With the oil bath at 50\u00b0C, a second fraction, bp 25\u201335\u00b0C (190 mm), is collected. As soon as the head temperature begins to drop, the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the temperature of the oil bath is raised slowly to 75\u00b0C. A third fraction, bp 35\u201340\u00b0C (120 mm), consisting mainly of pyruvoyl chloride is collected (Note 7) and (Note 8). The second and third fractions are combined to give 33\u201341 g of a mixture of pyruvoyl chloride and methyl formate, which is redistilled through a 1.4- by 18-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column (Note 1). The condenser and the receiving flasks are cooled to \u22125\u00b0C with chilled acetone. The first fraction, weighing 2.3\u201311.4 g and consisting mainly of methyl formate, is collected at 25\u201330\u00b0C (190 mm) with an oil bath temperature of 60\u00b0C. When the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the oil bath is maintained at 60\u00b0C, 18.6\u201321.2 g (44\u201350%) of pyruvoyl chloride, bp 43\u201345\u00b0C (120 mm), distills into the receiver as a light yellow liquid, nD20 1.4165 (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

The solution is cooled to approximately \u221270\u00b0C (in an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath) and a 1.6 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is added from a dropping funnel while the temperature is allowed to rise to approximately \u221210\u00b0C. Sufficient butyllithium is added (approx. 190 mL) until a pink color persists for several minutes (Note 3). The heterogeneous solution is recooled to \u221265\u00b0C and 7.90 mL (7.98 g, 75 mmol) of isobutyryl chloride (Note 4) is added dropwise over 5 min.

In a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and 250-mL and 125-mL dropping funnels (Note 1) is placed a solution of 13.34 g (0.23 mol) of 64% hydrazine hydrate (Note 2) in 60 mL of 95% ethanol. The reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath and 96 g (0.46 mol) of 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate (Note 3) is added dropwise so that the temperature is kept below 20\u00b0C. During the addition of 1 equiv of the chloroformate, a white precipitate is formed. After exactly one-half of the chloroformate has been added, a solution of 25 g (0.24 mol) of sodium carbonate in 100 mL of water is added dropwise along with the remaining chloroformate. The rate of addition of these two reagents is such that the flow of the chloroformate is faster than that of the sodium carbonate so that there is always an excess of chloroformate present; the temperature is kept below 20\u00b0C during the addition. As the second equivalent of chloroformate is added the white precipitate dissolves.\nAfter the addition of the reactants is complete, the reaction is allowed to stir for an additional 30 min while the solution warms to room temperature. The reaction mixture is then transferred to a separatory funnel. The viscous organic bottom layer is separated from the aqueous layer and is dissolved in 200 mL of ether. The reaction vessel is washed with 100 mL of ether, and this ether portion is used to extract further the aqueous layer. The ether layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The viscous oil is allowed to crystallize in an ice bath (0\u00b0C). The crystals are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 500 mL of water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator at 0.5 mm for 48 hr. 80.8 g (93%) of white crystalline bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) hydrazodicarboxylate (mp 85\u201389\u00b0C) is obtained. This material is sufficiently pure for the next preparation. However, further purification can be achieved using an Abderhalden drying apparatus (refluxing 95% EtOH for 12 hr at 0.05 mm; MgSO4 desiccant). Material purified in this way melted at 96.5\u201397.5\u00b0C (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nB. Bis (2,2,2-trichloroethyl) azodicarboxylate. Caution! Large amounts of nitrogen oxides are evolved during the oxidation with fuming nitric acid. Therefore, operations should be conducted in an efficient fume hood.\nIn a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and gas outlet tube is added 78.55 g (0.21 mol) of bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) hydrazodicarboxylate dissolved in 180 mL of chloroform (Note 6). The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and 53.2 mL (1.26 mol) of fuming nitric acid (Note 7) and (Note 8) is added so that the temperature of the solution does not rise above 5\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over 4 hr (Note 9). After an additional 2 hr at room temperature, the material is transferred to and shaken in a 1-L separatory funnel half-filled with ice chips. The two layers are allowed to separate and the bottom organic layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with 250 mL of chloroform. The organic layers are combined and washed with 300 mL of water, 300 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate, and again with 300 mL of water. The organic layer is dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The yellow crystals that form are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with more pentane. The pentane filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford more crystalline material which is again collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with more pentane. The cycle is repeated until no more crystals appear after removal of pentane. The yellow crystals so obtained are air dried for 1 hr to afford 59.2 g (75.8%) of bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) azodicarboxylate which melts at 108\u2013110\u00b0C. Further drying using an Abderhalden drying apparatus (refluxing 95% EtOH for 12 hr at 0.5 mm; MgSO4 desiccant) affords a compound that melts at 109\u2013110.5\u00b0C (Note 10),(Note 11),(Note 12)."

            "Benzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA 1-L, four-necked flask is fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer. Acetic acid (558 g) is introduced and 107.6 g (0.439 mol) of manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Note 1) is added with stirring and heating under nitrogen. When the temperature reaches 90\u00b0C, 16.5 g of solid potassium permanganate (0.104 mol) is added. After the temperature has again fallen to 90\u00b0C, 175 mL (189 g, 1.86 mol) of acetic anhydride (Note 2) is added. When the temperature rise has ceased, 44.0 g of 1-decene (0.312 mol) (Note 3) is introduced, followed at once by 250 g of anhydrous sodium acetate. The reaction mixture is then heated to reflux (134\u00b0C pot temperature). After 2 hr of reflux under nitrogen the reaction mixture, now clear yellow, is diluted with 1 L of water. The crude product is extracted into 200 mL of benzene, and the aqueous layer again washed with 100 mL of benzene. Benzene is distilled from the combined extracts to give 55.1 g of lactone and 1-decene. 1-Decene is removed by vacuum distillation, followed by the lactone, which distills at 98\u201399\u00b0C (0.05 mm) (Note 4). The yield of \u03b3-(n-octyl)-\u03b3-butyrolactone is 34.1 g (66% based on potassium permanganate. However, the lactone yield based on olefin consumed is greater than 95%.)"

(R,R)-( + )-N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyltartaric acid diamide. Into a mixture of 618 g (3 mol) of diethyl tartrate (Note 1) and 600 mL of freshly distilled methanol in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask is poured at least 450 mL (7 mol) of liquid, anhydrous, cold (\u221278\u00b0C) dimethylamine (Note 2). The mixture is swirled briefly and then allowed to stand in a hood for 3 days with a drying tube in place. After seeding (Note 3) and cooling in a refrigerator overnight, the massive crystals are collected by suction filtration. The filtrate is concentrated, seeded, and cooled to yield a second crop. The combined crystals are washed with cold methanol (\u221230\u00b0C) and dried under reduced pressure at 70\u2013100\u00b0C (oil bath). The diamide thus obtained is sufficiently pure to be used in the following step. The yield is 570\u2013580 g (93\u201395%). Recrystallization from methanol\u2013ethyl acetate furnishes an analytically pure sample, mp 189\u2013190\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D +43\u00b0 (ethanol, c 3.0).\nB. (R,R)-( + )-2,3-Dimethoxy-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylsuccinic acid diamide. Into a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and stopper, are introduced 240 mL of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide (3 mol), 1.5 L of methylene chloride, 0.2 g of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (TEBA), and then 260 g (2.06 mol) of dimethyl sulfate (Note 4). The mixture is stirred vigorously (Note 5), and a total of 204 g (1 mol) of the powdered tartaric acid diamide is added in portions at such a rate as to maintain refluxing (Note 6). Stirring is continued for 24 hr without heating, whereupon 1 L of water is added. Separation of the organic phase, extraction of the aqueous layer with three 300-mL portions of methylene chloride, drying of the combined organic solutions over sodium sulfate, and removal of the solvent in a rotary evaporator (bath temperature below 80\u00b0C, water aspirator vacuum) furnishes a slightly yellow oil that crystallizes at 25\u00b0C and is sufficiently pure for use in the following reduction step. Recrystallization from cyclohexane/benzene yields 220 g (95%, (Note 7)) of colorless prisms, mp 63.2\u201363.5\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D + 116\u00b0 (benzene, c 3).\nC.

A 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a heating jacket, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with drying tube, and a stoppered, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, flushed with nitrogen or argon, and charged with 2.2 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 8)) and 60 g (1.6 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4, (Note 9)). A mixture of 250 mL of THF and 232 g (1.0 mol) of the diamide is added, with stirring, at a rate sufficient to reach and maintain refluxing. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is kept boiling for 2 hr. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 60 mL of water, 180 mL of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide, and again 60 mL of water are added cautiously with very vigorous stirring. The hydrogen gas that is generated is led well above the stirring motor into the hood exhaust. Temporarily, the slurry becomes viscous and difficult to stir; during this period addition has to be made extremely carefully. The pale yellow, completely hydrolyzed slurry is filtered by suction, the filter cake extracted twice by refluxing with THF in a round-bottomed flask, and the combined solutions are concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column; bp 62\u201364\u00b0C (3 mm), yield 180 g (88%). For use in organometallic reactions, DDB is freshly distilled from LiAlH4, [\u03b1]D + 14.7\u00b0 (neat), d420 0.896 (Note 10)."

Into a 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, 1-L addition funnel, and reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen-inlet tube are introduced 44.8 g (0.4 mol) of powdered potassium tert-butoxide (Note 1) and 1 L of olefin-free petroleum ether (bp 35\u201355\u00b0C; (Note 2)). To this stirred mixture is added a solution containing 38.0 g (0.35 mol) of 1,2-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (Note 3) in 200 mL of the same solvent. With external cooling from an ice bath and under nitrogen, 102.4 g (0.4 mol) of bromoform in 400 mL of petroleum ether is added dropwise during 1 hr. The ice bath is removed and the resultant slurry is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 6 hr. Water (500 mL) is added and the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 300 mL of benzene. The organic layer is washed with four 500-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Note 4). Further evacuation at 0.5 mm produces a solid that is recrystallized from ether\u2013petroleum ether (1 : 3) to afford 55\u201362 g (56.5\u201363.5%) of colorless solid, mp 95\u201398\u00b0C (Note 5).\nB. 1,6-Dimethyltricyclo[4,1.0.02,7]hept-3-ene. A solution of 20.95 g (0.075 mol) of 7,7-dibromo-1,6-dimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene in 500 mL of anhydrous ether is placed in a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, addition funnel, and nitrogen-inlet tube. With stirring under nitrogen and external cooling in an ice bath, 50 mL of 1.6 M ethereal methyllithium (Note 6) in 70 mL of ether (0.08 mol) is introduced by dropwise addition during 30 min. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After 100 mL of water has been cautiously introduced, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. This solution is washed with water (3 \u00d7 100 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 7), and carefully concentrated by slow distillation through a 40-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure, heating at <60\u00b0C (Note 8). The residual liquid is distilled through a short, unpacked column to give 4.2\u20134.4 g (46\u201349%) of colorless oil, bp 48\u201349\u00b0C (23 mm) (Note 9). Under the proper conditions, this hydrocarbon can be stored for 2 weeks at \u22125\u00b0C without deterioration."

            "As shown in Figure 1, a dry, 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with an overhead stirrer bearing a four-bladed propeller of ca. 2.5-cm diameter driven by a strong, safely connected motor A (Note 1), a rubber septum, and a three-way stopcock. The air in the flask is replaced by dry argon or nitrogen, the pressure of which is maintained during the reaction at ca. 50 mm above atmospheric pressure with a mercury bubbler (Note 2). A second stirrer (motor B, Figure 1) to agitate the bath is attached next to the flask with the propeller just below the bottom of the flask. Finally, a 4.5-cm \u00d7 20-cm test tube is held next to the bath stirrer. The entire apparatus (Figure 1) is mounted well above the bench to allow for immersion of the flask, bath stirrer, and tube into cooling baths and for exchange of bulky bath containers with the aid of a lab jack. The flask is charged (Note 3) with 400 mL of 2-methylbutane (isopentane) (Note 4) and 24.6 g (27.5 mL, 0.12 mol) of (S,S)-( + )-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-diamino-2,3-dimethoxybutane (DDB) (Note 5). A methanol\u2013dry ice bath is raised to immerse the flask and cool the contents to \u221278\u00b0C with slow stirring, whereupon 0.021 mol of butyllithium (13.5 mL of a 1.56 M solution in hexane) (Note 6) is added within a few minutes. A second cooling bath is prepared in a ca. 7-L Dewar cylinder (Note 7) by pouring liquid nitrogen into a stirred (glass rod) mixture of methylcyclohexane/isopentane (3 : 2) (Note 8) until about half of the liquid has solidified and a slush has been formed, the temperature of which is ca. \u2212140\u00b0C (Note 9). The reaction flask is cooled to the lower temperature by exchanging baths and waiting for 15 min with bath stirring. The bath is temporarily lowered and cooled until again half frozen by pouring in liquid nitrogen and manual agitation (Note 10). From then on, cooling is kept constant by filling the tube in the stirred bath at intervals with liquid nitrogen (Note 10). A solution of 2.12 g (0.020 mol) of benzaldehyde (Note 11) in 20 mL of isopentane (Note 4) is added dropwise (Note 12) over 15 min to the vigorously stirred (ca. 1000 rpm) reaction mixture. After completion of the addition (ca. 0.5 hr), the bath is removed, the flask is warmed to ca. 0\u00b0C (Note 13), and the contents are poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 150 mL of ice-cold 2 N aqueous hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with 70 mL of hexane and saved for recovery of the chiral auxiliary agent DDB (Note 14). The combined organic layers are sequentially washed with saturated aqueous bicarbonate and sodium chloride solutions and concentrated in a rotary evaporator to ca. 200 mL. The solution is then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and vigorously shaken with 40 mL of a saturated aqueous sodium bisulfite solution to precipitate the bisulfite adduct of unreacted benzaldehyde (Note 15). After filtration (if necessary) the residue and the aqueous phase are washed with hexane. The combined organic solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Simple distillation yields 2.60\u20132.95 g (80\u201390%) of 1-phenyl-1-pentanol, bp 54\u201356\u00b0C (0.02 mm), [\u03b1]D = 6.13\u00b0 (neat), (Note 16), optical yield 30% (Note 17).\nFigure 1"

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, fraction collector, cold-finger condenser, and two thermometers. Into the flask are placed 55.0 g (0.25 mol) of diethyl bis(hydroxymethyl)malonate (Note 1) and 142 mL (1.25 mol) of 47\u201349% hydrobromic acid (Note 2). The mixture is then heated and the temperature of the liquid maintained between 85 and 90\u00b0C. A mixture of ethyl bromide and water distills during the course of 1.5\u20132 hr. The residue is then boiled for 10 hr, maintaining the temperature between 85\u201390\u00b0C (Note 3). At the end of this period, the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 65\u201370\u00b0C (10\u201315 mm). About 100 mL of water is removed. The residue is cooled in the refrigerator overnight. Crystals of \u03b1-(bromomethyl)acrylic acid are filtered in the cold (Note 4) to give, after drying (Note 5), 17.9 g (43%) of acid, mp 71\u201373\u00b0C (Note 6).\nB. Ethyl \u03b1-(bromomethyl)acrylate. In a nitrogen-flushed, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, Dean-Stark trap, and condenser are placed 42.0 g (0.25 mol) of \u03b1-(bromomethyl)acrylic acid and 300 mL of benzene. Approximately 50 mL of a binary azeotrope of benzene and water is distilled (Note 7). The Dean-Stark trap is removed and 100 mL of absolute ethanol (Note 8) and 1 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid are added slowly. The contents of the flask are boiled in a nitrogen atmosphere for 36 hr, the condensate being passed through 100 g of molecular sieves (Linde 3A) before being returned to the flask. About 125 mL of a mixture of benzene and ethanol is removed from the reaction mixture by distillation (at 67\u00b0C). Then 100 mL of benzene is added and another 125 mL of benzene-ethanol mixture distilled (67\u201375\u00b0C). The residue is poured into 200 mL of water and neutralized with solid sodium bicarbonate (ca. 10\u201315 g) until CO2 evolution ceases. The resulting solution is extracted with three 75-mL portions of ether, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for 3 hr. The ether is removed under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, and crude ester distilled to give a fraction at 39\u201340\u00b0C (0.9 mm) that weighs 33\u201334 g (71%).

            "A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a 2.5-cm magnetic stirring bar is equipped with a Dewar-type reflux condenser containing ice, a dropping funnel, and a gas inlet tube. A calcium chloride drying tube is attached to the condenser and the apparatus is flushed with dry deoxygenated nitrogen (Note 1). The gas inlet tube is then replaced by a thermometer, and a suspension of 5.0 g of aluminum trichloride in 50 mL of benzene is introduced into the flask (Note 2). A solution of 100 g (1.85 mol) of 2-butyne (Note 3) and (Note 4) in 50 mL of cold dry benzene is added, with vigorous stirring, through the dropping funnel, over a period of 1 hr. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 30 and 40\u00b0C through the use of a water bath. Stirring is continued for 5 hr at 30\u201340\u00b0C after the addition has been completed. The catalyst is then decomposed by pouring the mixture onto 50 g of crushed ice in a 500-mL separatory funnel, whereupon the dark brown color turns pale yellow. When the ice has melted completely, the organic layer is separated, washed with two 25-mL portions of cold water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Benzene and unreacted butyne (Note 5) are removed in a rotary evaporator using a water bath at 40\u00b0C and a water aspirator vacuum. The residual liquid is distilled through a short-path distillation head under reduced pressure using a capillary. The yield is 38\u201350 g (38\u201350%) of hexamethyl Dewar benzene, bp 43\u00b0C/10 mm, mp 7\u20138\u00b0C, nD20 1.4480 (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

In a well-ventilated hood, a solution of 18.98 g (231.2 mmol) of 2-cyclopentenone (Note 1) in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added to a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and an addition funnel. The solution is chilled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath and a solution of 40.5 g (253.4 mmol, 13.0 mL) of bromine in 150 mL of carbon tetrachlorideis added dropwise during 1 hr. Then a solution of 35.1 g (346.8 mmol, 48.3 mL) of triethylamine in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added dropwise over 1 hr with vigorous stirring while the reaction is held at 0\u00b0C. Stirring is continued for an additional 2 hr at room temperature; the resulting dark suspension is filtered with suction and the filtercake washed with carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate and washings are combined and washed with two 100-mL portions of 2 N hydrochloric acid, one 100-mL portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, one 100-mL portion of water, and one 100-mL portion of saturated sodium chloride solution. The resultant solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Distillation of the resultant oil (69\u201378\u00b0C, 1.0 mm) afforded 23.7 g (147.2 mmol, 64%) (Note 2) of a white crystalline solid, mp 36\u201337\u00b0C, (lit.2 mp 39\u201339.5\u00b0C) (Note 3).\nB. 2-Bromo-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal. A solution of 22.00 g (136.7 mmol) of freshly distilled 2-bromo-2-cyclopentenone, 21.80 g (351.2 mmol) of ethylene glycol, 1.5 L of benzene (Note 4), and 60 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is heated at reflux for 64 hr (Note 5), with azeotropic removal of water, in a 3-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Dean-Stark trap, condenser, and Drierite drying tube. The solution is cooled to room temperature, dried with potassium carbonate, and filtered by vacuum through 15 g of Celite. The filtercake is washed with 150 mL of benzene. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure yields a mobile yellow oil. Distillation (65\u201367\u00b0C, 0.7 mm) affords 22.4 g (109.0 mmol, 80%) (Note 6) of the ketal (Note 7).\nC. 2-Hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone. The apparatus, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Note 8), is flame-dried while dry nitrogen is passed through. Paraformaldehyde (13 g, 433 mmol) (Note 9) is then added to the 250-mL flask (the generator) and 19.4 g (94.6 mmol) of freshly distilled 2-bromo-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal in 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran containing 2 mg of 2,2'-bipyridyl (Note 10) is added to the 500-mL flask (the reaction flask). The reaction flask is chilled to \u221278\u00b0C with an acetone/dry ice bath and 46.0 mL (105.8 mmol) of butyllithium (2.3 M in hexane) (Note 11) is added dropwise by syringe through the rubber septum during 1 hr. The resultant red solution is stirred for 1 hr and then warmed to \u221230\u00b0C using a methanol\u2013water (2 : 3)/dry ice bath. An oil bath previously heated to 160\u00b0C is applied to the generator and the monomeric formaldehyde thus generated is bubbled into the reaction mixture via a steady stream of dry nitrogen until the red color of the indicator is discharged (approximately 45 min). The reaction is quenched by the addition of 10 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and the resultant mixture is poured into 100 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution. This mixture is extracted four times with 100-mL portions of methylene chloride; the methylene chloride extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure affords 8.1\u201310.7 g (Note 12) of crude 2-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal as a viscous liquid (Note 13).\nFigure 1\nWithout purification, 8.1 g of the above crude ketal is added to a solution consisting of 1.0 g of oxalic acid, 5 mL of water, and 40 mL of methylene chloride. The resultant mixture is stirred for 5 hr at room temperature. At the end of this period the solution is filtered through 50 g of magnesium sulfate impregnated with 1.0 g of potassium carbonate (Note 14). Evaporation of the solvent from the filtrate affords a solid which, after purification by short-path distillation (70\u201380\u00b0C, 0.1 mm) (Note 15), gives 4.9 g (46%, based on bromoketal) (Note 16) of pure 2-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone, mp 68\u201369\u00b0C (off-white crystals) (Note 17) and (Note 18)."

            "Caution! Because of the volatility and toxic nature of OsO4, these reactions should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood.\nA. cis-2-p(Toluenesulfonamido)cyclohexanol. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 8.2 g (0.1 mol) of cyclohexene (Note 1), 250 mL of reagent grade chloroform (Note 2), and 10 mL (1 mmol) of osmium tetroxide catalyst solution (Note 3). To the resulting black solution is added a solution of 35.2 g (0.125 mol) of chloramine-T trihydrate (Note 4) and 1.1 g (5 mmol) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (Note 5) in 250 mL of distilled water. Vigorous stirring is begun, and the reaction mixture is brought to 55\u201360\u00b0C by means of a heating mantle.\nAfter 10 hr at 55\u201360\u00b0C, 14.2 g (0.1 mol) of sodium sulfite (Note 6) is added and the mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. The hot reaction mixture (Note 7) is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 10 min. The organic layer is collected in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 25 mL of CHCl3 that is then combined with the original organic layer. Removal of solvent with a rotary evaporator provides a residue (Note 8) that is transferred to a 350-mL fritted-glass funnel and triturated successively with 200 mL and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide (Note 9) and finally with two 50-mL portions of distilled water.\nThe resulting solid is placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in a mixture of 250 mL of CHCl3 and 25 mL of CH3OH. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (ca. 8\u201310 g) is added and the resulting suspension is stirred magnetically for 5 min. Filtration of this suspension through a Celite mat on a sintered-glass funnel (Note 10), followed by evaporation of the solvent, affords (after drying under reduced pressure) 20.3\u201322 g (75\u201381.2%) of almost pure cis-2-(p-toluenesulfonamido)cyclohexanol, mp 155\u2013157\u00b0C (Note 11). The oxyaminated product may be purified further by washing with toluene to give 20\u201321.8 g (74.3\u201380.9%); mp 157\u2013158\u00b0C (Note 12).\nB. 2-Methyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonamido)-2-pentanol. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 8.4 g (0.1 mol) of 2-methyl-2-pentene (Note 1), 100 mL of reagent-grade tert-butyl alcohol (Note 2), 10 mL (1 mmol) of osmium tetroxide catalyst solution (Note 3), and 35.2 g (0.125 mol) of chloramine-T trihydrate (Note 4). Vigorous stirring is begun, and the reaction mixture is brought to 55\u201360\u00b0C by means of a heating mantle.\nAfter ca. 20 hr at 55\u201360\u00b0C, the mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, and then 1.1 g (0.03 mol) of sodium borohydride is added (Note 6). Stirring is continued at room temperature for about 1 hr. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives an oil that is taken up in 100 mL of ethyl acetate and washed once with a solution that is prepared by mixing 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide (Note 13) with 25 mL of distilled water. The organic layer is washed twice more with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide and finally with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution (Note 9) and (Note 14). Addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtration through a column of 75 g of silica gel (Note 15), elution with ethyl acetate (Note 16), and evaporation of the solvent on a rotary evaporator provides 21.5 g of the crude oxyaminated product (Note 17). The solid is then washed twice with ether (Note 18) to give 13.8\u201314.9 g (51\u201355%) of white, crystalline 2-methyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonamido)-2-pentanol, mp 96\u201397\u00b0C. Concentration of the ether yields an additional 4.0\u20135.0 g (15\u201318%) of oxyaminated product, mp 95\u201397\u00b0C (Note 19)."

            "A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL addition funnel. The flask is placed in an ice bath and charged with 13.36 g (0.15 mol) of ethyl carbamate (Note 1) and 100 mL of reagent-grade methanol. Vigorous stirring is begun and to the ice-cold solution is carefully added 16.9 mL (16.2 g, 0.15 mol) of tert-butyl hypochlorite (Note 2). Fifteen minutes after the addition of the tert-butyl hypochlorite is complete, a methanolic solution (75 mL) of sodium hydroxide (6.43 g, 0.158 mol) is added dropwise over a period of several minutes (Note 3). After addition of the sodium hydroxide is complete, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for a further 10 min. The solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator (bath <60\u00b0C) to give the crude ethyl N-chloro-N-sodiocarbamate as a white solid (Note 4). Addition of 400 mL of reagent-grade acetonitrile and 26.33 g (0.1 mol) of silver nitrate (Note 5) results in the gradual appearance of a brown suspension. The solution is stirred for 5 min at room temperature; 18.23 g (0.1 mol) of (E)-stilbene (Note 6), 10 mL (~ 1.0 mmol) of a solution of OsO4 in tert-butyl alcohol (Note 7), and 8.1 mL (0.45 mol) of water are then added. The milky brown suspension that results is stirred for 18 hr at room temperature. Filtration of the reaction mixture through a Celite mat on a sintered-glass funnel gives a yellow\u2013brown solution (Note 8). The filtrate is refluxed for 3 hr with 200 mL of 5% aqueous sodium sulfite (Note 9). The resulting mixture is concentrated at aspirator pressure using a rotary evaporator until acetonitrile no longer distills. The residue, which is primarily aqueous, is extracted with two 60-mL portions of methylene chloride (Note 10). The organic phase is dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give 24.6 g of crude product as a pale-yellow solid. Crystallization from 50 mL of hot toluene affords 18.6\u201319.8 g (66\u201369%) of almost pure ethyl threo-1-(2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethyl)carbamate, mp 120\u2013122\u00b0C (Note 11).

            "Caution! 3,1-Benzoxazepine is a strong lacrimator and a moderate skin irritant. The preparation should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood. The apparatus should be shielded to avoid exposure to ultraviolet light.\nBenzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nIrradiation is carried out in a round-bottomed, cylindrical, Pyrex vessel (Note 1) equipped with a Pyrex immersion well (Note 2), nitrogen inlet, distillation sidearm, a small sidearm fitted with a rubber septum for removing aliquots, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with 12 g (0.066 mol) (Note 3) of quinoline N-oxide dihydrate (Note 4) and 1.3 L of dry benzene (Note 5). The mixture is stirred and heated to boiling with a heating mantle as a slow stream of nitrogen (Note 6) is bubbled into the vessel. Benzene is distilled through the sidearm until the distillate is perfectly clear (Note 7). The lamp (Note 8) is placed in the immersion well, water is circulated through the cooling jacket, and the nitrogen flow is adjusted as necessary to maintain an outward flow of gas while the light yellow solution cools to room temperature (Note 9). The solution is stirred vigorously (Note 10) and irradiated for 2.5\u20133 hr, at which time the N-oxide is largely consumed (Note 11). The orange solution is transferred to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, and the benzene is removed by rotary evaporation at room temperature. The red-orange oily residue, which contains some solid, is extracted with three 40-mL portions of dry cyclohexane, the combined cyclohexane extracts are evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and the extraction operation is repeated on the oil thus obtained (Note 12). Evaporation of the combined cyclohexane extracts affords 6.1\u20136.3 g (63\u201365%) of crude 3,1-benzoxazepine (Note 13). Bulb-to-bulb distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 0.2 mm with an oven temperature of 80\u00b0C affords 4.7\u20134.8 g (49\u201350%) of 3,1-benzoxazepine as a pale yellow oil, nD24 1.6074 (Note 14) and (Note 15)."

            "Caution! The products used and formed in Step A are extremely pyrophoric. Great care should be taken in conducting this step.\nA. cis,trans-Perhydro-9b-boraphenalene. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a septum, thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and a 12-cm Vigreux column. A 2-L, two-necked receiving flask is attached to the Vigreux column and fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube that is attached to a mercury bubbler device to permit a positive pressure on the system (Note 1). The entire system is flushed with nitrogen and, while the system is maintained under a static pressure of nitrogen, 500 mL (0.050 mol) of a 1.0 M solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 2)) is added to the reaction flask by means of a syringe. The flask is immersed in an ice\u2013water bath, stirring is begun, and 50.6 g (0.50 mol) of triethylamine (Note 3) is added slowly over 15 min. After the addition is completed, the THF is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure and 300 mL of dry diglyme (Note 4) is added. The resulting solution is heated to 130\u2013140\u00b0C and a solution of 81 g (0.50 mol) of trans,trans,trans-1,5,9-cyclododecatriene (Note 5) in 100 mL of dry diglyme (Note 6) is added over 2 hr. At the end of this time, the diglyme is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure and the residual oil is heated at 200\u00b0C for 6 hr (Note 7). After the reaction is cooled, the thermally treated product is used directly in Step B (Note 8). Product free of polymeric impurity can be obtained by distillation (Note 9) and (Note 10).\nB. cis,cis,trans-2-(Perhydro-9'b-phenalyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborole. The 250-mL pressure vessel (Note 11) is fitted with a cap bearing a rubber septum. Two hypodermic needles are inserted into the vessel through the septum, one with the end close to the bottom of the vessel and the other with the end close to the top. The vessel is flushed with nitrogen, with the exit gas passing through a mercury bubbler device. One-fifth of the thermally treated, undistilled product obtained from Step A is dissolved in 50 mL of dry THF (Note 12) and added to the vessel by means of a syringe while a static pressure of nitrogen is maintained on the vessel. Ethylene glycol (18.6 g, 16.8 mL, 0.30 mol) (Note 13) is then added. The rubber septum is removed and the vessel is quickly connected to a cylinder of carbon monoxide (Note 14) and placed in a heating device capable of agitation. The vessel is agitated and the pressure increased with carbon monoxide to ca. 70 atm (ca. 1000 psi); the temperature is raised to 150\u00b0C. The vessel is maintained at this temperature for 2 hr and then cooled to room temperature and opened to the air. The contents of the vessel are transferred to a flask; the vessel is rinsed with two 50-mL portions of pentane, and the pentane is added to the product. The resulting solution is washed with 50 mL of water and dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the pentane removed by distillation to give 19.4 g of cis,cis,trans-2-(perhydro-9'b-phenalyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborole, a solid that can be further purified by recrystallization from pentane, mp 101\u2013102\u00b0C (Note 15).\nC. cis,cis,trans-Perhydro-9b-phenalenol. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a septum, thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser, which is connected to a nitrogen inlet and a mercury bubbler device. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and 50 mL of THF, 100 mL of 95% ethanol, and 19.4 g (0.0782 mol) of cis,cis,trans-2-(perhydro-9'b-phenalyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborole from Step B are added to the flask together with 37 mL (0.220 mol, 120% excess) of 6 N sodium hydroxide. The solution is stirred and, by means of a dropping funnel, 37 mL (~0.326 mol) of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Note 16) is added at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 40\u00b0C. After the initial reaction has subsided, the reaction mixture is heated for 2 hr at 50\u00b0C to assure complete oxidation (Note 17). At the end of this time, 300 mL of pentane is added. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the organic layer is separated and washed three times with 50-mL portions of water and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture is filtered, and the solvent is removed by distillation to yield a solid (Note 18) which is recrystallized from cold pentane to give 10.9 g (71.7%) of cis,cis,trans-perhydro-9b-phenalenol, mp 75\u201376\u00b0C (Note 19)."

Tubing attachments are made so that water is circulated through the condenser and then through the Vycor filter sleeve. The tube leading from the bottom of the reaction vessel and containing the glass frit is connected in series to a trap fitted with a fritted filter stick and then to a trap that is connected to a nitrogen source. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and sufficient anhydrous methanol is placed in the trap containing the fritted stick to provide for a methanol-saturated gas stream during the course of the reaction (Note 1).\nFigure 1\nThe nitrogen-flushed reactor is charged with a solution of 20.0 g (147 mmol) of ( + )-limonene (Note 2), 5.0 g (53 mmol) (Note 3) of phenol, and 5 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid in 210 mL (167 g, 5.2 mol) of anhydrous methanol (Note 4). Water flow through the condenser is started (Note 5), and the nitrogen flow is adjusted to provide good agitation of the contents of the vessel. After 15 min, irradiation is started and the reaction followed by GLC (Note 6), with 48 hr being the approximate time needed for essentially complete conversion (Note 7).\nThe solution is poured into 900 mL of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution containing 125 g of sodium chloride, and the mixture is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether.

A dry, 250-mL flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, syringe port (Note 7), and argon outlet is flushed three times with argon. To the flask are added 40 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1.17 mL (8.4 mmol) of dry diisopropylamine (Note 8). The flask is cooled in an acetone\u2013dry-ice bath while 7.4 mmol of butyllithium in hexane (Note 9) is added dropwise with stirring. After the addition is complete, the solution is allowed to warm for 15 min. The flask is then cooled in an ice\u2013water bath. To this solution is added 1.61 g (4.6 mmol) of 17\u03b2-tert-butoxy-5\u03b1-androstan-3-one in 30 mL of 2:1 THF/DMPU (Note 8) solution. The reaction mixture is stirred with ice cooling for 15 min. N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyldiamidophosphorochloridate, 5.83 mL (0.038 mol) (Note 10), is added dropwise with stirring. After 15 min, the bath is removed; the flask is allowed to warm to 25\u00b0C and is stirred for an additional 2 hr. The excess reagent is hydrolyzed by slow addition of 30 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and stirring for 30 min. After three extractions with 100-mL portions of diethyl ether, the combined organic layers are washed twice with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the ether is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to afford 2.9\u20133.0 g of a crude yellow solid (Note 11). The crude phosphorodiamidate is dissolved in 40 mL of dry THF and added to a dry, three-necked, 250-mL flask equipped with overhead stirrer, cold finger condenser (acetone\u2013dry ice), argon bubbler, and acetone\u2013dry-ice bath. Dry ammonia is distilled into the flask until the phosphorodiamidate begins to precipitate. The bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to reflux. Dry tert-butyl alcohol (1.75 mL, (Note 12)) is added in one portion. To the clear solution is added 1.5 cm of 1/8-in., cleaned lithium wire in 0.3-cm portions. The blue color is maintained (by the addition of lithium wire if necessary) with stirring for 4 hr and then allowing the stirred solution to warm to room temperature overnight. Sodium benzoate is added in 25-mg portions until the blue color is discharged. Ammonium chloride (0.50 g) is added in one portion, the condenser removed, and the ammonia allowed to evaporate. The residue is taken up in 100 mL of diethyl ether and 100 mL of water. The layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The ether is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The crude olefin is filtered through 15 g of silica gel (Note 13) using benzene\u2013ethyl acetate (2:1) as eluant, to give an off-white solid that is recrystallized from a minimum amount of absolute ethanol to give, after drying, 1.0 g (67%) (Note 14) of 17\u03b2-tert-butoxy-5\u03b1-androst-2-ene, mp 114\u2013117\u00b0C (Note 15)."

            "Caution! Ethyl bromoacetate is intensely irritating to eyes and skin. The preparation of this ester should be carried out in an efficient hood. Caution! Benzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA. Ethyl trimethylsilylacetate (Note 1). In a 3-L, three-necked flask fitted with a 1-L, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and efficient condenser that is connected to a nitrogen source are placed 97.5 g (1.5 mol) of zinc powder (Note 2) and 14.9 g (0.15 mol) of cuprous chloride (Note 3). After the reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen, a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained for the remainder of the reaction. A mixture of 150 mL of benzene (Note 5) is added to the flask, and the resulting mixture is refluxed with stirring for 30 min with the aid of an electric heating mantle. Heating is discontinued and a solution of 109 g (128 mL, 1.0 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 6) and 184 g (123 mL, 1.1 mol) of ethyl bromoacetate (Note 7) in a mixture of 90 mL of ether and 350 mL of benzene is promptly added through the dropping funnel at such a rate as to maintain the reaction at gentle reflux. The addition takes about 1 hr. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr and then cooled in an ice bath. While the mixture is stirred, 300 mL of aqueous 5% hydrochloric acid is added through the dropping funnel over a 10-min period. The liquid layer is decanted into a 3-L separatory funnel and the flask is washed with two 100-mL portions of ether. The ether solutions are added to the separatory funnel, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The organic phases are combined and washed twice with 200-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, twice with 200-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and finally with 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the mixture is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of about 400 mL. The residual yellow liquid is distilled in a 30-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure until the boiling point is 90\u00b0C. The remaining liquid is distilled at reduced pressure to give, after a small forerun, 101\u2013108 g (63\u201374%, (Note 8)) of ethyl trimethylsilylacetate, bp 93\u201394\u00b0C (104 mm), nD20 1.4152\u20131.4154 (Note 9).\nB. (Z)-3-Trimethylsiloxy-2-pentene. In a dry, 200-mL flask (Note 10) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a three-way stopcock, one exit of which is capped with a small rubber septum, is quickly placed 1.5 g (ca. 6 mmol) of dried tetrabutylammonium fluoride hydrate (Note 11). With the aid of a hypodermic syringe, 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 12) is added through the septum, and the clear solution is stirred. After 5 min, the reaction vessel is immersed in a hexane/dry ice bath, and 38.4 g (0.240 mol) of ethyl trimethylsilylacetate is added during 10 min through a syringe that is rinsed with 15 mL of dry THF. After 10 min a solution of 17.2 g (0.200 mol) of 3-pentanone (Note 13) in 15 mL of dry THF is introduced during 10 min to the stirred solution with the aid of a syringe, which is then rinsed with 5 mL of dry THF. The clear solution is stirred for 3 hr, then warmed gradually to 0\u00b0C over about 1 hr and finally the temperature is held at 0\u00b0C for 2\u20134 hr (Note 14). Meanwhile, 400 mL of pentane (Note 15) in a dry, nitrogen-filled, 1-L flask equipped with a drying tube and a magnetic stirring bar is cooled with stirring in a hexane/dry ice bath, and the dark-orange reaction mixture is poured into it. The reaction vessel is rinsed with three 50-mL portions of pentane. The pentane rinses are added to the reaction solution and the resulting mixture is filtered through a pad of Hyflo Super Cell on a sintered-glass filter, and the filtrate is washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is remove by filtration, and the resulting solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at room temperature to a volume of 150 mL. The remaining liquid is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column. After a very small amount of forerun ( < 1 g), 21.9\u201324.1 g (69\u201376%) of 3-trimethylsiloxy-2-pentene is obtained, bp 139\u2013142\u00b0C; nD20 1.4133\u20131.4135 (Note 16)."

            "Caution! The following reactions should be performed in an efficient hood to protect the experimentalist from noxious vapors (piperidine and methyl vinyl ketone).\nA. 1-(Cyclooctylidenemethyl)piperidine. Cyclooctanecarboxaldehyde (12.5 g, 0.089 mol) (Note 1) and piperidine (8.35 g, 0.098 mol) are dissolved in 115 mL of toluene and placed in a 250-mL, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and Dean-Stark water separator, on top of which is a condenser fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube. The reaction mixture is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, then brought to and maintained at reflux with stirring for 6 hr, at which time the theoretical amount of water (1.75 mL) has been collected. The reaction mixture is cooled and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure (Note 2); toluene and excess piperidine are removed at 40\u00b0C (0.5 mm), and the enamine product is distilled as a colorless liquid to yield 17.30 g (0.084 mol, 93.6%) of 1-(cyclooctylidenemethyl)piperidine, bp 81\u201383\u00b0C (0.5 mm).\nB. Spiro[5.7]tridec-1-en-3-one. A dry, 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a Teflon stirring bar, condenser, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and nitrogen-inlet tube. To this flask are introduced absolute ethanol (460 mL) (Note 3) and 1-(cyclooctylidenemethyl)piperidine (17.3 g. 0.084 mol). After the solution has been stirred for 5 min, methyl vinyl ketone (6.44 g, 0.092 mol) (Note 4) is added dropwise over a period of 5 min. The solution is refluxed for 20 hr using a heating mantle. The mixture is cooled and anhydrous sodium acetate (15.0 g), acetic acid (25.5 mL), and water (46 mL) are added. The mixture is brought to and maintained at reflux for 8 hr. The heat is removed and the solution is cooled with ice water; aqueous sodium hydroxide (20% solution, approximately 65 mL) is added until pH 9\u201310 is attained. The solution is refluxed for another 15 hr; at the end of this period the reaction mixture is cooled. The reaction mixture (600 mL) is divided equally into two 2-L separatory funnels and each portion is diluted with 600 mL of ice-cold water. Each separatory funnel is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 125 mL). The ether extract is washed successively with aqueous 5% hydrochloric acid (125 mL) and saturated brine (3 \u00d7 170 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the product is distilled under vacuum (Note 5) as a colorless liquid to yield 7.05\u20137.75 g (44\u201349%) of spiro[5.7]tridec-1-en-3-one, bp 95\u2013125\u00b0C (0.5 mm) (Note 6).\nC.

Rubber gloves and laboratory coats should be worn, and reactions should be carried out in an efficient hood. Thallium wastes should be collected and disposed of separately.3\nA. Thallium(I) 2-methylpropane-2-thiolate. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which a nitrogen inlet adapter is attached is charged with 47.2 g (0.189 mol) of thallium(I) ethoxide (Note 1) and 200 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 2). Over a period of 15 min 19.2 g (24 mL, 0.213 mol) of 2-methylpropane-2-thiol (Note 1) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hr and the resulting precipitate is collected by filtration. After washing with three 100-mL portions of anhydrous pentane (Note 3), 48.5\u201351.2 g (90\u201395%) of the product is obtained as bright yellow crystals, mp 165\u2013170\u00b0C dec (Note 4). This material is sufficiently pure for use in the following steps.\nB. S-tert-Butyl cyclohexanecarbothioate. A solution of 4.38 g (0.030 mol) of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid chloride (Note 5) in 150 mL of ether (Note 6) is placed in a dry, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a gas inlet. The system is flushed with nitrogen and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. Stirring is initiated and 8.82 g (0.031 mol) of the thallium(I) 2-methylpropane-2-thiolate prepared in Step A is added. After the resulting milky suspension is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, the fine precipitate is removed by filtration through Celite (Note 7) and washed thoroughly with four 50-mL portions of ether. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a pale-yellow oil, which is distilled under reduced pressure through a 5-cm Vigreux column. After separation of a forerun, 5.36\u20135.44 g (90\u201391%) of the colorless thiol ester is collected, bp 100\u00b0C (7 mm) (Note 8).\nC. S-tert-Butyl ester from cholic acid. A dry, 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a nitrogen inlet adapter; the system is purged with, and maintained under, dry nitrogen. After 4.90 g (0.0120 mol) of cholic acid (Note 9), 1.33 g (0.0131 mol) of triethylamine (Note 10), and 60 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 11)) are placed in the flask, a stoppered, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with a solution of 2.18 g (0.0127 mol) of diethyl phosphorochloridate (Note 9) in 30 mL of dry THF is attached to the top of the nitrogen inlet adapter (see Figure 1). The solution is added to the stirred reaction mixture over a period of 5 min and stirring is continued for 3.5 hr at room temperature. The dropping funnel is removed, and the reaction mixture is taken up into a dry, 100-mL syringe and transferred to a dry filtering apparatus. This apparatus is shown in Figure 2. The glass-fritted filter funnel of medium porosity with a built-in vacuum adapter is connected to the middle neck of a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask. A calcium chloride drying tube is connected to the vacuum adapter and a nitrogen inlet adapter is attached to the top of the filter funnel. The precipitated triethylamine hydrochloride is now removed from the reaction mixture by stoppering the nitrogen inlet adapter and using the positive nitrogen pressure to force the solution through the glass frit. Dry tetrahydrofuran, 40 mL, is used to rinse the original reaction flask. The stopper of the nitrogen inlet adapter (Figure 2) is removed, and this washing is transferred via the same syringe to the filtering apparatus and forced through the filter in the same manner described above. One of the stoppers of the three-necked flask is replaced by a nitrogen inlet adapter and the filter funnel is replaced by a mechanical stirrer. As the filtrate is stirred at room temperature, the remaining stopper is removed and 3.90 g (0.0133 mol) of thallium(I) 2-methylpropane-2-thiolate is added. After the addition is complete, the neck is restoppered, and the resulting mixture is vigorously stirred under nitrogen at room temperature overnight. The precipitate is removed by suction filtration through Celite filter aid (Note 7) and washed with three 30-mL portions of THF. The filtrate and washings are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue is dissolved in 160 mL of ethyl acetate. This solution is washed with two 100-mL portions of aqueous 5% NaHCO3, then with 50 mL of aqueous saturated NaCl, and finally is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporator to afford a white, gummy paste which crystallizes upon trituration with 20 mL of acetonitrile.

            "A. d-Camphor 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonylhydrazone. In a 500-mL Erlen-meyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 66.0 g (0.22 mol) of 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonylhydrazide (Note 1), 30.4 g (0.20 mol) of d-camphor (Note 2), 100 mL of freshly distilled acetonitrile, and 20.0 mL (0.24 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution is stirred overnight while a granular solid precipitates. The white crystals are cooled at \u221210\u00b0C for 4 hr and collected by suction filtration, dissolved in 175 mL of dichloromethane, filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble material, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to give 60.8\u201363.4 g (70\u201373%) of a white solid, mp 196\u2013199\u00b0C (dec) (Note 3).\nB. 2-Butylbornene. A 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a 250-mL addition funnel (sealed with a rubber septum), a mechanical stirrer, and a rubber septum. The system is vented (via a hypodermic needle inserted through the addition funnel septum) through a mineral oil bubbler, and the apparatus is flame-dried while it is flushed with prepurified nitrogen introduced through the septum of the flask. The flask is charged with 40.0 g (0.092 mol) of d-camphor 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonylhydrazone, resealed, and again flushed with nitrogen. Hexane, 200 mL, (Note 4), and 200 mL of tetramethylethylenediamine (Note 5) are added, and the stirred solution, under an atmosphere of nitrogen, is cooled to approximately \u221255\u00b0C with an ethanol\u2013water(2:1)/dry ice bath. Using a Luer-Lok syringe, 158 mL (0.20 mol) of 1.29 M sec-butyllithium (Note 6) is transferred to the addition funnel. The solution is stirred rapidly and the sec-butyllithium added over a period of 15\u201320 min. The resulting orange solution is stirred for 2 hr, and the cold bath removed. After 20 min the flask is immersed in an ice bath until nitrogen evolution ceases (approximately 10 min).\nTo this stirred solution of 2-lithiobornene is added, via syringe, 15.2 g (0.11 mol) of butyl bromide (Note 7) over a 1-min period. The ice bath is then removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture is poured into 500 mL of water. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with five 200-mL portions of water, one 50-mL portion of 1 N hydrochloric acid, and two 200-mL portions of water. The solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure and room temperature.

            "Caution! Benzene (see Section B) has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA. Preparation of the zinc chloride. Reagent-grade zinc chloride (50 g) is placed in an evaporating dish and heated in a fume hood with a Fisher burner until no more water vapor is driven off. The hot dish is rapidly transferred to a glove bag that has been maintained under nitrogen. After the zinc chloride has cooled to a transparent glassy solid, it is ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The solid is transferred to a tightly stoppered bottle and stored in a desiccator over Drierite.\nB. Preparation of 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene. Triethylamine (575 g, 5.7 mol) is stirred mechanically in a three-necked flask (Note 1). To this is added 10.0 g (0.07 mol) of zinc chloride prepared as described above. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 1 hr. A solution of 250 g (2.50 mol) of 4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one (from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.) in 750 mL of benzene is added all at once. Mechanical stirring is continued for 5 min. Chlorotrimethylsilane (542 g, 5.0 mol) is added rapidly. The reaction mixture first turns pink, then red, and finally brown. Heat is evolved and the reaction is kept below 45\u00b0C by cooling in an ice bath. After 30 min, the mechanically stirred solution is heated by a heating mantle to 43\u00b0C (Note 2). This temperature is maintained for 12 hr. The reaction mixture becomes very thick during this time. After the mixture cools to ambient temperature, it is poured, with mixing, into 5 L of ether. The solid material is filtered through Celite. The Celite and solid material are removed and stirred with 4 L more of ether and refiltered through Celite. The combined ether washings are evaporated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) to a brown, sweet-smelling oil. The oil is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked flask equipped with an 18-in. Vigreux column (Note 3). Careful fractional distillation under water vacuum affords a forerun of approximately 16 g that boils at 70\u201378\u00b0C (22 mm). This fraction consists of impure diene that contains 4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one. The main fraction boils at 78\u201381\u00b0C (23 mm) and consists of 245 g of diene (Note 4) with approximately 5\u201310% of 4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one (Note 5). This material is suitable for most purposes. If higher purity is desired, the second fraction may be redistilled under reduced pressure through an 18-in. Vigreux column to afford 200 g (46%) of trans-1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene (Note 6).\nC. 5\u03b2-Methoxycyclohexan-1-one-3\u03b2,4\u03b2-dicarboxylic acid anhydride. To 3.00 g (0.174 mol) of 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene at 0\u00b0C (ice bath) is added a total of 980 mg (0.01 mol) of freshly sublimed maleic anhydride in portions of 70\u201380 mg each over a period of 25 min. When the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the clear solution is stirred for 15 min at room temperature (Note 7). Three 5-mL portions of a solution of tetrahydrofuran (35 mL) and 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (15 mL) are added and the solution is stirred for 1 min. The remaining acid solution (35 mL) is added all at once and the resulting solution is poured into 100 mL of chloroform and treated with 25 mL of water. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted four times with 100-mL portions of chloroform. The extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is then removed under reduced pressure (Note 8) to provide 2.0 g of an oil which solidifies. Pentane (10 mL) is added to the oily solid and small portions of ether (total of 6 mL) are added; trituration is continued until the crystals become free flowing. The crystals are isolated by filtration and washed with 10 mL of 2 : 1 pentane/ether to afford 1.75 g (90%) of the anhydride, mp 87\u201389\u00b0C. Further recrystallization affords an analytically pure sample, mp 97\u201398\u00b0C."

A 500-mL flask (Figure 1) with a side arm is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and three-way stopcock, on top of which is attached a rubber balloon, D. A Pt-100-thermometer, E, is inserted into the flask through the septum (Note 1). The air in the flask is replaced by dry nitrogen (Note 2). The flask is charged with 10.8 g (0.0525 mol) of cuprous bromide\u2013dimethyl sulfide complex (Note 3) and 100 mL of ether, then immersed in a bath at \u221250\u00b0C; 0.10 mol of butyllithium, ca. 1.6 M solution in hexane (Note 4), is added dropwise, with stirring, via a syringe inserted through the rubber septum, at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed \u221220\u00b0C.\nFigure 1\nAfter the addition is complete, stirring is continued at \u221230\u00b0C for 10 min to produce a gray\u2013blue or dark-blue solution of the cuprate (Note 5).\nB. Preparation of a solution of lithium di(Z-hexenyl)cuprate. A needle connected to an acetylene supply (Note 6) is introduced through the rubber septum of the flask, with its end at least 1 cm below the surface of the cuprate solution. The stopcock is fully opened toward the balloon, the solution is cooled to \u221250\u00b0C, and 2.64 L (0.11 mol) of acetylene (Note 6) is bubbled into the stirred cuprate solution, the temperature of which should not rise above \u221225\u00b0C. The gas inlet is removed and the greenish solution is stirred at \u221225\u00b0C for 30 min.\nC. Preparation of Z-iodohexene. A dry, 100-mL flask with a sidearm is charged with 26.7 g (0.105 mol) of iodine, equipped with a stirring bar, three-way stopcock, and rubber septum, and flushed with argon as described above (Section A). The iodine is dissolved by introducing, with stirring, 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran through the septum with a syringe. Flask A, which contains the iodine solution, is connected to flask B, which contains the vinyl cuprate solution as shown in Figure 1. The cuprate solution is kept between \u221260\u00b0 and \u221250\u00b0C while the iodine solution is pushed through the Teflon tubing, C. Then the cooling bath is removed and the temperature is allowed to rise to \u221210\u00b0C, whereupon a precipitate of copper(I) iodide is formed and the mixture turns yellow. After 10 min at \u221210\u00b0C, a mixture of 100 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 10 mL of saturated sodium bisulfite is added with vigorous stirring. The mixture is filtered by suction through 10 g of Celite on a sintered-glass funnel (No. 3), the contents of the funnel are washed twice with 50 mL of ether, and the filtrate is separated into two layers (Note 7). The inorganic layer is washed twice with 50 mL of pentane, and the combined organic layers are washed with aqueous sodium bisulfite (Note 8) and saturated ammonium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvents are removed by distillation through a 20-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure. A spatula of copper powder is added to the residue, and the stirred mixture is distilled under reduced pressure through a 10-cm Vigreux colum to give 13.5\u201315.5 g (65\u201375%) of Z-1-iodohexene, bp 47\u00b0C/(15 mm) (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

The ice bath is removed, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr, and 0.6 g of solid ammonium chloride is added. Stirring is continued for 30 min, and the salts are then separated by suction filtration through a medium porosity fritted-glass funnel. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure affords 8.18\u20138.63 g of the enol phosphate that is used in Step C without purification (Note 10).\nC. Methyl 2-methyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and an inlet tube connected to a nitrogen source and a mineral oil bubbler (Note 1). The flask is charged with 8.03 g (0.042 mol) of copper(I) iodide (Note 11) and 50 mL of dry diethyl ether (Note 6), flushed with nitrogen, and cooled in an ice bath. The mixture is stirred and cooled as 92.7 mL (0.084 mol) of 1.1 M methyllithium in diethyl ether (Note 12) is added quickly through the septum by means of a syringe. The resulting clear and colorless, or light tan, solution of lithium dimethylcuprate is then cooled in a carbon tetrachloride\u2013dry ice slush bath maintained at \u221223\u00b0C (Note 13). A solution of 8.18\u20138.63 g (ca. 0.028\u20130.030 mol) of the enol phosphate in 35 mL of dry ether is added from the addition funnel over 5\u201310 min. Stirring and cooling are continued for 3 hr, after which time the dark-purple solution is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 75 mL of ice-cold 5% hydrochloric acid saturated with sodium chloride (Note 14). The mixture is stirred, or shaken vigorously, and cooled in an ice bath for 5\u201310 min to complete the hydrolysis. A 150-mL portion of 15% aqueous ammonia is added to the gray suspension and the mixture is swirled vigorously for a few minutes until the organic layer becomes clear and the aqueous layer turns bright blue. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is withdrawn, and the organic phase is washed with 50 mL of 15% aqueous ammonia. The aqueous layers are combined and extracted with one 100-mL portion of ether. The combined ethereal layers are washed with two 50-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Distillation of the remaining 4.25\u20135.47 g of liquid in a short-path distillation apparatus affords 3.99\u20134.17 g (86\u201390% based on \u03b2-keto ester) of methyl 2-methyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate, bp 96\u201397\u00b0C (27 mm) (Note 15),(Note 16),(Note 17)."

The system is evacuated and placed under argon, then 100 mL of ethyl ether (Note 2) is added to the system via cannula. The system is placed in an ice\u2013water bath, and 2 mL of allyl bromide (Note 3) is added via syringe to the magnesium suspension to initiate Grignard formation. The addition funnel is charged with 45.5 g (375 mmol) of allyl bromide and 30 mL of ethyl ether. Another 100 mL of ethyl ether is added to the reaction flask. Stirring is begun, and the allyl bromide\u2013ethyl ether mixture is added dropwise to the cooled reaction flask over a period of about 2 hr. After the addition is complete, the dark-gray solution is stirred for several hours at ambient temperature (Note 4). Meanwhile, a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser with a stopcock, and a 60-mL addition funnel is evacuated and placed under argon. The Grignard solution is transferred, via a cannula, into the flask, and 16.8 g (200 mmol) of cyclopentene oxide (Note 5) is placed in the addition funnel. While the solution is stirred, the epoxide is added dropwise to the Grignard reagent at a rate sufficient to maintain a mild reflux. After the solution is stirred for several hours or overnight, the flask containing the dark gray reaction mixture is placed in an ice\u2013water bath, and excess Grignard reagent is hydrolyzed with 40 mL of a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The fine white precipitate is allowed to settle (Note 6), and the liquid is decanted into a 500-mL separatory funnel. The precipitate is washed with ethyl ether (4 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 7), and all the ethyl ether solutions are combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (3 \u00d7 20 mL), then with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The aqueous layers are combined and washed with ethyl ether (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The ether layers are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate.

Tetrahydrofuran, 500 mL (Note 12), is added to the flask via cannula, and stirring is begun. The substrate and diethyl azodicarboxylate are simultaneously added dropwise, slowly over about 30 min (Note 13), with stirring; the solution turns clear and yellow (Note 14). The reaction is permitted to proceed for 2 days at room temperature; the solution is then transferred to a 1000-mL, one-neck, round-bottomed flask, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, to leave a yellow\u2013white semisolid. A magnetic stirring bar is added to the flask and the semisolid is taken up in 250 mL of reagent-grade methyl alcohol. To this, 10.1 g (316 mmol) of hydrazine (Note 15) is added. A reflux condenser is attached to the flask, stirring is begun, and the system is brought to reflux (Note 16). A large amount of clumpy white solid forms in a yellow-to-orange solution. After 4 hr at reflux, the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature; a mixture of 20 mL of hydrochloric acid (Note 17) and 65 mL of methyl alcohol is added, and the system is refluxed overnight. The resulting reaction mixture is filtered to remove the precipitate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield a white-to-pink solid, which is taken up in 800 mL of water and 28 mL of hydrochloric acid. The solution is filtered, and the solid washed with water (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and hydrochloric acid (20 mL). The liquids are combined, placed in a 2000-mL separatory funnel, and washed with chloroform (3 \u00d7 250 mL), and ethyl ether (1 \u00d7 250 mL). The aqueous layer is transferred to a 2000-mL Erlenmeyer flask and cooled in an ice\u2013water bath. A saturated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is used to make the solution basic, to approximately pH 14, whereupon the solution turns dark olive green. The basic solution is extracted with ethyl ether (10 \u00d7 250 mL or by continuous extraction overnight) and the combined organic layers are dried over a mixture of anhydrous sodium sulfate and anhydrous potassium carbonate. Filtration and solvent removal at atmospheric pressure yields a green\u2013yellow oil. Distillation (52\u201358\u00b0C, 8\u201311 mm) gives 2 (11.8\u201312.5 g, 60\u201363%) as a clear, colorless oil (Note 18).\nC. cis-1-N-Tosyl-2-(2-propenyl)cyclopentylamine.

The system is evacuated and placed under argon. Via cannula, 50 mL of pyridine (Note 19) is added. The flask is cooled in an ice\u2013water bath, the stopcock removed, 12.58 g (66 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 20) is added to the reaction mixture, and the stopcock replaced. The reaction mixture immediately turns orange; it is allowed to stir at 0\u00b0C overnight, during which time the reaction mixture turns deep purple. The reaction mixture is then poured into a separatory funnel, 60 mL of distilled technical grade ethyl acetate is added, and the solution is washed with 100-mL portions of 1 : 1 2 N HCl: saturated aqueous sodium chloride until the washings are acidic. The organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 60 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Gravity filtration and solvent removal under reduced pressure yield a dark red\u2013brown solid. This is purified by recrystallization from 250 mL of ethyl alcohol: water (4 : 1); crystallization is completed in the refrigerator to give 3 (12.7\u201313.9 g, 71\u201378%) as off-white plates, mp 109\u2013110\u00b0C (Note 21).\nD. cis-N-Tosyl-3-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-3-ene.

The yellow\u2013orange solution is heated at reflux until thin-layer chromatography (3 : 1 hexane : ethyl acetate, SiO2) shows that no starting material remains (about 3\u20134 hr); it is then poured into a 500-mL separatory funnel and 100 mL of ethyl acetate is added. This is washed with 100-mL portions of 1 : 1 saturated aqueous sodium chloride : sodium hydroxide (1%) until the aqueous layer is clear; then the yellow\u2013green organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered by gravity, and passed through a short column (approximately 5 cm) of neutral alumina, and the column is washed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined solvents are removed under reduced pressure to give 4.9\u20135.1 g (94\u201399%) of a tan solid. The product is recrystallized from 100 mL of methyl alcohol : water (4 : 1) to yield 4 (3.9\u20134.45 g, 76\u201387%) as white needles, mp 91\u201392\u00b0C (Note 26) and (Note 27)."

            "Caution! Part A should be carried out in an efficient hood, since the reagents are noxious.\nA. 2-(Trimethylsiloxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane. An oven-dried (Note 1) 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an airtight mechanical stirrer (Note 2), a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (Note 3), and a reflux condenser. The top of the condenser is connected to a three-way stopcock with one branch connected to a nitrogen source and the other to a variable pressure oil pump with a dry ice trap (Note 4). The apparatus is flamed dry under a steady stream of nitrogen. The flask is charged with 836 mL (1.07 mol) of a 1.28 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (Note 5). The bulk of the hexane is removed at reduced pressure with stirring until a thick oil is obtained (Note 6). The system is carefully recharged with nitrogen. Alternatively, the use of 107 mL of 10 M butyllithium in hexanes is more convenient and gives similar yields (Note 7). The butyllithium is then cooled in an ice bath and 500 mL of anhydrous ether is added (Note 8), followed by 160 mL of tetramethylethylenediamine (Note 9). The mixture is stirred for a few minutes and 34 mL, 29.14 g (0.404 mol) of 2-methyl-2-propen-1-ol (Note 10) is added dropwise via a syringe over 22 min (Note 11). An immediate, vigorous reaction occurs and the lithium alkoxide precipitates as a white solid. Approximately 350 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 12) is added and the resultant slightly cloudy yellow solution is allowed to warm to room temperature over ca. 4 hr (Note 13). The reaction is stirred for 39 hr (Note 14), at which time the dianion separates as a dark-red gummy material from the deep orange solution. The mixture is cooled to ca. \u221230\u00b0C (Note 15) and 230 mL (1.81 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 16) is added all at once over ca. 20 sec. The reaction turns milky white (Note 17). After 5 min, the dry ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for a further 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture is added in two portions with swirling to 1.5 L of ether in two 2-L conical flasks, after which 1 L of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added very carefully to destroy excess chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 18). The two layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with a further 1.5 L of ether. The combined organic layer is then washed with 1 L of water, two 1-L portions of saturated aqueous copper sulfate solution, and 400 mL of water. The solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and the solvent is removed by atmospheric distillation (Note 19). Careful distillation of the residual oil through a 27-cm Vigreux column at reduced pressure gives a forerun of 4.25 g, bp 29\u201357\u00b0C (4 mm), and 45.8 g (52%) of 2-(trimethylsiloxy)allyltrimethylsilane as a colorless liquid, bp 57\u201359\u00b0C (4 mm) (Note 20).\nB. 2-(Hydroxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane. A 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 21.10 g (0.0975 mol) of 2-(trimethylsiloxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane in 170 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 12) and 44 mL of ca. 1 N aqueous sulfuric acid (Note 21). The resultant two-phase mixture is then stirred vigorously for 1.5 hr at room temperature. Solid anhydrous potassium carbonate is added carefully until bubbling subsides. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove the solvents (Note 19). The remaining liquid is distilled at reduced pressure to give a forerun, 0.4 g, bp 22\u201354\u00b0C (4 mm), and 10.95 g (78%) of 2-(hydroxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane as a colorless liquid, bp 54\u201356\u00b0C (2 mm) (Note 22)."

Like all vinyl monomers, 3-buten-2-one is toxic and the preparation should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood.\nA 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a gas inlet, an externally cooled, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (Note 1), and a gas bubbler is charged with 15% aqueous titanium trichloride (92 mL, 0.109 mol) (Note 2). N,N-Dimethylformamide (Note 3) (70 mL) is added during 45 min with stirring and cooling (ice-bath; 0\u20135\u00b0C) while nitrogen is bubbled through the solution. Freshly distilled 3-buten-2-one (5.7 mL, 0.066 mol) is added at 0\u20135\u00b0C by syringe.

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (Note 1), low-temperature thermometer, and a three-way stopcock having a vertically oriented tube capped with a rubber septum and a horizontal tube connected to a source of dry nitrogen and vacuum, is charged with 10.0 g (37.9 mmol) of 2-(2'-bromo-4',5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethyl chloride (Note 2). The assembled apparatus is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. Freshly distilled diethyl ether (200 mL) (Note 3) is added to the flask by means of a double-ended needle (0.5 m in length) inserted through the vertical tube of the stopcock while a slight vacuum is applied to the apparatus. A slightly positive pressure of nitrogen is then maintained in the apparatus throughout the course of the reaction. The solution is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath (Note 4). The glass jacket (or styrofoam cup) (Note 1), which surrounds the addition funnel, is filled with powdered dry ice, and 33 mL of a 2.3 M solution of tert-butyllithium (76 mmol) in pentane (Note 5) is added to the addition funnel by means of a syringe. After 10 min the lithium reagent is added dropwise to the flask over a period of 1 hr, while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained below \u221260\u00b0C. The solution of the resulting aryllithium reagent 1 is then used in either of the two reactions described below.\nB. 4,5-Methylenedioxybenzocyclobutene. The reaction mixture from Step A is simply allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of several hours, during which time a white precipitate forms. After 18 hr, 100 mL of water is slowly added and the mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. As the mixture is shaken, the solid dissolves in the aqueous phase, which becomes light brown. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are reduced in volume to 150 mL by rotary evaporation, washed with 75 mL of water and then 75 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation to give 5.6 g of pale-yellow solid (Note 6). This crude product is transferred to a large, dry ice-cooled sublimation apparatus (Note 7) and sublimed over a 6-hr period at 35\u00b0C (0.07 mm), at which time a dark-brown oil remains in the bottom of the apparatus. The vacuum is released by filling the apparatus with nitrogen, and the cooled portion of the apparatus is allowed to warm to room temperature. Pure 4,5-methylenedioxybenzocyclobutene, 2 (5.1\u20135.2 g, 91\u201393%) is obtained as colorless crystals, mp 60\u201362\u00b0C (Note 8).\nC. 1-Phenyl-3,4-dihydro-6,7-methylenedioxyisoquinoline. The reaction mixture containing the aryllithium intermediate is stirred for 15 min (internal temperature \u221265 to \u221268\u00b0C), and then 4.3 mL (42 mmol) of distilled benzonitrile is added quickly. The mixture is allowed to warm gradually to room temperature and the stirring is continued overnight. The yellow solution (Note 9) is diluted with 25 mL of ether, the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, and the reaction flask is rinsed with an additional 75 mL of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 150 mL of water and then extracted with three 75-mL portions of 10% (w / w) hydrochloric acid. The combined acid extracts are rendered basic by the addition of 100 mL of 20% (w / w) aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting milky white mixture is extracted with three 75-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation, to give 8.96 g (94% crude yield) of orange-tan solid. This material is purified by recrystallization from ethyl acetate : acetone 2 : 1 (v : v) to give a first crop (6.8 g), and by flash chromatography3 of the residue from the mother liquor, using 150 g of 230\u2013400-mesh silica gel (Merck), a 40-mm diameter column, and elution with 10 : l (v : v) ethyl acetate : methanol. A fast-moving orange band and a slower moving lemon\u2013yellow band can be seen clearly on the column. The lemon-yellow band is collected from the column and evaporation gives a second crop (1.4 g) of comparably pure material. The total yield of the pale-yellow isoquinoline is 8.2 g (86%), mp 135\u2013137\u00b0C (Note 10)."

The mixture is cooled, diluted with 350 mL of pentane, and washed four times with 200-mL portions of cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. The aqueous phases are extracted twice with 100-mL portions of pentane and the combined organic phases are washed rapidly with 100 mL of ice\u2013cold aqueous 2 N HCl and immediately thereafter with a cold saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. After the mixture has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the pentane is removed by rotary evaporation.

        "Procedure": [
            "Caution! The fine lithium dispersion used in this preparation, once washed to remove the mineral oil coating, will ignite spontaneously if exposed to air. Also, the methyl chloride and ether used are very volatile and highly flammable. The entire preparation, including the disposal of any residual lithium, should be performed in an efficient hood with a safety shield in front of the apparatus. A suitable dry-powder fire extinguisher should be kept at hand to extinguish any fires resulting from the accidental spillage of the washed lithium dispersion or of the methyllithium solution.\nA dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a dry ice condenser (Note 1) is flushed with argon (Note2), then capped with a serum stopper, and subsequently maintained under a positive pressure of argon (Note 2). A 30% dispersion of lithium metal (in mineral oil) containing 1% sodium (13.9 g, 2.00 g-atom of lithium) (Note 3) is rapidly weighed and transferred to the flask.\nThe lithium is washed three times by transferring approximately 150-mL portions of anhydrous ethyl ether (Note 4) into the flask through the serum stopper by forced siphon through a stainless-steel cannula, stirring the resulting suspension of lithium briefly, allowing the lithium to rise to the surface, and finally withdrawing the major part of the underlying ether by forced siphon through a cannula. Anhydrous ethyl ether (500 mL) is added to the resultant oil-free lithium. Methyl chloride gas (bp \u221224\u00b0C, d\u221224\u00b0C 0.99 g/mL) from a compressed gas cylinder is passed through a flask containing Linde 4A molecular sieves and into a dry, 100-mL Pyrex graduated cylinder equipped with a 24/40 standard taper joint attached to a Claisen adapter and dry ice condenser, and cooled to \u221224\u00b0C with a bath of dry ice\u2013acetone (Figure 1). When 52.7 mL (52.5 g, 1.04 mol) of liquid methyl chloride has been collected, the adapter and condenser are removed, several boiling chips are added to the cold (\u221224\u00b0C) graduated cylinder, and the cylinder is stoppered with a rubber septum through which is inserted a stainless-steel cannula. The other end of this cannula is inserted through the rubber septum of the flask so that its tip is just above the liquid surface of the reaction flask. Dry ice\u2013acetone is then added to the condenser attached to the reaction flask. Vigorous stirring of the ethereal lithium dispersion is begun and the methyl chloride is added over approximately a 1.5-hr period. The rate at which methyl chlorideis distilled into the reaction vessel is controlled by slight cooling or warming of the graduated cylinder that contains the liquid methyl chloride. During addition, the initial grey suspension changes to a brown to purple suspension; by the end of the addition, little, if any, lithium metal should be seen floating on the surface of the ether solution when stirring is interrupted. After the addition of methyl chloride is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C for an additional 0.5\u20131 hr and then allowed to stand overnight or longer (Note 5) at 25\u00b0C under a static argon atmosphere, whereupon the precipitated lithium chloride settles to the bottom of the flask. The dry ice condenser and thermometer are removed from the flask and replaced with rubber septa. The supernatant methyllithium solution is transferred by forced siphon using a large-gauge cannula through a glass wool pad (Note 6) into a receiving flask previously flushed with an inert gas (Figure 2). The receiving flask, which contains the filtrate, a pale-yellow solution of methyllithium, is removed (Note 7) and stored in a refrigerator for 12\u201324 hr during, which time an additional small quantity of lithium chloride separates as fine crystals. The resulting supernatant solution is transferred with a stainless-steel cannula and a slight positive pressure of argon or nitrogen into one or more suitable oven-dried, nitrogen-filled storage bottles capped with rubber septa. Two 1-mL aliquots of the solution are removed with a hypodermic syringe for a modified Gilman titration (Note 8) and a 5-mL aliquot is removed with a hypodermic syringe to determine the halide concentration (Note 9). The solution contains 1.40\u20131.77 M methyllithium accompanied by 0.07\u20130.09 M lithium chloride corresponding to a 70\u201389% yield of methyllithium. If this solution is protected from oxygen and moisture, it may be stored at 0\u201325\u00b0C for several months (and remain active).\nFigure 1. Condensing the methyl chloride.\nFigure 2.

            "A. 2,2-Dimethyl-4-pentenal. In a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask that contains a magnetic stirring bar are placed 108 g (1.5 mol) of isobutyraldehyde (Note 1), 58 g (1.0 mol) of allyl alcohol (Note 1), 230 mL of p-cymene (Note 1), and 0.4 g (2 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 1). The mixture is heated with a mantle with stirring for 32 hr under a 50-cm fractionating column packed with 6-mm glass beads and topped by a Dean-Stark trap. The reaction mixture is then distilled through the packed column. The fraction that boils at 120\u2013126\u00b0C is collected. The yield is 86.0\u201387.3 g (77\u201378%) of 2,2-dimethyl-4-pentenal (1) as a clear, colorless oil, nD25 1.4216 (Note 2).\nB. 4,4-Dimethyl-1,6-heptadien-3-ol. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with mechanical stirrer, 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and condenser topped with a gas inlet for maintaining an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, is placed 17 g (0.7 g-atom) of magnesium turnings (Note 3). The system is flushed with nitrogen, and methanol maintained at \u221220\u00b0C is circulated through the condenser (Note 4). From a solution of 70 g (0.65 mol) of vinyl bromide (Note 5) in 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 6), a 50-mL quantity is added by means of the addition funnel, and the resulting mixture is stirred mechanically. After a few minutes an exothermic reaction ensues, which subsides after several minutes of vigorous boiling (Note 7). The remainder of the vinyl bromide solution is added at such a rate as to maintain a gentle reflux. After stirring at room temperature for 12 hr, the resulting mixture is cooled with an ice\u2013water bath, and 62 g (0.55 mol) of 2,2-dimethyl-4-pentenal (1) is added dropwise over 25\u201330 min through the addition funnel, which is then rinsed with 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 23\u00b0C and then poured into a mixture of 1 kg of ice, 200 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 400 mL of water. The resulting mixture is extracted with three 500-mL portions of ether. The combined extracts are washed successively with 400 mL of water, 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the product through a 15-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column gives 63.4\u201363.8 g (82\u201383% yield) of 4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadien-3-ol (2), bp 76\u201379\u00b0C (20 mm), n24D 1.4562 (Note 8).\nC. 3,3-Dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-ol. A 25-mL test tube is charged with 0.3\u20130.4 g (0.6\u20130.8 mmol) of bis(copper trifluoromethanesulfonate)benzene complex (Note 9) and sealed with a rubber septum under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. A solution of 5 mL (4.3 g, 0.031 mol) of 4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadien-3-ol in 10 mL of ether (Note 10) is added by means of a syringe. The resulting solution is poured (Note 11) into a nitrogen-flushed Pyrex 250-mL annular reactor fitted with a magnetic stirrer, an internal concentric water-jacketed quartz immersion well, and a water-cooled reflux condenser topped with a gas inlet for maintaining an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. An additional 20 mL (17.4 g, 0.124 mol) of the hydroxydiene 2 in 200 mL of dry ether is added. The resulting solution is stirred and irradiated for 15 hr with a 450-W medium-pressure Hanovia mercury are (Note 12) that is suspended in the immersion well. At the end of that time an opaque film of copper is wiped from the immersion well, and irradiation is then continued for an additional 7 hr. The resulting solution is shaken in a separatory funnel with a mixture of 100 g of ice and 100 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The organic phases are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation using a rotary evaporator and the product is distilled through a 15-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give 19.0\u201319.9 g (88\u201392% yield) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-ol (3), bp 80\u201384\u00b0C (12 mm), nD25 1.4761\u20131.4783 (Note 13).\nD. 3,3-Dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-one. In a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is placed 35.1 g (0.25 mol) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-2-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanol and 200 mL of acetone (Note 14). The solution is cooled with an ice-water bath while 100 mL of 2.7 M Jones reagent (Note 15) is added in small portions over 15 min with vigorous stirring (Note 16). The ice\u2013water bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at 5\u201320\u00b0C for 2 hr. Then 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted with three 500-mL portions of ether. The extractions are combined and washed successively with 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The solvent is removed by means of a rotary evaporator, and the resulting product is transferred to a separatory funnel and separated from the water. The aqueous layer is extracted with 50 mL of ether. The product and the ether layer are combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation using a rotary evaporator and the product is distilled through a 15-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give 28.7\u201332.2 g (83\u201393% yield) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-one (4), bp 72\u201375\u00b0C (12 mm), nD20 1.4622 (Note 17)."

The mixture is heated while it is stirred in a water bath to 80\u201390\u00b0C for 4 hr, during which time a thick yellow precipitate of N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)pyridinium chloride is formed (Note 3). After cooling to 0\u00b0C a solution of 100.0 g (2.22 mol) of dimethylamine in 300 mL of dry pyridine was prechilled to 0\u00b0C and added dropwise over a period of about 30 min with stirring. The resulting brownish-red liquid reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for 12 hr. The drying tube is replaced by a gas inlet and the system is flushed with dry nitrogen in a hood. Under nitrogen, 70.0 g (1.06 mol) of ice-cold, freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (Note 4) is added, and subsequently 400 mL of 2.5 M sodium methoxide solution (Note 5) is slowly added dropwise to the stirred reaction mixture. During addition of the sodium methoxide, the temperature rises to 35\u201340\u00b0C. After the addition is completed, stirring is continued for another 4 hr. The reaction vessel is immersed in an oil bath, the dropping funnel removed, and the flask is fitted with a distillation head. The stirred mixture is cautiously heated under nitrogen (Note 6), and a mixture of pyridine and methanol is distilled off until the temperature of the reaction mixture has increased to 105\u2013110\u00b0C (Note 7). After the distillation head is removed and 1 L of dry pyridine added, the black mixture is heated with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 days with a bath temperature of 125\u00b0C. It is then cooled to 60\u00b0C, the reflux condenser is replaced by a distillation head, and pyridine is removed under reduced pressure (Note 8). The gummy black solid residue is removed by a spatula and rinsed with hexanes. It is extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with 1.5 L of hexanes in several batches. To remove the remaining pyridine, the combined blue hexane rinse and the extraction solutions are carefully washed with two 150-L portions of 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid, then water (Note 9). The organic layer is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is distilled through a 50-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The crude azulene is purified by chromatography on activity II alumina (Note 10) with hexane and yields azulene as blue plates, mp 96\u201397\u00b0C, yield 65\u201375 g (51\u201359%) (Note 11)."

The mixture is stirred and the flask is heated in an oil bath maintained at 125\u2013130\u00b0C. Ethanol begins to distill off when the internal temperature reaches 95\u2013100\u00b0C.

The combined crops are dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0C to give 320\u2013339 g (74\u201378%) of white crystals, mp 86\u201388\u00b0C [lit.2 mp 87\u201389\u00b0C] (Note 4).\nB. 3-Acetyl-2-oxazolidinone. A 3-L, one-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 326 g (3.75 mol) of 2-oxazolidinone, 94 g (1.15 mol) of anhydrous sodium acetate, and 1.6 L of acetic anhydride. The stirred solution is refluxed for 3 hr and the acetic anhydride is then removed by distillation at 15\u201320 mm. The residue is extracted with three 875\u2013mL portions of boiling toluene (Note 5), and the hot toluene extractions are filtered, combined, and concentrated to a total volume of 675 mL. Diethyl ether (675 mL) is added with stirring to the toluene solution and the mixture is chilled in an ice\u2013water bath. The precipitate is removed by filtration and washed with 250 mL of diethyl ether to give 328\u2013403 g (68\u201383%) of colorless to very light tan crystals, mp 65\u201367\u00b0C [lit.2 mp 69\u201370\u00b0C] (Note 6). A second crop of 63\u201324 g (13\u20135%), mp 65\u201368\u00b0C, is obtained by concentrating the filtrate to 275 mL and chilling it in an ice\u2013water bath.\nC. 3-Acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinone. A 3-L, four-necked flask is equipped with a reflux condenser topped with a gas discharge tube, thermometer, fritted-glass inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask, and a glass sleeve for accepting an ultraviolet (UV) lamp (Note 7). The reaction vessel is charged with 258 g (2.0 mol) of 3-acetyl-2-oxazolidinone, 2 L of carbon tetrachloride, and several boiling chips. The mixture is heated to gentle reflux, the light source is turned on, and 155 g (2.18 mol) of chlorine gas (Note 8) is introduced at such a rate that no chlorine escapes from the condenser (Note 9). After the addition is complete, heating is discontinued and nitrogen is bubbled through the reaction mixture to remove the dissolved hydrogen chloride. The solvent is then removed on a rotary evaporator to give a yellow oil, which consists of a mixture of 3-acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinones3 and is used in Step D without further purification.\nD. 3-Acetyl-2(3H)-oxazolone. The crude mixture of 3-acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinone from Step C is placed in a 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, sealed mechanical stirrer, and gas discharge tube. The material is heated to 120\u00b0C with stirring, and the temperature is then slowly increased to 150\u00b0C and held there until the evolution of gas ceases (Note 10). The cooled, black reaction mixture is distilled at 20 mm. The fractions boiling up to 150\u00b0C are collected and redistilled through a 50-cm \u00d7 3-cm Vigreux column fitted with a variable take-off head. There is obtained 140\u2013172 g (55\u201368%) of product, bp 108\u2013112\u00b0C (24 mm), which solidifies, mp 35\u201337\u00b0C (Note 11).\nE. 4-Acetyl-7,8-dimethyl-2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.3.0]non-7-en-3-one. A solution of 63.5 g (0.5 mol) of 3-acetyl-2(3H)-oxazolone, 27.5 g (0.33 mol) of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene (Note 12), and 2.0 g of hydroquinone in 125 mL of benzene is heated at 160\u00b0C under nitrogen in a 360-ml Hastelloy C shaker tube (Note 13). After 12 hr, the pressure vessel is cooled to room temperature, recharged with 27.5 g of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, and heated another 12 hr at 160\u00b0C. The vessel is again cooled, recharged with 27.5 g of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, and heated at 160\u00b0C for a final 12 hr. The resulting mixture is distilled to give 36.4\u201340.3 g (35\u201339%) of crude product, bp 115\u2013130\u00b0C (0.5 mm), which solidifies (Note 14) and (Note 15). This material can be recrystallized by adding 36.4 g of melted product to 50 mL of boiling hexane, followed by cooling to give 27.6 g (26%) of crystals, mp 72\u201378\u00b0C (Note 16).\nF. 6-Amino-3,4-dimethyl-cis-3-cyclohexen-1-ol. A solution of 26.1 g (0.125 mol) of 4-acetyl-7,8-dimethyl-2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.3.0]non-7-en-3-one and 42.0 g (0.75 mol) of potassium hydroxide in 200 mL of methanol and 100 mL of water is refluxed for 36 hr. The resulting mixture is exhaustively extracted with diethyl ether using a liquid\u2013liquid continuous extraction apparatus. The ethereal extract is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the residue is taken up in 150 mL of methylene chloride. The resulting solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to dryness. The solid residue (16.5 g) is recrystallized from 100 mL of diethyl ether to give 11.2 g (64%) of colorless crystals, mp 63\u201365.5\u00b0C. A second crop of 2.3 g (13%) is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor to 50 mL and chilling in an ice\u2013water bath (Note 17)."

The flask is charged with 300 mL of dichloromethane (Note 1) and 34.8 g (0.10 mol) of ethyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (Note 2) and flushed with nitrogen. The yellow solution is stirred at 25\u00b0C as a solution of 10.1 g (0.10 mol) of triethylamine (Note 3) in 100 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise over 5 min. After 10 min, 9.25 g (0.10 mol) of propionyl chloride (Note 4) in 100 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the vigorously stirred solution over 15 min (Note 5). Stirring is continued for an additional 0.5 hr (Note 6), after which the clear, yellow-tinted mixture is evaporated on a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure using a water bath maintained at 25\u00b0C (Note 7). A 500-mL portion of pentane (Note 8) is added to the semisolid residue, and the slurry is allowed to stand for 2 hr while it is shaken periodically to facilitate solidification and to complete the extraction of the product. The precipitate is removed by filtration through a coarse, sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filter cake is washed with a 50-mL portion of pentane. The filtrates are combined and concentrated at reduced pressure to approximately one-fourth of the original volume using a water bath maintained at 25\u00b0C.

The pH of a solution of tungstic acid (WO3 \u00b7 H2O) (1.1 g, 0.044 mol) (Note 1) in 280 mL of distilled water is adjusted to 11.5 by addition of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide; the white suspension of the tungstate catalyst is added to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The tungstic acid\u2013water mixture is cooled to 0\u201310\u00b0C by means of an ice\u2013salt bath; glacial acetic acid (50 mL) and trimethylene sulfide (thietane) (47.5 g, 0.641 mol, d 1.028) (Note 2) are added. The chilled mixture is stirred, and 30% hydrogen peroxide (189 mL) is added carefully by means of the addition funnel over a period of 2 hr (Note 3). The mixture is stirred at 0\u201310\u00b0C for an additional hour, transferred to an evaporating dish, and heated to near dryness on a steam bath. The resulting solid material is triturated five times with 100-mL portions of hot chloroform; any catalyst is removed by filtration. The chloroform solutions are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent is removed via a rotary evaporator to give a white solid (60.3\u201363.7 g, 0.57\u20130.60 mol, 88.7\u201393.7%), mp 74\u201376\u00b0C (lit.2 mp 75.5\u201376\u00b0C).\nB. 3-Chlorothietane 1,1-dioxide. Thietane 1,1-dioxide (14.0 g, 0.132 mol) is placed in a three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser and a chlorine bubbler. Caution! (Since chlorine is poisonous, the reaction involving it should be done in a good hood.) Carbon tetrachloride (300 mL) is added to the flask (Note 4) and the suspension is irradiated by a 250-W sunlamp positioned as close as possible to the reaction flask without touching it (Note 5) while chlorine is bubbled through the solution for 15 min at a moderate rate (Note 6). A copious white precipitate forms and irradiation and addition of chlorine must be stopped at this point (or 10 min after the first appearance of a precipitate) to avoid dichlorination. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered to give a white, fluffy product (5.4\u20138.1 g, 30\u201344%) that is crystallized from chloroform, mp 136\u2013137\u00b0C (lit.3 mp 136.5\u2013137.5\u00b0C).\nC.

The reaction is heated to 60\u00b0C and triethylamine (28.7 g, 0.28 mol, 39.5 mL) is added through the condenser. The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hr and triethylamine hydrochloride is removed by filtration and washed with toluene (100 mL). Toluene is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue is recrystallized from diethyl ether\u2013ethanol (Note 8) to give a white solid (4.5\u20134.8 g, 75\u201381%); mp 49\u201350\u00b0C (lit.3 mp 52\u201354\u00b0C).\nD. 3,3-Dichlorothietane 1,1-dioxide. Thietane 1,1-dioxide (5.0 g, 0.047 mol) is placed in a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, magnetic stirrer, and chlorine gas bubbler. Carbon tetrachloride (350 mL) is added and the solution is irradiated with a 250-W sunlamp (Note 5) while chlorine is bubbled through the stirred mixture for 1 hr (Note 9). Irradiation and chlorine addition are stopped and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The product is collected by filtration as a white solid (4.0\u20134.4 g, 49\u201353%), mp 156\u2013158\u00b0C4 (Note 10). the product can be used without further purification or recrystallized from chloroform.\nE. 3-Chlorothiete 1,1-dioxide. A solution of 3,3-dichlorothietane 1,1-dioxide (4.0 g, 0.023 mol) in toluene (150 mL) is placed in a 250-mL, round-bottomed, two-necked flask equipped with a heating mantle (or silicone oil bath), magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer. The solution is heated to 60\u00b0C and triethylamine (2.54 g, 0.025 mol, 3.5 mL) is added dropwise through the condenser over a 10-min period. The solution is stirred for 2 hr at 60\u00b0C and cooled to room temperature. The triethylamine hydrochloride is collected by filtration and washed with hot toluene (50 mL). Removal of toluene on a rotary evaporator gives a white solid (2.7\u20133.0 g, 84\u201393%) that is recrystallized from chloroform-hexane, mp 118\u2013120\u00b0C4 (Note 11)."

The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at about 30\u00b0C, 20.0 g (0.154 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate (Note 3) is added, and the fermenting suspension (Note 4) is stirred for another 24 hr at room temperature. A warm (ca. 40\u00b0C) solution of 200 g of sucrose (Note 1) in 1 L of tap water is then added, followed 1 hr later by an additional 20.0 g (0.154 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate (Note 3). Stirring is continued for 50\u201360 hr at room temperature. When the reaction is complete by gas chromatographic analysis (Note 5), the mixture is worked up by first adding 80 g of Celite and filtering through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 4, 17-cm diam). After the filtrate is washed with 200 mL of water, it is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with five 500-mL portions of ethyl ether (Note 6). The combined ether extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 35\u00b0C bath temperature to a volume of 50\u201380 mL. This residue is fractionally distilled at a pressure of 12 mm through a 10-cm Vigreux column, and the fraction boiling at 71\u201373\u00b0C (12 mm) is collected to give 24\u201331 g (59\u201376%) of (S)-( + )-ethyl 3-hydroxybutanoate (Note 7) and (Note 8); the specific rotation [\u03b1]25D + 37.2\u00b0 (chloroform, c 1.3) corresponds to an enantiomeric excess of 85% (Note 9).\nThe enantiomeric excess may be enhanced by several crystallizations of the 3,5-dinitrobenzoate derivative (Note 10) or else by using \"starved\" yeast (Note 11)."

In the buffer solution thus obtained are dissolved 2.00 g (13.87 mmol) of cis-1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane (Note 2), 0.58 g (0.852 mmol) of \u03b2-NAD (Note 3), and 7.8 g (16.2 mmol) of FMN (Note 4). To the clear orange solution obtained is added 80 units of horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Note 5). After the solution is gently swirled for 1 min, the pH is readjusted to 9 and the mixture is kept at room temperature (Note 6) with the mouth of the flask loosely covered by a watchglass. After a few minutes the color of the solution begins to darken and after several hours becomes an opaque green-brown. The pH is readjusted to 9 after 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr by the careful addition of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide since the pH of the mixture drops progressively as the reaction proceeds. After 4 days (Note 7), the mixture is brought to a pH of ca. 13.3 by the addition of 20 mL of aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide solution.

The sealed flask is charged by cannula, under argon, with 150 mL of degassed benzene (Note 5) and stirred under argon for 15 min at room temperature. The catalyst is transferred by cannula, under argon, into the autoclave (see below).\nB. Asymmetric hydrogenation. A stainless steel stirred autoclave with a total volume of 500 mL is charged with 25.6 g (0.2 mol) of ketopantoyl lactone (Note 6),(Note 7),(Note 8),(Note 9). The autoclave is flushed with argon and the catalyst solution (see above) is added by cannula, under argon. The autoclave is sealed and hydrogenation is carried out at 40\u00b0C, 750-psig hydrogen and 950\u20131050 rpm for 48 hr (Note 10). Care should be taken to flush all the lines before connecting to the autoclave. After the autoclave is cooled to room temperature, it is vented and opened.

The system is shielded from light with aluminum foil and placed under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is placed in an oil bath and the temperature is raised to 70\u00b0C. The reaction is monitored by gas chromatography (GLC, (Note 3)) until complete (1\u20132 hr). The mixture is cooled, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with 500 mL and then two 100-ml portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed with 500 and 100 mL of saturated brine. The combined brine wash is extracted with a further two 100-mL portions of dichloromethane.

The system is shielded from light with aluminum foil and the contents of the flask are stirred in a 15\u201316\u00b0C bath (Note 9) for 1.0 hr. To the resultant suspension is added 45.5 g (0.25 mol) of the 2-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)-1,3-cyclopentanedione prepared in Step A. A total of 62.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide is used to ensure complete transfer. The degassing procedure is repeated four times and stirring at 15\u201316\u00b0C (Note 10) is continued for 40\u2013120 (Note 11) as the mixture becomes yellow and then brown.

A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser capped with an argon-inlet tube is charged with 126.1 g (1 mol) of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (Note 1) and 300 mL of distilled water. To the well-stirred suspension are added 3 mL of acetic acid, 1.1 g of hydroquinone, and 142 g (167 mL, 2 mol) of freshly distilled methyl vinyl ketone (Note 2). The reaction mixture is stirred under argon at 72\u201375\u00b0C for 1 hr, cooled to room temperature, treated with sodium chloride (103 g), and poured into a separatory funnel containing ethyl acetate (400 mL). The organic phase is collected and the aqueous phase is reextracted twice with ethyl acetate (150 mL each time). The combined extracts are washed with two 200-mL portions of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered, and the filtrate is evaporated at 40\u00b0C under reduced pressure (water aspirator) on a rotary evaporator. The residue is kept under high vacuum (1.0 mm) at 40\u00b0C for 30 min to give 210.8 g of crude 2-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (1, \"trione\") as a pale-yellow oil, homogeneous by thin-layer chromatography (Note 3). This crude material is used in Step B.\nB. (S)-8a-Methyl-3,4,8,8a-tetrahydro-1,6(2H, 7H)-naphthalenedione (3-S). A 3-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an argon-inlet tube and containing a magnetic stirrer, is charged with 5.75 g (0.05 mol) of finely ground L-proline (Note 4) and a solution of 210.8 g of crude trione 1 (from Step A) in 1 L of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 5). The mixture is stirred at room temperature (ca. 25\u00b0C) under argon for 120 hr, the magnetic bar is removed, and the solvent is removed under high vacuum (1.0 mm) at 65\u00b0C (Note 6) on a rotary evaporator to give 206.9 g of a dark reddish-violet oil. The oil is dissolved in toluene (100 mL) and is absorbed on a column (9 cm X 60 cm) of silica gel (1.5 kg, 70\u2013230 mesh) (Note 7), which was previously packed in hexane. Elution is carried out under a slight positive pressure of argon (ca. 1 atm) (Note 8) initially with 1 L of hexane: ethyl acetate (5 : 1) and then with a 3 : 2 mixture of hexane : ethyl acetate taking 300-mL fractions. The progress of the purification is monitored by thin-layer chromatography (Note 9): no product is observed until ca. 5 L of eluant is collected. Fractions containing the product are combined, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator) at 45\u201350\u00b0C. The residue is then kept under high vacuum (0.1 mm) at 40\u00b0C for 30 min to give 154.2 g of an orange-colored oil, which became glassy and sometimes crystalline on standing at room temperature, [\u03b1]D25 + 68\u00b0 (toluene, c 1.5) (Note 10). This material is dissolved in 535 mL of ether and is filtered through a fluted filter paper to remove small particles.

After cooling to 3\u00b0C, the combined filtrates are seeded with a few crystals of pure 3-S (Note 11), and the mixture is left undisturbed at \u221220\u00b0C for 18 hr. Most of the supernatant liquid is carefully decanted without agitation, and the crystals are collected by filtration. The flask is rinsed with cold (0\u00b0C) 50% ether in hexane and the rinse is used to wash the crystals.

The mixture is left at \u221220\u00b0C for 18 hr, and the supernatant liquid is carefully decanted (no agitation). The wet crystals are then collected by filtration, washed with cold (0\u00b0C) 50% ether in hexane, and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature to give 36.3 g of racemic material (3R + 3S). The filtrate and washing are evaporated to give 30.6 g of an oil, which is dissolved in 100 mL of ether, and filtered through a fluted filter paper. The flask is rinsed with 114 mL of ether, and filtered through the fluted filter paper, and the combined filtrates are cooled to 3\u00b0C and seeded with crystals of the pure 3-S.

            "Caution! Methyl bromoacetate, used in Step B, is intensely irritating to eyes and skin. The preparation of the ester should be carried out in an efficient hood.\nA. Pyrolysis of dicyclopentadiene to form cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene is prepared from its dimeric form by distillation according to the method of Moffett.2 The apparatus for the distillation is assembled as shown in Figure 1. The equipment consists of a 250-mL flask, a Friedrichs condenser fitted with a Haake Model FE hot water circulator, a Claisen head, a thermometer, a gas inlet tube, and a collection receiver that is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath.\nFigure 1. Apparatus for producing cyclopentadiene.\nIn the 250-mL flask is placed 100 mL of dicyclopentadiene (Note 1). The material is heated at reflux (bath temperature 200\u2013210\u00b0C) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 2). After a 5-mL forerun is collected and discarded, the collection receiver is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and 25 mL (0.30 mol) of cyclopentadiene is rapidly distilled at bp 36\u201342\u00b0C. A slight positive pressure of nitrogen is maintained throughout the distillation to prevent moisture from entering the system.\nThe distilled cyclopentadiene is stored at \u221278\u00b0C until it is used (Note 3). Residual dicyclopentadiene can be reused until it solidifies on cooling.\nB. Preparation in situ of methyl 2,4-cyclopentadiene-1-acetate (Note 4). Cyclopentadienylsodium is prepared by modification of the methods of King3 and Hafner4 (Note 5).\nIn a 500-mL, three-necked Morton flask fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, and gas inlet tube is placed 8.6 g (0.375 g-atom) of sodium and 75 mL of dry xylene (Note 6); the unstirred mixture is heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the xylene has reached its boiling point and the sodium has melted, the solution is rapidly stirred to produce a very fine-grained sodium sand. Quickly the heating mantle is removed and stirring stopped (Note 7). After cooling, the xylene is pipetted or siphoned away from the sodium sand and stored for future use.\nThe sand is washed with 3 \u00d7 25 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 8) and then is layered with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture is cooled to \u221210\u00b0C (Note 9) under a nitrogen atmosphere. A solution of 25 mL (0.30 mol) of cyclopentadiene in 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise using a dropping funnel. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, by which time hydrogen evolution has ceased. In the absence of air, the solution ranges from near colorless to bright pink (Note 10).\nIn a 1-L, three-necked flask fitted with a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed 45.9 g (0.30 mol) of methyl bromoacetate (Note 11) and 75 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in an inert atmosphere.\nThe solution of ca. 0.30 mol of cyclopentadienylsodium is decanted from residual sodium sand with a U-tube into the dropping funnel (Note 12) and is added dropwise over a 2-hr period (Note 13). A white precipitate of sodium bromide forms during the addition. The heterogeneous solution is stirred overnight at \u221278\u00b0C to ensure complete formation of methyl 2,4-cyclopentadiene-1-acetate.\nC. Asymmetric hydroboration with ( + )-di-3-pinanylborane to form methyl (1R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-acetate (Note 4). The ( + )-di-3-pinanylborane is prepared from ( \u2212 )-\u03b1-pinene by a modification5,6 of the method of Brown7 (Note 14).\nIn a 2-L, three-necked flask fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed 90.0 g (0.66 mol) of ( \u2212 )-\u03b1-pinene (Note 15). The flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C and under an inert atmosphere a total of 300 mL (0.30 mol) of 1 M borane in tetrahydrofuran (Note 16) is added dropwise over a 1-hr period. The solution is stirred for 18 hr at 0\u00b0C, during which time a white precipitate of ( + )-di-3-pinanylborane forms. This solution is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. The ca. 0.30 mol solution of methyl 2,4-cyclo-pentadiene-1-acetate (Section B) is transferred at \u221278\u00b0C to a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel through a U-tube in an inert atmosphere and is added rapidly, in one portion, to the stirring solution of di-3-pinanylborane at \u221278\u00b0C. After this mixture is stirred for 6 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, the bath temperature is allowed to rise to 0\u00b0C and the mixture is stirred for 16 hr at 0\u00b0C to complete the hydroboration reaction.\nTo the reaction mixture is added dropwise 90 mL of 3 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by 90 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Note 17). The mixture is stirred for 30 min to complete the oxidation process. A total of 3 g of sodium bisulfite, 5 g of sodium chloride, and 125 mL of ether are added and the mixture is stirred for 10 min (Note 18). On standing, the reaction mixture separates into two layers, which are separated with a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with brine (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The water layer and the brine washes are combined and extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 125 mL). All the organic layers are then combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of solvent under reduced pressure yield 110 g of a pale-yellow oil containing the desired product as well as ( + )-isopinocampheol, and ( \u2212 )-\u03b1-pinene (Note 19). The product mixture is dissolved in 250 mL of ether and is extracted with 1 M aqueous silver nitrate solution (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The aqueous layers are combined and back-extracted once with 50 mL of ether. The ether layers containing ( + )-isopinocampheol are discarded.\nThe aqueous layers containing the silver(I) complex of methyl (1R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-acetate are then treated with an excess of saturated brine to precipitate silver chloride and free the desired product. After precipitation is complete, the water layer is decanted from the solid silver chloride. The solids are washed with ether (4 \u00d7 100 mL) and each ether layer is used to extract the water layer (Note 20). The combined ether layers are washed with 50 mL of brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of solvent under reduced pressure yield 16\u201319 g of crude product. The product is distilled through a 4-in.-Vigreux column at 0.1 mm pressure to yield 12.8\u201314.7 g (27\u201331%) of methyl (1R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-acetate, bp 74\u201378\u00b0C at 0.1 mm, [\u03b1]D25 \u2212132\u00b0 (CH3OH, c 1.06) (Note 21) and (Note 22)."

            "A. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum-capped sidearm, magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, and stopcock adapter connected to a mercury bubbler is flame-dried while being flushed with nitrogen. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained during the procedure through the oxidation step. After the apparatus is cooled, it is charged, via a double-ended needle,2 with 800 mL of a 0.5 M tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN, 0.4 mol, (Note 1)). Then 61.3 g (71.5 mL, 0.45 mol) of ( + )-\u03b1-pinene (Note 2) is added. After the solution is refluxed for 4 hr, the excess \u03b1-pinene and THF are removed by vacuum (Note 3) to provide a thick clear oil of neat B-3-pinanyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, 1 (Note 4).\nB. The flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C (ice bath) and 35.3 g (0.285 mol) of 1-octyn-3-one (Note 5) is added. After an initially exothermic reaction, the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature. The reduction can be monitored by gas chromatography (Note 6), but generally 8 hr is required for completion. The color of the reaction mixture is initially light yellow and darkens to red at the end of the reduction.\nC. Excess 1 is destroyed by adding 22 mL (0.3 mol) of freshly distilled propionaldehyde and stirring for 1 hr at room temperature. Liberated \u03b1-pinene is then removed by vacuum (Note 7). Tetrahydrofuran, 200 mL, is added, followed by 150 mL of 3 M aqueous NaOH. Hydrogen peroxide (150 mL, 30%) is added dropwise (see Caution in (Note 8)). Oxidation is complete in 3 hr at 40\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with three 50-mL portions of ethyl ether. The ether layers are combined and dried with copious amounts of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to give an oil. Distillation at 60\u201365\u00b0C (3.0 mm) yields 31 g (0.245 mol) of 1-octyn-3-ol, 86% yield (Note 9). The distillation pot residue is a thick oil consisting for the most part of cis-1,5-cyclooctanediol. An NMR lanthanide shift study showed the alcohol to be 93% (R) and 7% (S), 86% e.e.

        "Procedure": [
            "A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer with Teflon blades, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 1.00 L of methylene chloride (Note 1) and 39.9 mL (38.1 g, 0.134 mol) of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Note 2). The flask content is stirred and cooled under nitrogen in a dry ice\u2013ethanol bath to \u221270\u00b0C. To the flask is then added 33.1 g (27.5 mL, 0.161 mol) of diethyl (2R,3R)-tartrate (Note 3) and 25.0 g (0.25 mol) of E-2-hexen-1-ol (Note 4). A small volume of methylene chloride is used to ensure complete transfer of each material to the reaction flask. To the flask is then added 184.5 mL (0.50 mol) of 2.71 M anhydrous tert-butyl hydroperoxide in toluene (Note 5) that has been precooled to \u221220\u00b0C (Note 6). The addition causes a temperature increase to \u221260\u00b0C; the temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to come to 0\u00b0C over a 2.0-hr period (Note 7).\nA 4-L beaker equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and thermometer is charged with a solution of 125 g of ferrous sulfate and 50 g of tartaric acid in a total volume of 500 mL of deionized water. The solution is stirred and cooled by means of an ice\u2013water bath to 10\u00b0C. When the epoxidation reaction mixture reaches 0\u00b0C, it is immediately (Note 8) poured into the stirred contents of the beaker. The resulting reaction is mildly exothermic, causing a temperature rise to ca. 20\u00b0C (Note 9). After the exothermic reaction has subsided and the temperature has begun to drop (ca. 5 min), the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min. The contents of the beaker are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 250-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 35\u00b0C (70 mm) to give 85.9\u201389.9 g (Note 10) of pale-amber oil.\nA 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer with Teflon blades is charged with a solution of the reaction product in 750 mL of ether. The contents of the flask are cooled in an ice\u2013water bath to 3\u00b0C. To the flask is added a precooled (3\u00b0C) solution of 20 g (0.50 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 500 mL of brine (Note 11). The two-phase mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hr with continued cooling (Note 12) and then is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 150-mL portions of ether (Note 13) and (Note 14). The combined organic solution (Note 15) is dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Solvent removal with a rotary evaporator at 35\u00b0C (70 mm) followed by concentration with the rotary evaporator at 35\u00b0C (12 mm) for 1.0 hr gives 24.7\u201325.0 g of crude (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a pale-amber oil (Note 16).\nThe crude product is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column (the receiving flask is cooled in an ice\u2013water bath) to yield 22.45\u201322.84 g (80\u201381%) of (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a colorless liquid, bp 31\u201333\u00b0C (0.30\u20130.40 mm). Analysis by GC indicates a chemical purity of 89\u201393% (Note 17). The material is fractionally distilled through a 20-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to obtain 17.69\u201319.44 g (63\u201369%), [\u03b1]D22 \u221238.1 to \u221238.6\u00b0 (neat), [\u03b1]D23 \u221246.2 to \u221248.6\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 1.0) of a colorless liquid. Analysis by GC indicates a chemical purity of 96\u201398% (Note 17). An enantiomeric purity of 96.4\u201397.5% is determined by 1H NMR analysis of the derived acetate using Eu(hfc)3, tris[3-(heptafluoropropylhydroxymethylene)-d-camphorato] europium(III), (Note 18) as the chiral shift reagent (Note 19). The enantiomeric purity may also be determined by GC analysis (Note 20) of the derived \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid esters3 (Note 21) and (Note 22). An alternative to the distillation method is purification by preparative HPLC (Note 23) and (Note 24) and bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 25) to give 21.85 g (78%) of (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a white solid, mp 19\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 \u221246.6\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 1.0). Analysis by GC of material purified in this manner indicates a chemical purity of >99% (Note 14) and an enantiomeric purity of 96.8% (Note 20),(Note 21),(Note 22)."

            "A. 2-Hydroxybutanenitrile. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer and charged with 312 g (3.0 mol) of sodium bisulfite and 1050 mL of water. The stirrer is started and after the sodium bisulfite has dissolved, the flask is placed in an ice\u2013salt bath. A solution of 147 g (3.0 mol) of sodium cyanide (Note 1) in 450 mL of water and 174 g (3.0 mol) of propanal (Note 2) are separately cooled to 0\u00b0C in ice\u2013salt baths. When the temperature of the vigorously stirring sodium bisulfite solution has stabilized at 0\u00b0C the cold propanal is added in one portion. The temperature of the reaction solution immediately increases to ca. 35\u00b0C and then returns to ca. 0\u00b0C. After 30 min the cold sodium cyanide solution is added in one portion. The reaction mixture again warms to ca. 15\u00b0C and then returns to ca. 0\u00b0C. This mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 0\u00b0C, during which time a thick white precipitate of sodium sulfite forms. The supernatant liquid is decanted into a 4-L separatory funnel and the precipitate is washed with 1 L of ice\u2013water. The combined aqueous solution is extracted with three 1-L portions of ethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 1 L of saturated brine and dried by stirring (magnetic stirring bar) over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr. The solution is filtered through a coarse, sintered-glass funnel and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure. After the pH of the residue is adjusted to 5 with a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 3), the residue is distilled to give 154\u2013192 g (60\u201375%) of 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, bp 108\u2013114\u00b0C (30 mm), as a colorless liquid (Note 4).\nB. 2-[(1'-Ethoxy)-1-ethoxy]butanenitrile. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a condenser topped with a calcium chloride drying tube, a magnetic stirring bar, a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 174 g (2.05 mol) of 2-hydroxybutanenitrile to which 0.5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. The addition funnel is charged with 221 g (3.07 mol) of ethyl vinyl ether (Note 5), which is then added dropwise to the stirring cyanohydrin at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at ca. 50\u00b0C. When the addition is complete, the mixture is heated to 90\u00b0C for 4 hr. The condenser is replaced with a distillation head and the dropping funnel and thermometer are replaced with stoppers. Direct distillation of the gold\u2013yellow solution from the reaction flask yields 226\u2013277 g (70\u201386%) of nearly pure 2-[(1'-ethoxy)-1-ethoxy]butanenitrile, bp 85\u201384\u00b0C (30 mm), as a colorless liquid (Note 6).\nC. 2-Hydroxy-2-methylpentan-3-one. A dry, 5-L, three-necked (including a thermometer well), round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, low-temperature thermometer, nitrogen inlet, rubber septum, and a 1-L, graduated, pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is sealed with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 775 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 7) and 166 g (1.64 mol) of dry diisopropylamine (Note 8). The contents of the flask are cooled to \u221210\u00b0C (dry ice\u2013acetone bath) and 1095 mL (1.6 mol) of 1.5 M butyllithium in hexane (Note 9), which has been transferred to the addition funnel by means of a 16-gauge cannula and argon pressure, is slowly added to the stirring solution at such a rate as to maintain a temperature of \u221210\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, 50 mL of dry THF is added to the addition funnel with syringe to rinse the walls of the funnel; the rinse is added, and then the mixture is cooled to \u221275\u00b0C. The addition funnel is charged by syringe with 246 g (1.6 mol) of 2-[(1'-ethoxy)-1-ethoxy]butanenitrile, which is then added at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed \u221270\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for 10 min and 104 g (1.8 mol) of dry acetone (Note 10) is added by syringe over a 30-min period at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed \u221270\u00b0C. When the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C. The solution is poured into 1 L of water and the resulting mixture is concentrated at aspirator pressure with a rotary evaporator (30\u00b0C water bath) to remove the volatile organic compounds. The aqueous residue is extracted with three 1-L portions of methylene chloride. The organic extracts are combined and washed with two 500-mL portions of water and then concentrated with a rotary evaporator (25\u00b0C water bath) at aspirator pressure to obtain a yellow syrupy residue. This material is stirred with 680 mL of methanol and 340 mL of aqueous 5% sulfuric acid overnight at room temperature. The methanol is evaporated with a rotary evaporator (30\u00b0C water bath) at aspirator pressure and the yellow residue is extracted with three 1-L portions of ethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are shaken in a 4-L separatory funnel with 210 mL of 10 N aqueous sodium hydroxide for 15 min (Note 11). The layers are separated, and the ether layer is washed with 500 mL of brine and dried by stirring (magnetic stirring bar) over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr. The drying agent is removed by filtration through a coarse sintered-glass funnel and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator (water bath below 40\u00b0C) at aspirator pressure. The yellow-orange liquid residue is distilled to obtain 82\u2013115 g (45\u201363%) of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-3-one, bp 57\u201365\u00b0C (15 mm), as a paleyellow liquid (Note 12) and (Note 13).\nD. 2-Methyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one. A dry, 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet, and a thermometer is charged with 84 g (0.72 mol) of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-3-one and 74 g (0.36 mol) of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (Note 14). The mixture is heated at 100\u00b0C for 12 hr with stirring and then cooled to room temperature, at which point the mixture becomes a semisolid as the acetamide crystallizes. The semisolid mixture is diluted with 50 mL of water and stirred at room temperature for 1 hr (Note 15). After the stirring is stopped, 200 mL of hexane is added and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 mL of hexane. The combined hexane extracts are washed with four 100-mL portions of water and then dried over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr. After removal of the drying agent by filtration through a coarse sintered-glass funnel, the hexane is evaporated with a rotary evaporator (25\u00b0C water bath) at aspirator pressure. The crude, pale-yellow oil is distilled to afford 105\u2013112 g (75\u201380%) of 2-methyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one, bp 71\u201375\u00b0C (15 mm), as a colorless liquid (Note 16)."

            "A. 5-Hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)heptan-3-one. A dry, 1-L, four-necked (including a thermometer well), round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, graduated 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel sealed with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with 125 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 1) and 31 mL (0.22 mol) of diisopropylamine (Note 2). The stirrer is started and 137 mL (0.20 mol) of 1.5 M butyllithium in hexane is transferred to the addition funnel by means of a 16-gauge cannula and argon pressure (Note 3). The reaction flask and its contents are cooled to below \u22125\u00b0C by immersion in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath that is maintained at \u221210 to \u221215\u00b0C by the occasional addition of dry ice. The butyllithium is added dropwise over a period of 20 min. After the addition is complete 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to the addition funnel with a syringe to rinse the walls of the funnel, and the rinse is then added to the pale-yellow solution. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred for an additional 15 min and is then cooled to below \u221270\u00b0C (dry ice\u2013acetone bath). While the reaction solution is cooling, a solution of 37.7 g (0.20 mol) of 2-methyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one (Note 4) in 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is introduced through the septum into the addition funnel. When the lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution has cooled to below \u221270\u00b0C, the ketone is slowly added to the solution over a period of 20\u201325 min to ensure that the reaction temperature is maintained below \u221270\u00b0C. After the addition is complete 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to rinse the walls of the addition funnel, the rinse is added, and the stirred reaction solution is maintained below \u221270\u00b0C for an additional 30\u201340 min. During this time the addition funnel is charged through the septum with a solution of 14.4 g (0.20 mol) of 2-methylpropanal (Note 5) in 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The aldehyde solution is added dropwise to the vigorously stirring yellow enolate solution at \u221270\u00b0C over a 15-min period, and then the addition funnel is again rinsed with 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and the rinse added to the reaction mixture. After 10\u201315 min 200 mL of a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added to the vigorously stirring, \u221270\u00b0C reaction mixture. At this point stirring is discontinued, the cooling bath is removed, and the partially frozen mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The contents of the reaction flask are introduced into a 2-L separatory funnel, 200 mL of ether is added to the flask, and the ether rinse is then transferred to the separatory funnel. The layers are shaken and then separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted again with 200 mL of ether. The combined organic phase is washed with 200 mL of water and 200 mL of saturated brine and then dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent by filtration the solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure to give 52.1\u201352.4 g of a pale-yellow oil that is a 63 : 37 mixture of the expected product and the starting material. Most of the starting material is then selectively removed by stirring (magnetic stirring bar) at 25\u00b0C at reduced pressure (vacuum pump, 0.1\u20130.08 mm) for 19 hr to yield 35.2 g of a 90 : 10 mixture (31.7 g, 61%), which is used without further purification for Step B (Note 6) and (Note 7).\nB.

A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet is flushed with nitrogen, charged with 12.5 g (55 mmol) of periodic acid (Note 8) and 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 1), and then sealed with a stoppered, 25-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The solution is stirred vigorously and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C with an ice\u2013salt bath. During this time the addition funnel is charged with a solution of 12.0 g of 5-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)heptan-3-one (10.8 g, 41 mmol of ketone from a 90 : 10 mixture from Part A) in 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, which is then rapidly introduced (1 min) to the cold, stirring solution. After the addition is complete 5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to the addition funnel to rinse the walls of the funnel, and the rinse is then added to the reaction solution. The cooling bath is removed after 15 min and stirring is continued for 1.5 hr, during which time a white precipitate forms. In the meantime, 52 g (0.5 mol) of sodium bisulfite is mixed with 100 mL of distilled water in a 500-mL filtering flask with a side hose connection and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C with an ice\u2013salt bath. The reaction mixture is filtered directly through filter paper with suction into the cold slurry of sodium bisulfite. The residue is rinsed with 50 mL of dry ether (Note 9), which is added to the filter funnel and drawn by suction into the yellow solution. After magnetic stirring of the cold mixture for 20 min the contents of the flask are introduced into a 500-mL separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer (pH 4.3) is extracted twice with 100 mL of ether and the combined yellow organic layer is washed with 125 mL of distilled water and separated (the pH of the wash is 2.6\u20133.5). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate for 1 hr and filtered to remove the drying agent, and the solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure. Distillation of the dark-yellow oil affords 4.9\u20135.4 g (82\u201389%) of (2SR,3RS)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid, bp 85\u201389\u00b0C (0.01 mm), as a viscous, yellow\u2013green liquid (Note 10). Crystallization from hexane using decolorizing carbon provides 4.6\u20135.0 g (77\u201383%) of pure hydroxy acid, mp 75\u201376\u00b0C, as white crystals (Note 11)."

            "A. 2,6-Dimethylphenyl propanoate. To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is added 26.4 g (0.55 mol) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil (Note 1). The sodium hydride is washed several times by decantation with dry hexane and is then covered with 1 L of dry ether (Note 2). The flask is immersed in an ice bath and equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser. A solution of 61.1 g (0.50 mol) of 2,6-dimethylphenol (Note 3) in 150 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over a 10-min period and the mixture is stirred for 5 min, during which time hydrogen evolution ceases. The cold solution is stirred continuously while a solution of 48 mL (50.9 g, 0.55 mol) of propanoyl chloride (Note 1) in 100 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over a 30-min period. After stirring for an additional hour the reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 200 mL of water. The mixture is shaken vigorously and the ether layer is separated and washed successively with 200 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide, 200 mL of water, and 200 mL of 4% hydrochloric acid, then dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator and the residue distilled through a short, indented Claisen apparatus to obtain 85\u201386 g (96\u201397%) of 2,6-dimethylphenyl propanoate, bp 60\u201365\u00b0C (0.05 mm) (Note 4).\nB. 2',6'-Dimethylphenyl (2SR,3SR)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoate. The reaction is carried out in a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is marked to hold 325 mL and is topped with a rubber septum pierced with a syringe needle attached to a source of dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2) and 69 mL (0.49 mol) of diisopropylamine (Note 1). Butyllithium (325 mL, 0.49 mol, 1.5 M in hexane) (Note 5) is transferred into the addition funnel with a cannula. The reaction flask and its contents are cooled to below \u22125\u00b0C by immersion in a bath of dry ice and isopropyl alcohol, which is maintained at \u221210 to \u221215\u00b0C by periodic additions of dry ice. The butyllithium is added dropwise at such a rate as to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture in the range 0 to \u22125\u00b0C. After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min and is then cooled to \u221270\u00b0C. While the reaction mixture is cooling, the septum is briefly removed and a solution of 85 g (0.48 mol) of 2,6-dimethylphenyl propanoate in 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to the addition funnel, the septum is replaced, and nitrogen is passed through the apparatus in a slow stream for 5 min. The ester is then added to the lithium diisopropylamide solution at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed \u221265\u00b0C. The total addition time is 30\u201340 min. After the addition is complete the reaction mixture is kept at \u221270\u00b0C for an additional hour, during which time the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 35.3 g (0.49 mol) of 2-methylpropanal (Note 1) in 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The aldehyde solution is added dropwise to the vigorously stirring enolate solution at such a rate as to maintain a reaction temperature of less than \u221265\u00b0C. After the addition is complete the reaction mixture is kept at \u221270\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. To the vigorously stirring solution is added 500 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. At this point stirring is discontinued, the cooling bath is removed, and the partially frozen mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The contents of the reaction flask are introduced into a large separatory funnel and diluted with 500 mL of ether. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with 300 mL of water and 300 mL of saturated brine and then dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent the solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator to give 112\u2013120 g of an oily semisolid, which is a 7 : 2 mixture of the \u03b2-hydroxy ester and 2,6-dimethylphenyl propanoate. This material may be crystallized from ether\u2013hexane to provide 70 g (60%) of pure \u03b2-hydroxy ester, mp 75.5\u201376\u00b0C (Note 6). However, it is not necessary to purify the crude product before hydrolysis to the \u03b2-hydroxy acid (Note 7).\nC. (2SR,3SR)-2,4-Dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. The crude product from the foregoing preparation (112\u2013120 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of methanol and placed in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask. A solution of 112 g (2 mol) of potassium hydroxide in a mixture of 500 mL of water and 500 mL of methanol is added with stirring, whereupon the reaction mixture warms to about 40\u00b0C. After stirring for 15 min crushed dry ice is added in portions to the vigorously stirring mixture until the pH is 7\u20138. The resulting solution is concentrated to a volume of about 500 mL with a rotary evaporator and extracted with two 300-mL portions of methylene chloride, which are discarded. The aqueous phase is then acidified to pH 1\u20132 by addition of 75 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (vigorous evolution of CO2) and extracted with two 500-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are washed with 200 mL of saturated brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator to obtain 36\u201353 g of (2SR,3SR)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid as a semisolid. Crystallization from hexane provides 30\u201343 g (41\u201360% overall yield) of pure hydroxy acid, mp 76\u201379\u00b0C (Note 8)."

The dry apparatus is filled with argon and kept under an inert gas pressure of ca. 100 mm against the atmosphere until the aqueous workup (Note 2); see Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nThe flask is charged through serum cap B with 17 mL (120 mmol) of diisopropylamine (Note 3) and 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 4), using syringe techniques. It is cooled to \u221275\u00b0C in a dry ice bath. With stirring, exactly 100 mmol of butyllithium (hexane solution) (Note 5) is introduced from the dropping funnel (Note 6) within 10 min, followed after 0.5 hr, by a mixture of 9.51 g (50 mmol) of ( \u2212 )-diethyl (S)-malate (Note 7) and 5 mL of THF, which is added dropwise through cap B at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above \u221260\u00b0C. The addition takes approximately 10 min (Note 8). The dry ice cooling bath is replaced by an ice\u2013salt bath (ca. \u221215\u00b0C) in which the contents of the flask warm to \u221220\u00b0C within 0.5 hr. The solution is stirred at \u221220\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C for 0.5 hr and then is cooled to \u221275\u00b0C.\nTo the solution of the alkoxide enolate thus prepared is added by syringe within 5 min 10.7 mL (124 mmol) of neat 3-bromo-1-propene (Note 9) at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above \u221270\u00b0C. Stirring is continued, first for 2 hr at \u221275\u00b0C, and then overnight while the temperature rises to \u22125\u00b0C (Note 10).\nThe reaction mixture is quenched by adding a solution of 12 g (200 mmol) of glacial acetic acid in 20 mL of diethyl ether at \u221250\u00b0C and is then poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of ether and 70 mL of water. The organic layer is washed successively with 40 mL each of saturated sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solution, and the aqueous phases are extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried by vigorous stirring with dry MgSO4 for 15 min. Removal of the solvent first with a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature no higher than 35\u00b0C and then at room temperature under oil pump vacuum (0.1 mm) furnishes 10.4 g of a yellow oil consisting, according to capillary gas chromatography (GC) (Note 11), of 81.3% of the desired allylated (2S,3R) product (73.5% yield), 8.5% of the (2S,3S) diastereoisomer (90.5% ds2), and 6.3% of the starting diethyl malate (Note 12).\nThe product is purified by flash chromatography (Note 13),(Note 14),(Note 15).

A 1 : 1 mixture of ether and pentane is used for elution, with a running rate of 5-cm column length per minute (pressure 1.25 atm). After a 200-mL forerun, 33-mL fractions are collected. No attempt is made to separate the two diastereoisomers; fractions 22\u201340 are combined to give 8.0 g (70%) of pure allylated product [ratio of diastereoisomers 92 : 8 (Note 11)], after removal of the solvent; [\u03b1]D20 + 11.2\u00b0 (chloroform, c 2.23) (Note 16)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, addition funnel, and an air motor-driven paddle stirrer is charged with 35.2 g (0.20 mol) of erythorbic acid (Note 1) and 500 mL of deionized water. The solution is stirred with ice bath cooling (Note 2), and 42.4 g (0.40 mol) of anhydrous, powdered sodium carbonate (Note 3) is added in small portions (Note 4). The resulting yellow solution (Note 5) is stirred with ice-bath cooling while 44 mL (0.45 mmol) of 31.3% by weight aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Note 6) is added dropwise over a 10-min period. The internal temperature rises from 6 to 19\u00b0C (Note 7). The solution, containing a few solid particles, is stirred for 5 min with ice bath cooling, during which time the internal temperature continues to rise to 27\u00b0C. The flask is now immersed in a water bath that is heated to 42\u00b0C. The solution is stirred for 30 min, during which time the internal temperature reaches a maximum of 42\u00b0C (Note 8). Norit A (8 g) is added in portions over 10 min to decompose the excess peroxide and the mixture is heated on a steam bath with continued stirring for 30 min, at which point gas evolution has essentially ceased and a negative starch\u2013iodide test is observed. The internal temperature reaches and is kept at 75\u201378\u00b0C. The hot mixture is filtered with suction on a Celite pad into a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask and the filtercake is washed, in several small portions, with a total of 100 mL of deionized water. The combined filtrate and washes are acidified to pH 1 by the cautious (Note 9) addition of 150 mL (0.90 mol) of 6 N aqueous hydrochloric acid, in portions, with swirling. The acidic solution is concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 50\u00b0C/water aspirator pressure. The residue is dried at 50\u00b0C/0.2 mm to give 84.6 g of a pale-yellow solid residue containing D-erythronolactone, oxalic acid, and sodium chloride (Note 10) and (Note 11). To this material is added 175 mL of acetone (Note 13) and the mixture is swirled to loosen the solids caked on the sides of the flask. A 50-g portion of anhydrous, powdered magnesium sulfate (Note 14) is now added and the mixture is stirred by means of an air motor-driven paddle stirrer as 350 mL (2.85 mol) of 2,2-dimethoxypropane (Note 15) is added in one portion. To the stirred mixture is added 0.42 g (0.0022 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate at room temperature. The slurry is blanketed with nitrogen and stirred at room temperature for 18 hr. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer and an air motor-driven paddle stirrer, a mixture of 500 mL of anhydrous ether and 61.3 mL (0.44 mol) of triethylamine (Note 16) is cooled in an ice bath to 5\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is decanted into this solution. The residual solids are rinsed with 60 mL of ether, which is also decanted into the triethylamine solution. After being stirred for a few minutes (Note 17), the mixture is filtered with suction on a 600-mL, coarse, sintered-glass funnel. The solids are washed thoroughly with a total of 300 mL of anhydrous ether by slurrying three times on the funnel with the vacuum turned off; the vacuum is then applied to draw the wash ether through the funnel. The filtrate and washes are combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure, and the residue is dried at 45\u00b0C/0.5 mm to give 34.3 g of a pale-yellow solid (Note 18). This material is dissolved in approximately 150 mL of 1 : 1 hexanes : ethyl acetate and the solution (Note 19) is adsorbed on a column of 200 g of silica gel (Note 20) packed in 1 : 1 hexanes : ethyl acetate. The column is eluted with a total volume of 2 L of 1 : 1 hexanes : ethyl acetate (Note 21). The eluate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure and the solid residue is dried under high vacuum to afford 27.3 g of a colorless solid. This material, contained in a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, is treated with 150 mL of anhydrous ether and the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for 5 min to dissolve all the solid. The solution is removed from the steam bath and treated with 225 mL of hexanes. An immediate precipitate results. The mixture is refrigerated (0\u00b0C) for 3.5 hr and then filtered with suction. The solid is washed with a total of 100 mL of hexanes, in small portions, and then dried under high vacuum at 20\u00b0C. There is obtained 23.6 g (74.7%) of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone as a white solid, mp 65.5\u201366\u00b0C, [\u03b1]25D \u2212113.8\u00b0 (c 1.11 H2O) (Note 22),(Note 23),(Note 24),(Note 25)."

        "Procedure": [
            "Caution! A. Because of the hydrogen gas evolved during this reaction, this procedure should be carried out in an efficient fume hood.\nAn oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a Friedrich condenser, and a nitrogen-inlet tube is flushed with nitrogen, and then charged with a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (47.9 g, 1.26 mol) in 1200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1). The mixture is cooled (10\u00b0C, ice bath) and L-valine (100 g, 0.85 mol) is added in portions over a 30-min period from a 200-mL round-bottomed flask connected to the reaction flask via a flexible plastic sleeve so as not to produce too vigorous an evolution of hydrogen (Note 2). After the addition is complete, the plastic sleeve is replaced by a stopper, the ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and then refluxed for 16 hr. The reaction mixture is then cooled again (10\u00b0C, ice bath) and diluted with ethyl ether (1000 mL) (Note 3). The reaction is quenched over a 30-min period with water (47 mL) (Caution! See (Note 4), aqueous 15% sodium hydroxide (47 mL, over 20 min), and water (141 mL, over 30 min). The solution is stirred for 30 min and the white precipitate is filtered. The filter cake is washed with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 150 mL) and the organic filtrates are combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residue under vacuum affords L-valinol (63.9\u201365.7 g, 73\u201375%) (Note 5) as a clear liquid: bp 63\u201365\u00b0C (0.9 mm) (Note 6): [\u03b1]D20 + 14.6\u00b0 (neat); nD20 1.455; IR (neat) cm1: 3300, 1590; 1H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4: 0.92 (d, 6 H), 2.38\u20132.74 (m, 4 H), 3.13\u20133.78 (m, 2 H).\nB. Caution! Because of the foul odor of the methyl sulfide given off, this procedure, up to the methanol quench, should be carried out in a hood.\nA 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, heating mantel, 250-mL graduated addition funnel, and an 8-in., air-cooled reflux condenser (West type) topped with a water-cooled distillation head and a 1-L receiving flask. It is connected to a nitrogen line through the still head. The glassware is either oven-dried and cooled in a desiccator or flame-dried and assembled while still hot. The assembly is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 200 g of L-valine (1.7 mol), 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1), and 210 mL of freshly distilled boron trifluoride etherate (242 g, 1.7 mol). The mixture is heated at a rate sufficient to cause the THF to reflux gently (Note 7) and 188 mL (1.88 mol) of borane\u2013methyl sulfide complex (BMS) (Note 8) is added dropwise over the course of 2 hr (Note 9). The solution is then refluxed for 18 hr. The methyl sulfide that has collected at the stillhead is discarded (Note 10), and the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C and quenched by the slow addition of 200 mL of methanol. The addition funnel is replaced by a glass stopper, and the air-cooled condenser is removed, leaving the flask equipped for distillation of solvent through the distillation head. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure with heating and stirring. The distillation head is replaced by a water-cooled reflux condenser, and the residue is dissolved in 1 L of 6 M sodium hydroxide and refluxed for 4 hr. The mixture is saturated with potassium carbonate (ca. 400 g); cooled; filtered through a Celite pad on a coarse, fritted funnel; and extracted with three 1-L portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are washed with three portions of saturated sodium chloride (500 mL each), stirred over anhydrous potassium carbonate for 24 hr, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil. The crude material is vacuum distilled to give 77.5 g (44%) of purified L-valinol, bp 62\u201367\u00b0C/2.5 mm(Note 6); [\u03b1]D20 + 14.6\u00b0 (neat), nD20 1.455; IR (neat film) cm\u22121: 3300 (OH), and 1590 (NH2); NMR \u03b4: 0.92 (d, 6 H), 1.54 (m, 1 H), 2.38\u20132.74 (m, 4 H), 3.13\u20133.78 (m, 2 H)."

Into a three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and reflux condenser are placed 10.8 g (0.284 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride and 200 mL of dry ethyl ether. To this slurry is added, from the dropping funnel, 33 g (0.28 mol) of ethyl L-( \u2212 )-lactate (Note 1) in 150 mL of dry ethyl ether at a rate that maintains a steady reflux. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 3 hr. Then 25 mL (1.39 mol) of water is carefully added and stirring is continued for a further 1.5 hr. The mixture is filtered and the white solid (LiOH) is washed well with ether and dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to give a portion of the crude product (3 g). Aqueous 1 M sulfuric acid is added to the solid until the milky suspension is just acidic (pH 6\u20136.5). The suspension is subjected to continuous extraction with twice its volume of dichloromethane (about 500 mL) for 168 hr. The dichloromethane layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator.

The neutral solution is extracted three times with 150 mL of ethyl ether, the organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the crude product at reduced pressure affords 14.1\u201315.4 g (78\u201385%) of (S)-( \u2212 )-2-acetoxy-1-bromopropane, bp 54\u201357\u00b0C (7 mm), as a colorless liquid (Note 5).\nC.

To a three-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 10-cm Vigreux column connected to an efficiently cooled condenser and receiver are added 9.05 g (50 mmol) of the acetoxybromopropane and 20 mL of dry 1-pentanol. The solution is stirred at room temperature and 41.66 mL (50 mmol) of 1.2 M potassium pentoxide in 1-pentanol (Note 6) is added from the dropping funnel over ca. 20 min. A white precipitate of potassium bromide is observed. After addition is complete, the flask is warmed in an oil bath at ca. 130\u2013145\u00b0C to attain distillation (Note 7).

The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 500 mL of anhydrous toluene (Note 2) and 52.9 g (2.3 g-atom) of sodium cut in small pieces (Note 3) are introduced. The mixture is brought to reflux by means of a heating mantle and the sodium is finely pulverized by vigorous stirring. Heating and stirring are stopped (Note 4), and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. Toluene is removed under nitrogen pressure by means of a double-ended needle and replaced by 500 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 5) and (Note 6). At this point, 108.5 g (1 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 7) is added to the flask. To the mixture, 136.58 g (1 mol) of ethyl 3-chloropropanoate is added dropwise with stirring at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux over a 3-hr period (Note 8). When about 0.3 mol of chloro ester has been added, a deep-blue precipitate appears (Note 9). When the addition is over, the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 30 min. The contents of the flask are cooled and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel under a stream of dry nitrogen (Note 10). The precipitate is washed twice with 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether.\nThe colorless filtrate is transferred to a distilling flask and the solvent is distilled through a 25-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. After a small forerun (1\u20132 g), 1-ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane is obtained at 43\u201345\u00b0C (12 mm) as a colorless liquid, 106 g (61%) (Note 11).\nB. Cyclopropanone ethyl hemiacetal. Into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 250 mL of reagent-grade methanol. Freshly distilled 1-ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane (100 g, 0.56 mol) is added all at once to the methanol and the solution is stirred overnight (12 hr) at room temperature (Note 12). An aliquot (50 mL) of the solution is concentrated by slow evaporation of methanol with a rotary evaporator at room temperature (Note 13) and formation of the methanolysis product is checked by NMR examination of the residue (Note 14). When the reaction is complete (Note 15), the solution is concentrated by removal of the methanol (Note 16). Distillation of the residue through a 20-cm helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column under reduced pressure gives 52 g (89%) of 1-ethoxycyclopropanol, bp 60\u00b0C (20 mm) (Note 14) and (Note 17), which contains trace amounts of 1-methoxycyclopropanol (Note 18) and (Note 19)."

            "Caution! Hexafluoroacetone and its precursor are toxic. Both procedures should be conducted in an efficient hood.\nA. 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithietane. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a good magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, water-cooled condenser, and a fritted gas inlet tube (Note 1). The outlet of the condenser is attached to a tared \u221278\u00b0C cold trap and the inlet tube is connected via flexible tubing to a graduated \u221278\u00b0C cold trap into which 60 mL (96 g, 0.64 mol) of hexafluoropropene has been condensed under nitrogen. The flask is charged with 3 g of potassium fluoride and is flamed gently under vacuum. The apparatus is cooled while purging with nitrogen. Sulfur (23 g, 0.72 mol) and 200 mL of dry dimethylformamide are then added (Note 2). The reaction mixture is heated to 40\u201345\u00b0C with stirring. The heat source is removed, the stopcock on the trap containing the hexafluoropropene is opened, and the trap is gently thawed. The rate of hexafluoropropene bubbling into the reaction mixture is adjusted to about 0.6 mL (1 g) / min by cooling or warming the trap containing the hexafluoropropene (Note 3),(Note 4),(Note 5). When all the hexafluoropropene has been added, the reaction mixture is cooled to \u221220\u00b0C to \u221230\u00b0C and quickly filtered under suction (Note 6). The filtercake is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and is allowed to melt. Water (50 mL) is added, and the mixture is filtered. The lower liquid phase is separated, washed with 50 mL of water, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure to give 93.0\u201399.4 g (80\u201385%) of product, bp 106\u2013108\u00b0C (Note 7).\nB. Hexafluoroacetone. A 1-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and condenser. A \u221278\u00b0C glass trap is attached to the condenser via flexible tubing. While the system is purged with nitrogen, 3 g of potassium fluoride is added and the flask and potassium fluoride are flame-dried (Note 8). After the flask has cooled, 300 mL of dry dimethylformamide, 80 g (0.374 mol) of powdered potassium iodate, and 60 g (0.165 mol) of 2,2,4,4-tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithietane are added (Note 9). The stirrer and water condenser are started and the reaction mixture is heated over a 45-min period to 149\u00b0C and is kept at 149\u00b0C for an additional 15 min. The heat source is then removed, and a slow stream of nitrogen is used to flush any remaining product gas into the cold trap (Note 8). The condensate is transferred under vacuum to a tared, evacuated-gas cylinder (Note 10). The cylinder contains 37.0\u201339.9 g (68\u201373%) of material (Note 11). This material is distilled to give 35.0\u201337.6 g (64\u201369%) of pure product, bp \u221228\u00b0C [lit.2 bp \u221227\u00b0C] (Note 12)."

            "A 4-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an efficient stirrer, a dropping funnel, reflux condenser, and thermometer is charged with a solution of 44 g (1.1 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 1.1 L of water. Stirring is initiated and 165.2 g (1 mol) of L-phenylalanine (Note 1) is added at ambient temperature, and then diluted with 750 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (Note 2). To the well-stirred, clear solution (Note 3) is added dropwise within 1 hr, 223 g (1 mol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Note 4). A white precipitate appears during addition of the di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. After a short induction period, the temperature rises to about 30\u201335\u00b0C. The reaction is brought to completion by further stirring overnight at room temperature. At this time, the clear solution will have reached a pH of 7.5\u20138.5. The reaction mixture is extracted two times with 250 mL of pentane, and the organic phase is extracted three times with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The combined aqueous layers are acidified to pH 1\u20131.5 by careful addition of a solution of 224 g (1.65 mol) of potassium hydrogen sulfate in 1.5 L of water (Note 5). The acidification is accompanied by copious evolution of carbon dioxide. The turbid reaction mixture is then extracted with four 400-mL portions of ethyl ether (Note 6). The combined organic layers are washed two times with 200 mL of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C (Note 7). The yellowish oil that remains is treated with 150 mL of hexane and allowed to stand overnight (Note 8). Within 1 day the following portions of hexane are added with stirring to the partially crystallized product: 2 \u00d7 50 mL, 4 \u00d7 100 mL, and 1 \u00d7 200 mL. The solution is placed in a refrigerator overnight; the white precipitate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold pentane. The solid is dried under reduced pressure at ambient temperature to constant weight to give a first crop. The mother liquor is evaporated to dryness leaving a yellowish oil, which is treated in the same manner as described above, giving a second crop (Note 9). The total yield of pure white N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanine is 207\u2013230 g (78\u201387%), mp 86\u201388\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D20 + 25.5\u00b0 (ethanol, c 1.0) (Note 10)."

The resulting mixture is gently refluxed and stirred for 2 hr and then cooled to room temperature and filtered through a Celite plug. The dark-brown filtrate is concentrated under vacuum (Rotavapor) to a gummy residue and then diluted with 50 mL of water followed by 100 mL of ether and acidified with 6 N hydrochloric acid to pH 2. The ether\u2013water layers are decanted from any residue, the ether layer is separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted with ether (5 \u00d7 50 mL). The ether extracts are combined and washed with small portions of water until pH 6.5 is reached.

After removal of ether by distillation through a 20-cm Vigreux column (water aspirator vacuum) while heating on a water bath, \u226440\u00b0C, the residual liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure through a 10-cm Vigreux column.

            "A. N-Carbomethoxypyrrolidine. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a Graham condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a mechanical stirrer. The flask is charged with 200 g (1.89 mol) of sodium carbonate (Note 1), 400 mL of methylene chloride (Note 2), and 71 g (1 mol) of pyrrolidine (Note 3). The dropping funnel is charged with 103 g (1.1 mol) of methyl chlorocarbonate (Note 3), which is added with stirring over a 2-hr period at a rate that sustains a gentle reflux. After the addition of methyl chlorocarbonate is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. The white precipitate is filtered with suction through a coarse B\u00fcchner funnel and washed three times with 100 mL of methylene chloride. The filtrate is concentrated on a vacuum rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 30\u00b0C. The crude oily product is distilled under reduced pressure through a Claisen flask to yield 119\u2013121 g (92\u201394%) of N-carbomethoxypyrrolidine, bp 64\u00b0C/1.3 mm.\nB. 2-Methoxy-N-carbomethoxypyrrolidine. A solution of N-carbomethoxypyrrolidine (12.7 g, 0.098 mol) and tetraethylammonium p-toluenesulfonate (0.83 g, 0,0027 mol) (Note 3) in 83 mL of methanol (Note 2) is added into an undivided jacketed cell (Note 4) equipped with two graphite-rod anodes and two graphite-rod cathodes, (Note 5) a thermometer, an exit tube for venting purposes, and a magnetic stirring bar. The carbon rods (0.6 cm in diameter, immersed 5.5 cm into the solution, resulting in a working electrode surface of 21.3 cm2 and a current density of 46.9 mA/cm2) are spaced 4.5 mm apart. The anode rods and the two cathode rods are connected with No. 22 copper wire as shown in Figure 1. During the electrolysis (Note 6), the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0C (Note 7) by cooling with tap water. After 2.34F/mol of electricity (1 A, 6 hr; the voltage between the anode and cathode was 19\u201324 V for the example in Figure 1) has been passed through, (Note 8) the current is stopped and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 120 mL of methylene chloride and washed with aqueous NaCl (20 mL). The aqueous NaCl wash is reextracted with methylene chloride (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The methylene chloride phases are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated and the residue is distilled, employing a 5 cm Vigreux column and an oil bath at 80\u201390\u00b0C (Note 9). The yield is 12.3\u201313.0 g (78\u201383%), bp 48\u201355\u00b0C/0.2\u20130.5 mm (Note 10).\nFigure 1. Electrolysis cell for methoxylation."

Most of the DMF is removed on a rotary evaporator (20 mm) and the oily residue is poured into 400 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide and extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 800 mL). The combined extracts are dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated to give 203.5 g of yellowish solid. Recrystallization from 1 L of methanol cooled to 0\u00b0C affords 177.6 (90%) of 6-benzyloxy-2-nitrotoluene as pale-yellow crystals, mp 61\u201363\u00b0C3 (Note 2).\nB.

The solution is heated at reflux (110\u00b0C) for 3 hr (Note 4) under nitrogen and allowed to cool to room temperature. The volatile components are removed on a rotary evaporator, and the red residue (Note 5) is dissolved in 200 mL of methylene chloride and 1.60 L of methanol. The solution is concentrated to a volume of about 1.40 L on the steam bath and then is cooled to 5\u00b0C. Filtration and washing of the filtercake with 200 mL of cold methanol affords 209.8 g of red crystals, mp 87\u201389\u00b0C (Note 6).

Vigorous gas evolution is observed. The red color turns to dark brown within 10 min, and the reaction temperature rises to 46\u00b0C. An additional 44 mL of 85% hydrazine hydrate is added after 30 min and again 1 hr later. The temperature is maintained between 45 and 50\u00b0C with a water bath during the reaction and for 2 hr after the last addition.

The filtrate is evaporated and the residue dried by evaporating with 500 mL of toluene. The reddish residue (118.5 g), dissolved in ca. 1 L of toluene-cyclohexane (1 : 1), is applied to a column of 500 g of silica gel (70\u2013230-mesh, Merck) prepared in the same solvent. Elution with 6.0 L of toluene\u2013cyclohexane (1 : 1) followed by 3 L of toluene\u2013cyclohexane (1 : 2) affords 108.3 g of white solid, which is crystallized from 150 mL of toluene and 480 mL of cyclohexane (Note 12).

An argon or nitrogen (Note 3) atmosphere is established in the flask by repeated cycles of evacuation with an oil pump and refilling with the inert gas. Through use of a syringe or cannula, 150 mL of diethyl ether (Note 4) and 120 mL of dimethyl sulfide (Note 4)) are added. After the mixture is stirred for a few minutes at 25\u00b0C, the resulting clear and colorless solution is cooled to\u221245\u00b0C (Note 5) and (Note 6). A 2.73 M solution (45.0 mL, 0.123 mol) of ethylmagnesium bromide in ether (Note 7) is added dropwise with a syringe or cannula over a period of 10 min. The suspension of yellow\u2013orange solid is stirred at\u221245\u00b0C for 2 hr, and 1-octyne (16.0 mL, 0.109 mol; (Note 4)) is added with a syringe or cannula over a period of 2 min.

            "A dry, 5-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an air-driven stirrer (Note 1), 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, thermometer, rubber septum, and a nitrogen-inlet tube that, by means of a T-tube, is also connected to a gas bubbler. After being charged with 1200 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2), the flask is swept with dry nitrogen and maintained under an atmosphere of nitrogen throughout the remainder of the reaction. A solution of ethylmagnesium bromide in diethyl ether (1.1 mol, 380 mL, 2.9 M) is transferred to the flask and the flask is then cooled to below 10\u00b0C by means of an ice\u2013water bath (Note 3). Propyne is bubbled through the cooled, stirred solution (Note 4) at such a rate that a small amount escapes through the nitrogen inlet\u2013gas bubbler. Propyne addition is continued for 2.5 hr, at which time approximately 100 g (2.5 mol) of propyne has been used (Note 5) and the internal temperature has risen 5\u201310\u00b0C. The ice\u2013water bath is then replaced with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and the mixture is cooled to ca. \u221270\u00b0C. A solution of 2-chlorocyclohexanone (1 mol, 132.6 g) (Note 6) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise from the addition funnel over 1.5 hr so as to maintain the temperature below \u221265\u00b0C (Note 7). After stirring for an additional 1.5 hr at \u221270\u00b0C (Note 8), the dry ice\u2013acetone bath is replaced with an ambient-temperature water bath and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly. When the temperature reaches 10\u00b0C, a solution of lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran (1 mol, 1000 mL, 1 M) is added by cannula (Note 9). After addition of the lithium aluminum hydride, the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 3\u20135 hr, at which time the solids have dissolved and reaction is complete (Note 10) and (Note 11). The solution is then cooled to 5\u00b0C by means of an ice\u2013water bath. The reaction is quenched by careful, dropwise addition of 38 mL of water over 2 hr to maintain the temperature below 20\u00b0C. The solution becomes somewhat cloudy at this point and 2000 mL of hexanes is added. The addition of 38 mL of aqueous 15% sodium hydroxide solution over 15 min is followed by the addition of 100 mL of water over 5 min. Some frothing occurs during the last addition of water and a large amount of white aluminum salts precipitates. After 5 min of stirring, 100 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate is added and stirring is continued for another 5 min. The thick mixture is then filtered by suction through Celite using a 200-mm-diameter B\u00fcchner funnel. The solids are removed from the funnel, thoroughly washed with 1500 mL of hot tetrahydrofuran (Note 12), and refiltered. This wash is repeated twice and the combined organic solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator (15 mm). The residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to yield 118.8 g (85%) of 2-E-propenylcyclohexanol as a clear colorless liquid, bp 49\u201354\u00b0C (1 mm) (Note 13)."

To this magnetically stirred solution is added at one time 4-acetylpyridine (36.3 g, 0.30 mol) (Note 2); a precipitate forms rapidly. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u20135\u00b0C for 2 hr; then the precipitate is collected by suction filtration and washed with 500 mL of cold water.\nThe product, (mp 122\u2013146\u00b0C, 33\u201336 g, 81\u201388%) can be shown from its 1H NMR spectrum (Note 3) to be a 5:1 mixture of the E- and Z-isomers of 4-acetylpyridine oxime. To obtain pure E-isomer (Note 4), the product is recrystallized twice as follows. The crude product is dissolved in 600 mL of hot water in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask, the hot solution is decanted from any undissolved residue, and the supernatant liquid is allowed to cool slowly to 30\u00b0C during 2\u20133 hr by placing the flask on a cork ring.

The reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C for 24 hr; a precipitate of pyridine hydrochloride forms. A 500-mL portion of ice water is added with continued stirring. the initial precipitate dissolves, and a voluminous white precipitate soon forms. This is collected by suction filtration, washed with three 150-mL portions of cold water and dried under reduced pressure and over Drierite to constant weight. The yield of pure tosylate, mp 79\u201381\u00b0C (Note 8), is 55.1 g (95%).\nC. 2,2-Diethoxy-2-(4-pyridyl)ethylamine. To a 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing 80 mL of absolute ethanol (Note 9) and fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser with a drying tube, potassium metal (7.60 g, 0.19 mol) is slowly added (Note 10).

During this period a precipitate of potassium p-toluenesulfonate forms. The temperature of the stirred mixture is allowed to rise to room temperature for 1 hr. The mixture is diluted with 1 L of anhydrous ether and filtered by suction. The precipitate is quickly washed with 150 mL of anhydrous ether. The ether filtrates are combined, and hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the ether solution for 15 min. A precipitate forms immediately. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with three 170-mL portions of anhydrous ether, and dried briefly under reduced pressure. The dihydrochloride thus obtained is dissolved in 200 mL of water, and powdered sodium carbonate is added until the mixture reaches a pH of >10. The mixture is extracted four times with 125-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure to an oil.

A solution of 64 g (1.60 mol) of sodium hydroxide (Note 2) in 1.15 L of methanol is prepared in the flask, cooled in an ice bath, and stirred as 273 g (1.57 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate (Note 3) is added dropwise. The resulting slurry is stirred and heated to reflux, at which point the white salt dissolves. The heating mantle is removed, and the solution is stirred rapidly while 128.5 g of aqueous 40% glyoxal (51.4 g, 0.886 mol) (Note 3) and (Note 4) is added at a rate sufficient to maintain the internal temperature at 65\u00b0C (Note 5). After the addition is completed (40\u201360 min, (Note 6)), the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred overnight (Note 7).

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a theromometer is charged with 200 mL of pyridine (Note 5) and 32.3 g (0.448 mol) of cyclobutanol. The solution is stirred and chilled to 0\u00b0C, and then 89.8 g (0.471 mol) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 6) is added in portions over a 20-min period. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 16 hr. The mixture is recooled to 0\u00b0C, and poured into 260 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 800 mL of ice water. The mixture is extracted with three 300-mL portions of ether and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is held under high vacuum (0.03 mm) at room temperature for 3 hr to give 93.3 g (92%) of cyclobutyl tosylate as a pale-yellow oil (Note 7).\nC. Cyclobutene. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 100-mL dropping funnel equipped with an argon-inlet tube, a magnetic stirring bar, and a water-cooled condenser. The outlet of the condenser is attached to an all-glass transfer manifold. Two weighed traps fitted with gastight stopcocks and immersed in dry ice\u2013acetone baths are attached to the manifold. A calcium chloride drying tube is attached to the exit of the second trap. While the system is continuously purged with a slow stream of argon, the flask is charged with 33.6 g (0.30 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide and 120 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 8), and a solution of 25.6 g (0.113 mol) of cyclobutyl tosylate in 30 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide is placed in the dropping funnel. The potassium tert-butoxide suspension is stirred vigorously and heated to 70\u00b0C. The cyclobutyl tosylate solution is then added dropwise over a 10-min period (Note 9). After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred at 70\u00b0C for an additional 2 hr. The manifold system is closed off from the reaction vessel and the material collected in the first trap is slowly warmed. The product distills at ca. 2\u00b0C into the second dry-ice-cooled trap to give 4.3\u20135.1 g (70\u201384%) of cyclobutene [lit.2 bp 2\u00b0C] (Note 10),(Note 11),(Note 12)."

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen-inlet adapter, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and stopper is charged with 26.0 g (0.10 mol) of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-D-glucofuranose, 25 mg of imidazole (Note 1), and 400 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained during the ensuing steps. Over a 5-min period, 7.2 g (0.150 mol) of a 50% sodium hydride dispersion (Note 3) is added. Vigorous gas evolution is observed. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min, 22.8 g (0.30 mol) of carbon disulfide is added all at once. Stirring is continued for 30 min, after which time 25.3 g (0.177 mol) of iodomethane is added in a single portion. The reaction mixture is stirred for another 15 min, and 5.0 mL of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise to destroy excess sodium hydride. The solution is filtered (Note 4) and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The semisolid residue is extracted with three 100-mL portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed with two 100-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and two 100-mL portions of water. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The product is dried further at 0.05 mm overnight. The resulting orange syrup is distilled (Kugelrohr) to give 32.2\u201333.0 g (92\u201394%) of product, bp 153\u2013160\u00b0C (0.5\u20131.0 mm) (Note 5).\nB. 3-Deoxy-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexofuranose. A dry, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser to which a nitrogen inlet is attached. The apparatus is charged with 500 mL of anhydrous toluene (Note 6), 24.7 g (0.085 mol) of tributyltin hydride (Note 7) and 19.25 g (0.055 mol) of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-O-(S-methyldithiocarbonate)-\u03b1-D-glucofuranose. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere until TLC analysis indicates the disappearance of starting materials (4\u20137 hr) (Note 8). During this time the reaction solution changes from deep yellow to nearly colorless. The toluene is removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a thick, oily residue that is partitioned between 250-mL portions of petroleum ether and acetonitrile. The acetonitrile layer is separated and washed with three 100-mL portions of petroleum ether and is then concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow oil is taken up in hexane-ethyl acetate (10 : 1) and filtered through a pad of silica gel (Note 9). The filtrate is concentrated and the residual oil is distilled to give 10.0 g (75%) of product as a colorless syrup, bp 72\u201373\u00b0C (0.2 mm); nD25 1.4474 (Note 10)."

A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and mineral oil bubbler (Note 1). The flask is charged with cyanuric chloride (73.8 g, 0.4 mol) (Note 2), N,N-dimethylformamide (175.4 g, 2.4 mol) (Note 3), and 1,4-dioxane (100 mL) (Note 4). The resulting solution is stirred and heated (at approximately 85\u00b0C) for 2\u20133 hr while a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is evolved (Note 5). When gas evolution is minimal, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature; the product rapidly solidifies. The flask that contains the solid product is connected to an isopropyl alcohol\u2013dry ice trap and the solvent is removed by evacuating the system to approximately 0.05 mm pressure. The crude product weighs 186\u2013187 g (95%) and melts at 95\u2013103\u00b0C (Note 6), (Note 7), (Note 8).\nB. N,N-Dimethyl-N'-p-tolylformamidine. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar coated with Teflon is placed under a positive nitrogen pressure and charged with 100 mL of methanol (Note 9). Sodium metal (1.4 g, 0.06 mol) (Note 10) is then added in small portions. After all of the sodium has reacted, p-toluidine (6.4 g, 0.06 mol) (Note 11) is added and the resulting solution is stirred for 5 min. The iminium salt (10.6 g, 0.065 mol) produced in Step A is added in one portion and the resulting mixture is refluxed with stirring overnight. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue is taken up in chloroform (100 mL) and extracted twice with a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The chloroform phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual dark-brown liquid is distilled using a Kugelrohr apparatus (Note 12); the major fraction boils at 85\u2013100\u00b0C (oven temperature), 0.4 mm, and yields 9.1\u20139.2 g (94\u201395%) of a pale-yellow liquid (Note 13) and (Note 14)."

O-Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine.2 A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, drying tube, an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a nitrogen-inlet tube, is charged with 300 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride, 16.5 g (0.5 mol) of hydroxylamine base (Note 1), and 1.0 g of dry sodium bicarbonate. While the suspension is stirred vigorously at \u221230\u00b0C (bath temperature), a solution of 52.06 g (0.22 mol) of diphenylphosphinyl chloride (Note 2) in 70 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride is added under a nitrogen atmosphere at a constant rate within 30 min. The resulting thick suspension is stirred at \u221230\u00b0C for 2 hr and for an additional 2 hr after the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3) and the residue is washed with two 80-mL portions of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride is removed from the colorless solid by a stream of air for 2 hr. The dry solid, still on the funnel, is then mixed thoroughly with 200 mL of deionized water. The water is removed by suction. The same operation is performed sequentially with 150 mL of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then with two 150-mL portions of water. This solid, which retains water tenaciously, is dried by suction and by pressing down on the funnel for several hours, followed by drying in a phosphorus pentoxide-charged vacuum desiccator until its weight is constant (24 hr) to give 36 g (70%) of impure O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine, mp 120\u2013135\u00b0C, with decomposition.\nA 500-mL, two-necked flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and a drying tube, is charged with 240 mL of anhydrous ethanol. The solvent is preheated to 70\u00b0C and a 12-g portion of this finely powdered dry product is added all at once. The resulting suspension is refluxed for 2\u20133 min when almost all of the solid has dissolved. The hot solution is filtered as quickly as possible through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3) and the filtrate is chilled to 0\u00b0C for 30 min. Isolation of the crystalline deposit and washing with 20 mL of ether provides 7.8 g of pure product. Recrystallization of three 12-g portions furnishes 23.4 g (44%) of O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine, mp >140\u00b0C, with decomposition (Note 3).\nB. 7-Benzylideneaminotheophylline. A 2000-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and drying tube, is charged with 600 mL of anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidone (Note 4) and 20.2 g (0.1 mol) of anhydrous theophylline sodium salt (Note 5). The flask is cooled with an ice\u2013salt bath to 0\u00b0C (internal temperature). Then 23.4 g (0.1 mol) of O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine is added in three equal portions while the suspension is stirred vigorously. After the ice\u2013salt bath is removed, the resulting viscous suspension is stirred for 6 hr at 20\u00b0C.\nAfter the solution is diluted with 1200 mL of water, the pH is adjusted to 1\u20132 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the mixture stirred at 5\u00b0C for 1 hr. The precipitated diphenylphosphinic acid is isolated by filtration and washed with 50 mL of water (Note 6). The filtrate is placed in a 2000-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and an efficient mechanical stirrer. A solution of 20 mL of benzaldehyde in 50 mL of ether is added and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 20 min. The precipitate that forms is isolated by filtration and washed sequentially with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of ether to yield 19.6 g (69%) of 7-benzylideneaminotheophylline, mp 207\u2013209\u00b0C.3 An analytical sample may be prepared by recrystallization from ethanol (mp 209\u00b0C).\nC. 7-Aminotheophylline.

The suspension is steam-distilled until no more benzaldehyde is detected in the distillate (Note 7). The resulting clear solution in the reaction flask is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 30 mL, adjusted to pH 10 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with five 60-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation.

The ice\u2013salt bath is maintained in position throughout the 90 min of addition. The stirred reaction mixture is then gradually allowed to warm to room temperature over the next 8\u201310 hr. The reaction is carefully quenched at room temperature by dropwise addition of 1 : 1 water : acetic acid (ca. 20 mL) with stirring until no more gas evolution occurs. The reaction is concentrated at room temperature and water pump pressure to a slurry by removal of most of the tetrahydrofuran. The slurry is carefully poured over a 20-min period into 300 mL of ice-cold, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution with mechanical stirring to avoid precipitation of solids, and the product is extracted with 300 mL of ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer is again extracted with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layers are combined, washed once with 200 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate, then dried well with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.\nSolvent removal at reduced pressure gives 61 g (67% yield) of essentially pure ethyl hydroxycrotonate (Note 5).\nAn analytical sample may be prepared by quick distillation (or Kugelrohr distillation) at 117\u2013120\u00b0C (15 mm), but there is significant loss of material because of decomposition in the distillation pot.

One neck is fitted with a gas inlet joint connected to a nitrogen line equipped with a mineral oil bubbler. The second neck is fitted with a low-temperature thermometer, and the third is closed with a rubber serum cap after nitrogen has been passed through the flask for a few minutes. The flask is then immersed in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. While the ether is cooling, 85 mL (60.0 g, 1.50 mol) of propyne (Note 2) is condensed into a flask (Note 3). The stopper is removed briefly, the cold (\u221278\u00b0C) propyne is poured into the flask through a powder funnel inserted into the neck, and stirring is commenced. The stopper is replaced, and 667 mL of a 1.5 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is introduced by syringe at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221265\u00b0C (Note 4)\u2013(Note 6). During the butyllithium addition a copious white precipitate appears. The slurry is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 30 min, and 134 mL (152 g, 1.4 mol) of ethyl chloroformate (Note 7) is added. At this point, the acetone\u2013dry ice bath is replaced by an ice bath and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight. During this time the ice bath will melt and the reaction mixture should eventually reach room temperature. The mixture is poured onto 400 g of crushed ice, the layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The ether solutions are combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After filtration, the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator (Note 8). The residue is distilled at aspirator pressure to obtain 107\u2013108 g (95\u201397%) of ethyl tetrolate, bp 60\u201364\u00b0C (20 mm) [lit.2 105\u00b0C (90 mm)] (Note 9).\nB. Ethyl isocrotonate. An oven-dried, 500-mL hydrogenation flask equipped with a sidearm fitted with a rubber serum cap and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 0.4 g of 5% palladium on barium sulfate (Note 10), 0.4 g of quinoline, and 200 mL of anhydrous ether. The flask is attached to an atmospheric-pressure hydrogenation apparatus (Note 11) and flushed with hydrogen. Ethyl tetrolate (23.2 mL, 22.4 g, 0.2 mol) is introduced into the hydrogenation flask with a syringe, and stirring is commenced. The progress of the reaction may be monitored by the uptake of hydrogen (theoretical \u2245 4500 mL), by gas chromatography, or by removing aliquots that are concentrated and analyzed by 1H NMR, monitoring the disappearance of the methyl singlet at \u03b4 1.95; a total hydrogenation time of 10\u201315 hr is required (Note 12). After hydrogenation is complete, the catalyst is removed by filtration of the reaction mixture through a Celite pad. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator (Note 8) to obtain 21.1\u201322.4 g (93\u201398%) of ethyl isocrotonate as a light-yellow liquid. This material contains traces of quinoline but is of a purity suitable for many uses (Note 6) and (Note 13).

Nitrogen is passed through the solvent for 15 min and a constant flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the reaction. A solution of 14.06 g (0.1 mol) of (2-chloroethyl)benzene (Note 2) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is placed in the dropping funnel. About 2 mL of this solution is added to the reaction mixture and the reaction is initiated by gently heating the flask (with a heat gun). Once the reaction has started, as evidenced by the disappearance of iodine color, the rest of the (2-chloroethyl)benzene solution is added dropwise at such a rate that a gentle reflux is maintained throughout the addition. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 1 hr at 23\u00b0C, followed by heating at reflux for 8 hr. The reaction vessel is cooled to 0\u00b0C and a solution of 13.56 g (0.12 mol) of N-formylpiperidine (Note 3) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise (Note 4).

After the magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration, the solvent is removed at aspirator vacuum on a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled through a short column to give 8.8\u201310.2 g (66\u201376%) of 3-phenylpropionaldehyde, bp 87\u00b0C (1.0 mm) (Note 5),(Note 6),(Note 7)."

            "A. 4,6,6-Trimethyl-2-trimethylsiloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser (center neck), Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, ground-glass stopper, and rubber septum. The apparatus is connected, through the reflux condenser, to a nitrogen source and a bubbler (Note 1). After the flask is flushed with nitrogen, it is charged with 150 mL of dry dimethoxyethane (DME) (Note 2) and 11.25 mL (80.4 mmol) of freshly distilled diisopropylamine (Note 3). The flask is immersed in a methanol\u2013ice bath and cooled to an external temperature of \u221215\u00b0C. Over a period of about 5 min, butyllithium, 49.8 mL (79.6 mmol) (Note 4), is added, with continuous stirring, with a syringe through the septum. After an additional 15 min of stirring, 10.0 g (72.4 mmol) of freshly distilled isophorone (Note 5) is added neat over a 10-min period. The bright-yellow solution is stirred for an additional 10 min at \u221215\u00b0C. At this point, 17.5 mL (137.6 mmol) of freshly distilled chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCL) (Note 6) is rapidly introduced through the septum. After the addition is complete (ca. 20 sec), the white slurry is stirred for an additional 2 hr at room temperature. The apparatus is then dismantled, the two outside necks of the flask are stoppered with ground-glass stoppers, and the center neck is attached to a rotary evaporator. Solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is treated with 100 mL of pentane. The slurry is filtered through a sintered-glass filter and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to give 13.5\u201313.9 g (88\u201391%) of pure 4,6,6-trimethyl-2-trimethylsiloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene, bp 54\u201357\u00b0C (1.5 mm), 37\u201339\u00b0C (0.01 mm) [lit.2 bp 45\u201349\u00b0C (0.05 mm)] (Note 7).\nB. 6-Hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an adapter with a stopcock connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler (center neck), two ground-glass stoppers, and a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar (Note 1). After the system is flushed with nitrogen, the flask is charged with 300 mL of dry hexane (Note 8) and 10.0 g (47.5 mmol) of 4,6,6-trimethyl-2-trimethylsiloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. The flask is immersed in a methanol\u2013ice bath and cooled to an external temperature of \u221215\u00b0C and then, with stirring, the solution is treated with a slurry which contains 10.6 g (52.3 mmol) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) (Note 9) and 50 mL of dry hexane (Note 10). When the addition is complete (ca. 1.5 min), the resulting slurry is stirred at \u221215\u00b0C for 20 min and then at 30\u00b0C (water bath) for 2 hr. The mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass filter into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. If solid remains in the residue, 10\u201315 mL of pentane is added, filtration is repeated, and solvent is again removed under reduced pressure. The flask is fitted with a Teflon-covered stirring bar and the residue is treated with 150 mL of dry methylene chloride (Note 11) and 11.5 g (95.0 mmol) of triethylammonium fluoride (Et3NHF) (Note 12). After the solution is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, it is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (2 \u00d7 100 mL), 100 mL of 1.5 N hydrochloric acid, and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic layer is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered, and solvent is removed from the filtrate using a rotary evaporator. The residue is then freed of the last traces of solvent by pumping, with stirring, at reduced pressure (ca. 2.0 mm) (Note 13); the residue solidifies. The round-bottomed flask is attached to a short-path distillation apparatus and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. After a small forerun, the main fraction, bp 73\u201375\u00b0C (1.3 mm), is collected (Note 14). This fraction solidifies and is triturated with 3\u20135 mL of petroleum ether (bp 30\u201360\u00b0C) at \u221215\u00b0C (ice\u2013methanol) to remove traces of isophorone. When the crystalline residue is dried in a stream of nitrogen, pure 6-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one is obtained: 4.8\u20135.1 g (66\u201370%), mp 44.5\u201345\u00b0C [lit.3 mp 45\u201346\u00b0C]. The forerun and the material left in the still head after distillation are combined (Note 15) and treated with the petrolum ether that was used to triturate the main fraction. Crystallization gives an additional 0.2\u20130.3 g (3\u20134%) of the hydroxy ketone, mp 44.5\u201345\u00b0C. Thus the total weight of the 6-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one is 5.1\u20135.4 g (70\u201373%) (Note 16)."

            "Caution! Reactions using peroxides should be performed behind a safety shield to minimize explosion hazards (Note 1). Hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) and methanol are toxic and must be handled in a hood (Note 2).\nA. Oxodiperoxymolybdenum(aqua)(hexamethylphosphoric triamide), MoO5\u00b7H2O\u00b7HMPA.2 A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with an internal thermometer and a mechanical paddle stirrer. The flask is charged, with stirring, with 30 g (0.2 mol) of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) (Note 3) and 150 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Note 4). An oil bath equilibrated at 40\u00b0C is placed under the rection mixture and heating is continued until the internal temperature reaches 35\u00b0C. The heating bath is removed and replaced by a water bath to control the mildly exothermic reaction so that an internal temperature of 35\u201340\u00b0C is maintained. After the initial exothermic period (approximately 30 min), the reaction flask is placed in the 40\u00b0C oil bath and stirred a total of 3.5 hr to form a yellow solution with a small amount of suspended white solid (Note 5).\nAfter cooling to 20\u00b0C, the solution is filtered through a 1-cm mat of Celite pressed into a coarse-porosity sintered-glass filter. The yellow filtrate is cooled to 10\u00b0C (with an ice bath and magnetic stirring) and 37.3 g (0.21 mol) of hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) (Note 2) is added dropwise over 5 min, resulting in the formation of a yellow crystalline precipitate. Stirring is continued for a total of 15 min at 10\u00b0C, and the product is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel and pressed dry with a spatula. After 30 min in the funnel (aspirator vacuum), the filtercake is transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask. Methanol (20 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred in the 40\u00b0C bath. More methanol is slowly added until the crystals have dissolved. Cooling the saturated solution in the refrigerator gives yellow needles. The crystal mass is broken up with a spatula, the product is filtered and washed with 20\u201330 mL of cold methanol to give MoO5\u00b7H2O\u00b7HMPA, 46\u201350 g (59\u201364%) (Note 5) and (Note 6).\nB. Oxodiperoxymolybdenum(pyridine)(hexamethylphosphoric triamide) MoO5\u00b7Py\u00b7HMPA=MoOPH.2 The recrystallized product from above is dried over phosphorus oxide (P2O5) in a vacuum desiccator, shielded from the light, for 24 hr at 0.2 mm to give a somewhat hygroscopic yellow solid, MoO5\u00b7HMPA. A 36.0-g (0.101 mol) portion of MoO5\u00b7HMPA is dissolved in 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 7) and the solution is filtered through a Celite mat, if needed, to remove a small amount of amorphous precipitate. The filtrate is then stirred magnetically in a 20\u00b0C water bath while 8.0 g (0.101 mol) of dry pyridine (Note 8) is added over 10 min. The crystalline, yellow product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with dry tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) and anhydrous ether (200 mL) and dried in a vacuum desiccator (1 hr, 0.2 mm) to yield 36\u201338 g (51\u201353% overall from MoO3) of finely divided yellow crystalline MoO5\u00b7Py\u00b7HMPA (Note 9).\nThe product is stored in a dark glass jar inside a second container partly filled with Drierite, and the container is kept in the refrigerator. Before opening the jar, the container is allowed to warm to room temperature to avoid condensation of moisture inside. Properly stored MoOPH is a freely flowing crystalline powder and can be used over a period of several months (Note 10).\nC. Hydroxylation of camphor: 1,7,7-trimethyl-3-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.1]-heptan-2-one. A solution of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is prepared as follows: A 250-mL, three-necked flask and magnetic stirrer are flame-dried under a slow stream of nitrogen. After cooling, the flask is charged with 40 mL of approximately 1.5 M butyllithium in hexane (Note 11) under nitrogen flow using a syringe. The flask is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and 9.2 mL (66 mmol) of diisopropylamine (Note 8) is added by syringe, followed by 40 mL of dry THF (Note 7). The resulting LDA solution is allowed to reach room temperature under a slow flow of nitrogen. For titration, 0.312 g (2 mmol) of menthol is dissolved in 5 mL of dry THF with a few crystals of phenanthroline (Note 12) under nitrogen flow at \u221270\u00b0C. The LDA solution is added dropwise (using a nitrogen-purged syringe) to the stirred menthol solution until the yellow color of menthoxide\u2013phenanthroline turns to the rust color of LDA\u2013phenanthroline (2.67 mL of LDA solution is needed, 0.75 M).\nAn aliquot of 47.1 mL (35.3 mmol) of LDA solution is transferred by nitrogen-filled syringe into a nitrogen-swept, 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a device for addition of solid MoOPH. The latter is an L-shaped glass tube with male joints at each end. A round-bottomed flask containing 20.9 g (48.1 mmol) of MoOPH is wired to the L-tube, which is wired to the reaction vessel at such an angle that rotation of the L-tube causes addition of MoOPH to the enolate. The MoOPH container is temporarily suspended using clamps, and the entire apparatus is maintained under a slow flow of nitrogen. After the LDA solution is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath, 4.88 g (32.1 mmol) of camphor (Note 13) in 200 mL of dry THF is added dropwise with stirring over 0.5 hr. Then 10 min later the reaction is placed in a dry ice\u2013carbon tetrachloride bath and after 15 min the MoOPH is added over 1\u20132 min by rotating the L-tube and gently tapping it to dislodge the powder. The reaction immediately turns orange and eventually fades to a pale tan (Note 14). Stirring is continued at approximately \u221223\u00b0C for 20 min, and the reaction is quenched by adding 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). Vigorous stirring is maintained and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. After 10 min at 20\u00b0C, the mixture is shaken with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 70 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are washed once with a mixture of 50 mL of 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid and 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The hydrochloric acid\u2013sodium chloride aqueous layer is back-extracted with 50 mL of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under an aspirator to yield a blue\u2013green oil. Residual molybdenum salts are removed by filtration over 100 g of silica gel (Note 15) in a 2.5-cm column wet-packed and eluted with 1:1 ether\u2013hexane. The product is eluted with approximately 750 mL of ether\u2013hexane. Evaporation (aspirator) yields a white semisolid, which is crystallized from 15 mL of hexane at \u221220\u00b0C and collected by washing with hexane cooled to \u221270\u00b0C. The mother liquors are crystallized in a similar manner from 2-4 mL of hexane to give a total of five crops, 4.14 g (77%) of colorless needles, mp 170\u2013183\u00b0C, a 5:1 mixture of endo : exo isomers (Note 16). Recrystallization did not affect the isomer ratio (literature mp; endo, 192\u2013195\u00b0C, exo, 210\u2013211\u00b0C).3"

            "A. Potassium monomethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate ((Note 1), 264.2 g, 2.0 mol) is dissolved in anhydrous methanol ((Note 2), 1150 mL) contained in a dry, 3-L, one-necked flask containing a large magnetic stirring bar and protected from atmospheric moisture with a calcium sulfate-filled drying tube. The solution is stirred magnetically and cooled to ice-water bath temperature. Potassium hydroxide pellets (112.2 g 2.0 mol) are added rapidly to the cold solution and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring overnight. The colorless crystals of potassium monomethyl malonate that form are recovered by suction filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with anhydrous diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and diethyl ether wash are concentrated at 30\u00b0C to a volume of ca. 750 mL on a rotary evaporator. The resulting crystalline precipitate is recovered as before by filtration and washing and combined with the first crop of crystals to give 220 g (71%) of potassium monomethyl malonate as fine colorless needles, mp 204\u2013207\u00b0C. These crystals are dried under vacuum (0.1 mm) before use in the following reaction.\nB. Methyl diformylacetate. Freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride (612 g, 4 mol) is added dropwise with constant stirring at ambient temperature (Note 3) to dimethylformamide (1460 g) contained in a 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical paddle stirrer, immersion thermometer, and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a calcium chloride-filled drying tube. The reaction mixture warms up and turns to a dark reddish-brown color during addition of the phosphorus oxychloride and formation of the Vilsmeier reagent [(CH3)2N+=CHCl Cl\u2212]. The addition funnel is replaced with a 10-in. long West condenser (Note 4), and then the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C by immersing the reaction flask in an ice-salt water bath. The cooling bath is removed and potassium monomethyl malonate (206 g, 1.32 mol) is added to the stirred reaction mixture in ten equal portions over a 30 min period (Note 3) and (Note 5), keeping the temperature of the mixture below 90\u00b0C. The dark-brown mixture then is stirred and heated on a water bath at 90\u00b0C for 4 hr. Gas (CO2 plus HCl) evolves initially from the reaction on heating (Note 6). The thermometer is replaced with a glass stopper, the condenser is fixed for distillation by addition of a distilling head and vacuum distillation receiver, and the reaction solvent is removed from the flask by distillation at ca. 2 mm on a steam bath (Note 7). The resulting dark-brown liquid is poured onto ice (4 kg, (Note 3)). A saturated aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (1.3 kg) is added slowly to the ice-cold crude reaction product with constant stirring until the pH of the mixture stabilizes at ca. 1 l. Considerable foaming and gas evolution (CO2) occur during the addition of the base. The resulting basic solution is stirred magnetically at ambient temperature for 48 hr and then extracted with ethyl acetate in four 1-L portions. The organic phases are discarded, and the aqueous phase is saturated with potassium chloride (500 g) by stirring at ambient temperature until no more salt dissolves. This mixture is mixed with ice (1 kg), slowly acidified to pH 1 with ice-cold 12 N hydrochloric acid, and then thoroughly extracted with four 2-L portions of diethyl ether (Note 8). The combined cold ether extracts are washed with a saturated aqueous solution of potassium chloride (4 L) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (500 g) for 1 hr. The solution is decanted from the desiccant, combined with a 500-mL diethyl ether wash of the desiccant, concentrated under reduced pressure to ca. 500 mL, and redried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of the desiccant by gravity filtration, the diethyl ether is removed by rotary evaporation at water aspirator pressure and 25\u00b0C. Fractional distillation of the resulting liquid residue at 2 mm with a N2 bleed capillary through a Claisen head first gives a little dimethylformamide. When dimethylformamide ceases to distill (Note 9), the receiver is cooled in a dry ice\u2013ethanol bath and the methyl diformylacetate distilled at 58\u201361\u00b0C to give 86\u201394 g (50\u201355%) of a colorless, solid distillate, which melts at about 10\u00b0C (Note 10) and (Note 11). Methyl diformylacetate prepared in this way is stable for at least 6 months if stored at \u221220\u00b0C."

            "Caution! The ozonolysis reaction produces peroxidic intermediates that can present a potential explosion hazard. Accordingly, it is recommended that the following experiments be carried out in a hood and behind a safety shield.\nA. A 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a glass tube to admit ozone, a calcium chloride drying tube, a glass stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar and is charged with 6.161 g of cyclohexene (0.075 mol), 250 mL of dichloromethane, and 50 mL of methanol (Note 1). The flask is cooled to ca. \u221278\u00b0C (2-propanol\u2013dry ice), and ozone (Note 2) is bubbled through the solution with stirring. When the solution turns blue, ozone addition is stopped. Nitrogen is passed through the solution until the blue color is discharged (Note 3) and then the cold bath is removed. The drying tube and ozone inlet are replaced with a stopper and rubber septum, and 1.215 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) (10% w/w) (Note 4) is added. The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature as it stirs under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 90 min. Anhydrous sodium bicarbonate (2.147 g, 4 mol-equiv) is added to the flask and the mixture is stirred for 15 min, and then 12 mL of dimethyl sulfide (0.150 mol) (Note 5) is added. After being stirred for 12 hr, the heterogeneous mixture is concentrated to approximately 50 mL by rotary evaporation. Dichloromethane (100 mL) is added and the mixture is washed with 75 mL of water (Note 6). The aqueous layer is extracted with two more 100-mL portions of dichloromethane, and the combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of water. After extracting the aqueous layer with 100 mL of dichloromethane, the organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Short-path distillation of the crude product (Note 7) gives 8.2\u20138.4 g of 6,6-dimethoxyhexanal, 68\u201370%, bp 80\u201382\u00b0C/1.75 mm (Note 8) and (Note 9).\nB. A round-bottomed flask equipped as in Step A is charged with 6.161 g of cyclohexene (0.075 mol), 250 mL of dichloromethane, 50 mL of methanol, and 2.0 g of anhydrous sodium bicarbonate (Note 1) and (Note 10). After the apparatus is cooled to ca. \u221278\u00b0C. ozone (Note 2) is bubbled through the solution as it is stirred. Ozone addition is stopped when the solution turns blue. Nitrogen is passed through the solution until the blue color is discharged (Note 3) and then the cold bath is removed. The solution is filtered into a l-L, round-bottomed flask and 80 mL of benzene is added. The volume is reduced to approximately 50 mL by rotary evaporation (Note 11). After dilution with 225 mL of dichloromethane the flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C and 16 mL of triethylamine (0.113 mol) and 21.24 mL of acetic anhydride (0.225 mol) are added via syringe (Note 12), and the solution is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min. The ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for 4 hr. The solution is washed with 150-mL portions of aqueous 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide, and water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. Short-path distillation of the crude product yields methyl 6-oxohexanoate, (7.0\u20137.8 g, 65\u201372%), bp 83\u201386\u00b0C/1.5 mm (Note 13).\nC. Cyclohexene, 6.161 g (0.075 mol), is stirred with ozone in dichloromethane and methanol, as above. The resulting solution is treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid and subsequently neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, as described in Procedure A. The solution is filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, 80 mL of benzene is added, and the volume is reduced to approximately 50 mL by rotary evaporation (Note 11). Dilution with dichloromethane, treatment with triethylamine and acetic anhydride, and workup as described in Procedure B followed by short-path distillation provides methyl (6,6-dimethoxy)hexanoate, (11.2\u201311.8 g, 78\u201383%), bp 87\u201391\u00b0C/1.5 mm (Note 14)."

            "A. Phenyl vinyl sulfide. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with magnetic stirrer, condenser, addition funnel, and nitrogen-inlet tube is placed 400 mL of ethanol. Sodium metal (23 g, 1 g-atom), cut into small pieces, is added with stirring. When conversion to sodium ethoxide is complete (5\u201315 min), the stopper of the addition funnel is removed under a positive flow of nitrogen, and benzenethiol (110 g, 1 mol) is poured into the addition funnel. The stopper is put in place, and the benzenethiol is added over 15\u201320 min to the cloudy, gray sodium ethoxide solution. The reaction mixture warms spontaneously and becomes clear brown. At 25\u00b0C this solution is transferred by stainless-steel cannula (Note 1) over 45 min to a stirred solution of 1,2-dibromoethane (272 g, 1.45 mol) in ethanol (28 mL) contained in a 2-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, reflux condenser, nitrogen-inlet tube, and internal thermometer (Note 2). The reaction temperature is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0C by cooling with an ice bath. The mixture is stirred under nitrogen for 30 min and treated for an additional 30 min with ethanolic sodium ethoxide prepared from 40 g (2.17 g-atom) of sodium and 800 mL of ethanol (Note 3). The resulting mixture is stirred at reflux for 8 hr (Note 4), cooled, and treated with 750 mL of benzene and 750 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, washed with water (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and brine (100 mL), and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The yellow oil that results is distilled to give 70\u201387 g (50\u201365%) of phenyl vinyl sulfide, bp 91\u201393\u00b0C/20 mm (Note 5) and (Note 6).\nB. Phenyl vinyl sulfone. In a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer, condenser, addition funnel, and thermometer is placed 19.7 g(0.145 mol) of phenyl vinyl sulfide dissolved in 70 mL of glacial acetic acid. Hydrogen peroxide (30%, 56 mL, 0.5 mol) is added slowly at such a rate to maintain a reaction temperature of 70\u00b0C (Note 7). The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 20 min, cooled, and treated with ether (150 mL) and water (200 mL). The organic phase is separated, washed with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), and concentrated at 70\u00b0C/0.3 mm for 3 hr to afford 18\u201319 g (74\u201378%) of phenyl vinyl sulfone as a colorless solid, mp 64\u201365\u00b0C. Although this material is sufficiently pure for most purposes, recrystallization from hexane affords colorless crystals, mp 66\u201367\u00b0C (Note 8).\nC. Phenyl vinyl sulfoxide. A 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel and magnetic stirrer is charged with 20 g (0.147 mol) of phenyl vinyl sulfide and 250 mL of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C while a solution of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (25.4 g, 1.0 equiv) in 200 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise during a 30-min period. The mixture is stirred and warmed to room temperature for 1 hr in a water bath at 30\u00b0C. The mixture is then poured into 300 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and the mixture is extracted with three 250-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with three 250-mL portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation and the residual liquid is distilled to afford 15\u201316 g (68\u201370%) of phenyl vinyl sulfoxide as a colorless liquid, bp 98\u00b0C/0.6 mm (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

            "A. Geranial. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is dried in an oven and equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a Claisen adapter, and two pressure-equalizing dropping funnels. The flask is charged with 500 mL of dichloromethane (Note 1) and 20 mL (29.2 g, 0.23 mol) of oxalyl chloride (Note 2). The solution is stirred and cooled at \u221250 to \u221260\u00b0C as 34 mL (37.5 g, 0.48 mol) of dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 3) in 100 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise at a rapid rate. After 5 min 30.8 g (0.2 mol) of geraniol (Note 4) is added dropwise over 10 min maintaining the temperature at \u221250 to \u221260\u00b0C. After another 15 min, 140 mL of triethylamine is added dropwise while keeping the temperature at or below \u221250\u00b0C. Stirring is continued for 5 min, after which time the mixture if allowed to warm to room temperature and 700 mL of water is added. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 300-mL portions of dichloromethane. The organic layers are combined, washed with two 100-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The filtered solution is concentrated to 500 mL by rotary evaporation and washed successively with 1% hydrochloric acid until it is no longer basic. The dichloromethane solution is washed with water, 5% sodium carbonate, water, and saturated sodium chloride before drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Rotary evaporation of the solvent gives ca. 30 g of crude product. Distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus (Note 5) with an oven temperature of 80\u201385\u00b0C (1 mm) affords 27.3\u201328.5 g (90\u201394%) of geranial, nD24 1.4870 (Note 6).\nB. (E)-4,8-Dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and serum caps (Note 7) is charged with 50 g (0.12 mol) of methyltriphenylphosphonium iodide (Note 8) and 320 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 9) and is flushed with argon. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and the suspension is stirred under a positive pressure of argon, while about 0.2\u20130.6 mL of 2.05 M phenyllithium in 30 : 70 ether: cyclohexane (Note 10) and (Note 11) is added dropwise until the suspension develops a permanent yellow color (Note 12). Then 56 mL (0.115 mol) of 2.05 M phenyllithium is added dropwise over 10 min. The ice bath is removed, and the orange suspension containing excess phosphonium salt is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture is stirred and cooled at 0\u20135\u00b0C, and 17.2 g (0.11 mol) of geranial in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over 10 min. The dropping funnel is rinsed with a small amount of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The light-orange mixture is hydrolyzed by adding 2 mL of methanol, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator until a slurry results (Note 13). The slurry is diluted with 200 mL of petroleum ether (bp 60\u201368\u00b0C), and the supernatant solution is decanted and filtered through 150 g of Celite on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The solids remaining in the flask are heated with three 100-mL portions of hot petroleum ether, and the supernatant solutions are also filtered through Celite. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a yellowish liquid that is filtered through 150 g of Florisil on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and the Florisil is washed with 300 mL of petroleum ether. Rotary evaporation of the eluate provides ca. 15 g of clear liquid, which on distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus with an oven temperature of 60\u201370\u00b0C (2 mm) gives 13.1\u201313.5 g (77\u201380%) of the triene, nD22 1.4871 (Note 14) and (Note 15).\nC. Homogeraniol. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a gas inlet tube to maintain a positive argon pressure within the apparatus (Note 7). The flask is charged with 102 mL (94.8 mmol) of 0.93 M diborane in tetrahydrofuran (Note 16), and the contents are cooled to \u221230\u00b0C. The diborane solution is stirred as 22.1 mL (0.21 mol) of 2-methyl-2-butene (Note 17) is added rapidly. Stirring is continued for 2 hr while maintaining the temperature at 0\u20132\u00b0C. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a gas inlet tube to keep a positive pressure of argon (Note 7) is charged with 13.0 g (86.7 mmol) of (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and 35 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 9). The contents are stirred and cooled at 0\u00b0C as the solution of disiamylborane in the first flask is transferred via a cannula to the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached to the second flask. After approximately 20 mL of disiamylborane is transferred to the dropping funnel via a cannula, the dropwise addition of the disiamylborane is started while the transfer continues. The remainder of the disiamylborane solution in the first flask is kept at 0\u00b0C. After the 1-hr addition is completed, stirring is continued for 1 hr at 0\u00b0C and overnight at room temperature (15 hr). Excess disiamylborane is destroyed by adding 2 mL of ethanol, the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and 33 mL of 3 M sodium hydroxide is added rapidly. Stirring and cooling at \u221210\u00b0C are continued as 33 mL of chilled 30% hydrogen peroxide is slowly added (Note 18). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hr, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-mL portions of ether (Note 19). The combined organic layers are washed with two 25-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent gives ca. 21 g of crude product that is purified by chromatography on 400 g of silica gel packed in a 7.5-cm \u00d7 20-cm column. The column is eluted with dichloromethane and 100-mL fractions are collected, the first two of which are discarded. Elution is continued by collecting the 100-mL fractions in a weighed flask and evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure until a constant weight of product is obtained (nine 100-mL fractions). Distillation of the residue in a Kugelrohr apparatus with an oven temperature of 150\u00b0C (0.02 mm) gives 12.6\u201313.2 g (88\u201391%) of homogeraniol, nD21 1.4740 (Note 20)."

            "A. 3-Phenyl-4-pentenoic acid. A mixture of 33.7 g (0.25 mol) of cinnamyl alcohol (Note 1), 46.1 mL (0.25 mol) of triethyl orthoacetate (Note 1), and 0.19 mL (1.5 mmol) of hexanoic acid (Note 2) is placed in a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, Claisen head, and condenser. The solution is heated in an oil bath with distillation of ethanol. After 3 hr, distillation of ethanol slows and another 0.1-mL portion of hexanoic acid is added. Additional portions (0.1 mL) of the catalyst are added again at 3.5 and 4.5 hr. After 6 hr, a total of 27 mL of ethanol, out of a theoretical 29.2 mL, has been collected, and GC analysis (Note 3) indicates that no cinnamyl alcohol remains. Over this 6-hr period the internal temperature rises from 100 to 166\u00b0C.\nThe solution is allowed to cool, and 19.7 g (0.35 mol) of potassium hydroxide in 25 mL of water and 75 mL of methanol is added. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hr under nitrogen. After the alkaline solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, it is washed with ether and acidified with concentrated HCl. The acidic solution is extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether, and the organic layer is dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The yield of crude 3-phenyl-4-pentenoic acid is 38\u201339 g (86\u201388%). This material is essentially pure by NMR analysis and can be used directly as starting material for the following iodolactonization reactions. The acid can be further purified by crystallization from hexane (86% recovery in two crops) to give product melting at 44\u201346\u00b0C.\nB. Thermodynamically controlled formation of the trans (4RS,5SR) isomer of 4,5-dihydro-5-iodomethyl-4-phenyl-2(3H)-furanone. In a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 4) and immersed in an ice bath is placed a solution of 10 g (0.057 mol) of 3-phenyl-4-pentenoic acid in 200 mL of acetonitrile (Note 5). Solid iodine (44.5 g, 0.18 mol) (Note 6) is added, and the mixture is protected from light and stirred at 0\u00b0C under nitrogen for 24 hr. The mixture is partitioned between 100 mL of ether and 100 mL of saturated aq NaHCO3. The organic layer is washed with 10% aqueous Na2S2O3 until colorless, and with water and brine. It is then dried over MgSO4, the solvent is removed at reduced pressure, and the crude trans iodolactone is obtained as a thick oil; weight 14.5\u201315.6 g (85\u201391%). NMR analysis indicates that the trans : cis ratio is at least 95 : 5 (Note 7).\nC. Kinetically-controlled formation of the cis (4RS,5RS) isomer of 4,5-dihydro-5-iodomethyl-4-phenyl-2(3H)-furanone. A mixture of 10 g (0.057 mol) of 3-phenyl-4-pentenoic acid, 9.1 g (0.11 mol) of NaHCO3 and 200 mL of water is placed in a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 4) and stirred until a homogeneous solution is obtained. Chloroform (200 mL) is added, the mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and 28.4 g (0.112 mol) (Note 8) of iodine is added. The mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 6 hr, the layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with 10% aqueous Na2S2O3 until colorless, and with water and brine. The organic layer is dried over MgSO4, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the crude cis-iodolactone is obtained as a semisolid: weight 15.5\u201316.3 g (91\u201395%), mp 75\u201390\u00b0C (Note 9).

The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and then charged with 48.7 g (2.0 mol) of magnesium turnings and 1 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). To the stirred suspension is added dropwise 149.5 mL (218.3 g, 2.0 mol) of bromoethane over 3 hr while maintaining the temperature at 50\u00b0C or less. After complete addition, the gray\u2013green solution is heated at 50\u00b0C for 1 hr and then cooled to 5\u00b0C on ice. A solution of 41.6 mL (40.5 g, 0.72 mol) of propargyl alcohol (Note 3) in 42 mL of tetrahydrofuran is cautiously added dropwise to the gray suspension over 2.25 hr while maintaining the temperature at 10\u00b0C or less (Note 4).

The resulting solution is cooled to 5\u00b0C on ice and the addition funnel is charged with 254 mL (217 g, 2.0 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 5). This is added dropwise to the stirred solution over 1 hr while maintaining the temperature at 25\u00b0C or less by external cooling with ice. After complete addition, the mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hr with a heating mantle (Note 6). The suspension is cooled to 20\u00b0C on ice and then 800 mL of 1.4 M aqueous sulfuric acid is cautiously added over 0.75 hr so that the temperature remains below 45\u00b0C. The resulting solution is stirred for 5 min and then 600 mL of ether is added. Both phases are transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with 400-mL portions of ether and all ether layers are individually washed in series with two 1-L portions of water and once with 800 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The yellow\u2013brown residue is purified by short path distillation to afford 82\u201386 g (91\u201394% yield) of 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propyn-1-ol as a clear, colorless liquid (Note 7), bp 76\u00b0C (20 mm) (Note 8).\nB.

A 3-L, three-necked flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with needle valve, and a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen gas inlet tube that is attached to a mineral oil bubbler. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and while the system is maintained under a static pressure of nitrogen, the flask is charged with 1000 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 1) and 96.5 g (0.86 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 2). Freshly distilled 2-acetylpyridine (50.0 g, 0.41 mol) (Note 3) is then added dropwise over a period of 5\u201310 min (Note 4). To the resulting reaction mixture 32.7 g (0.43 mol) of carbon disulfide is added over a period of 30\u201335 min. After the addition is completed, 122.1 g (0.86 mol) of methyl iodide is added over 1 hr to the viscous, heterogeneous orange reaction mixture. After the tan reaction mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature, it is poured into 2 L of iced water and allowed to stand for 4 hr.

A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a gas inlet tube is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 22.4 g (0.20 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide. Freshly distilled 2-acetylpyridine (12.1 g, 0.10 mol) (Note 3) is added, the solution is stirred for 10 min, and 22.5 g (0.1 mol) of 3,3-bis(methylthio)-1-(2-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one is then added. The mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature, during which time it turns bright red and a red solid precipitates (Note 7). The mixture is next treated with 77 g (1.0 mol) of ammonium acetate and 250 mL of glacial acetic acid. A distillation head fitted with a thermometer is attached to the flask and the tetrahydrofuran is removed by distillation over a 2-hr period. The residual brown solution is chilled to 15\u00b0C, treated with 400 g of ice, and allowed to stand for 3 hr. Water (400 mL) is added, the mixture is chilled to 15\u00b0C, and the gray material that precipitates is collected by filtration, washed with iced water (3 \u00d7 200 mL), and air-dried. The crude product is taken up in 250 mL of boiling ethanol and filtered. The filtercake is rinsed with 50 mL of hot ethanol, and the hot filtrates are combined, diluted with 150 mL of water, concentrated to a volume of 400 mL, and allowed to cool to room temperature. After the mixture is thoroughly chilled in an ice bath, the precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with 50% aqueous ethanol, and dried under reduced pressure (23\u00b0C, 0.1 mm) to give 20.6\u201321.4 g (74\u201377%) of 4'-(methylthio)-2,2' : 6',2''-terpyridine as gray needles, mp 118\u2013119\u00b0C (Note 8).

The resultant green heterogeneous mixture is chilled in an ice bath while the system is maintained under a static pressure of nitrogen. To this chilled (0\u20135\u00b0C) mixture, a solution of 20.4 g (0.54 mol) of sodium borohydride in 128 mL of 40% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added dropwise over 4 hr (Note 10). After the addition is completed and the evolution of hydrogen subsides, the dark reaction mixture is refluxed for 12 hr. The hot mixture is then filtered through a Celite pad, and the pad is washed with hot ethanol (3 \u00d7 100 mL).

            "Caution! Part A should be conducted in an efficient fume hood to avoid exposure to sulfur dioxide generated in the reaction. Benzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards for its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA. (S)-( \u2212 )-Menthyl p-toluenesulfinate. In a dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet are placed a magnetic stirring bar and 65 g (40 mL, 0.55 mol) of thionyl chloride (Note 1). The liquid is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere as 35.6 g (0.200 mol) of anhydrous sodium p-toluenesulfinate (Note 2) is added in portions over about 1 hr (Note 3). The solution immediately develops a yellow-green tinge as sulfur dioxide is liberated. After about three-fourths of the sulfinate has been added, 30 mL of benzene is added to facilitate stirring. The greenish slurry is stirred for another 1.5 hr, after which time 75 mL of benzene is added. The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, along with 75 mL of benzene used to rinse the flask. Excess thionyl chloride and benzene are removed by rotary evaporation and gentle heating. Four 150-mL portions of benzene are added to the residue, and each portion is evaporated to complete the removal of the thionyl chloride. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The crude p-toluenesulfinyl chloride, sodium chloride, and residual benzene are dissolved in 150 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. The resulting ethereal suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath as 31.3 g (0.200 mol) of ( \u2212 )-menthol (Note 1) in 25 mL of pyridine is added over ca. 2 min. The mixture is allowed to stir overnight, after which 70 g of ice is added. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with one 100-mL portion of ether. The ethereal solutions are combined, washed three times with 50-mL portions of 20% aqueous hydrochloric acid, and dried with a mixture of anhydrous sodium sulfate and potassium carbonate. Filtration to separate the drying agents and rotary evaporation until a pressure of 3 mm is sustained leaves 57.5 g of crude methyl p-toluenesulfinate as a clear liquid admixed with white crystals. The less soluble (S)-( \u2212 ) diastereomer (1) is isolated in several crops by crystallization from 1.2 volumes of reagent-grade acetone at \u221220\u00b0C. After the first crop has been collected, 3 drops of concd hydrochloric acid is added to the acetone mother liquor to effect equilibration of the sulfinate diastereomers. A total of 40.9\u201342.2 g of crystalline sulfinate is obtained in six crops. Recrystallization from acetone affords two crops of (S)-( \u2212 )-methyl p-toluenesulfinate, mp 105\u2013106\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 \u2212199.4 (acetone, c 1.5), weighing 36.9\u201338.2 g (63\u201365%) (Note 4).\nB. (S)-( + )-2-(p-Toluenesulfinyl)-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two rubber septa, a nitrogen inlet, 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is flame-dried under nitrogen. After the apparatus cools to room temperature, the flask is charged with 70 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 5) and cooled in an isopropyl alcohol\u2013dry ice bath. Stirring is begun as 42 mL (60.8 mmol) of 1.45 M butyllithium in hexane (Note 6) is added slowly through the dropping funnel over 10\u201330 min. After another 10 min. a solution of 11.3 g (55.1 mmol) of 2-bromo-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal (Note 7) is added from the dropping funnel over 30 min. The colorless or pale-yellow solution is stirred and cooled at \u221278\u00b0C for 1.5 hr. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two rubber septa, and a stopcock connected to a bubbler gas exit is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 24.4 g (82.9 mmol) of (S)-( \u2212 )-menthyl p-toluenesulfinate and 460 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The sulfinate suspension is stirred vigorously (Note 8) and cooled at \u221278\u00b0C as the vinyllithium reagent (2) in the first flask in then transferred into the second flask through a cooled cannula by means of nitrogen pressure (Note 9). As the 50-min transfer proceeds, the sulfinate suspension becomes yellow. The mixture is stirred for another 15 min at \u221278\u00b0C, the cooling bath is removed, and 125 mL of saturated aqueous sodium dihydrogen phosphate is added. When the contents have warmed to room temperature, the tetrahydrofuran is removed by rotary evaporation. The residue is partitioned between 300 mL of water and 200 mL of chloroform. The aqueous layer extracted with three 100-mL portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Filtration of the drying agent and evaporation of the chloroform gives 40\u201355 g of a viscous brown oil consisting of the sulfinyl ketal, menthol, menthyl sulfinate, minor by-products, and residual chloroform. The sulfinyl ketal is isolated by modified flash chromatography on 500 g of Woelm silica gel (32\u201364 \u03bcm) packed in dry diethyl ether in a 6.5-cm \u00d7 45-cm column (Note 10). The crude product is applied to the column in 25 mL of chloroform and the column is eluted with ether under sufficient compressed air pressure to achieve a flow of 60 mL per min. After thirty 60-mL fractions are collected, the solvent is changed to ethyl acetate, and another forty 60-mL fractions are collected and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Note 11). Combination and evaporation of fractions 40\u201360 provides 9.05\u20139.75 g (62\u201367%) of crude (S)-( + )-2-(p-toluenesulfinyl)-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal as a pale-yellow oil, [\u03b1]D25 +78\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 0.25) (Note 12).\nC. (S)-( + )-2-(p-Toluenesulfinyl)-2-cyclopentenone. A magnetic stirring bar, 100 g of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, and a solution of 9.05\u20139.75 g of the sulfinyl ketal in 300 mL of acetone are placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and stoppered. The suspension is stirred vigorously overnight, the copper sulfate is separated by filtration, and the filtercake is washed thoroughly with 500\u2013700 mL of acetone. Concentration of the combined filtrates by rotary evaporation gives 7.36\u20137.58 g of tan crystals. Recrystallization is carried out by dissolving the product in a minimum volume of ethyl acetate (ca. 80 mL) at room temperature, treating with Norite, diluting with an equal volume of diethyl ether, and cooling to \u221220\u00b0C. After the resulting crystals are collected, the mother liquor is evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and the procedure is repeated twice. The mother liquor is again evaporated and the residue (1.4\u20131.8 g) is purified by flash chromatography on 110 g of Woelm silica gel using ethyl acetate as eluant (Note 13). Combination of appropriate fractions, evaporation, and recrystallization affords two additional crops of crystalline product (0.4\u20130.7 g). The yield of (S)-( + )-2-(p-toluenesulfinyl)-2-cyclopentenone, mp 125\u2013126\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 + 148\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 0.11), is 6.02\u20136.60 g (50\u201354% based on bromo ketal) (Note 14) and (Note 15)."

            "Caution! Diazo compounds are presumed to be highly toxic and potentially explosive. All manipulations should be carried out in a hood. Although in numerous preparations we have never observed an explosion, all pyrolyses and distillations should routinely be carried out behind a safety shield.\nA. Benzaldehyde tosylhydrazone. A 14.6-g sample (0.078 mol) of p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide (Note 1) was placed in a 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask and 25 mL of absolute methanol was added. The slurry was swirled as 7.50 g (0.071 mol) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde was added rapidly. A mildly exothermic reaction ensued and the p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide dissolved. Within a few minutes, the tosylhydrazone began to crystallize. After 15 min the mixture was cooled in an ice bath. The product was collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with a small amount of cold methanol, and dried under an aspirator vacuum. The dry benzaldehyde tosylhydrazone, mp 124\u2013125\u00b0C, weighed 16.97\u201318.19 g (87\u201393%) and was not purified further.\nB. Phenyldiazomethane (Vacuum pyrolysis method). In a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is placed 13.71 g (0.05 mol) of benzaldehyde tosylhydrazone. A 1.0 M solution (51 mL) of sodium methoxide in methanol (0.051 mol) (Note 2) is added via syringe and the mixture is swirled until dissolution is complete (Note 3). The methanol is then removed by a rotary evaporator. The last traces of methanol are removed by evacuation of the flask at 0.1 mm for 2 hr. The solid tosylhydrazone salt is broken up with a spatula and the flask is fitted with a vacuum take-off adapter and a 50-mL receiver flask. The system is evacuated at 0.1 mm and the receiver flask is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath to about \u221250\u00b0C. The flask containing the salt is immersed in an oil bath and the temperature is raised to 90\u00b0C. (We recommend the use of a safety shield.) At this temperature, red phenyldiazomethane first begins to collect in the receiver flask. The temperature is raised to 220\u00b0C over a 1-hr period (Note 4). During this time red phenyldiazomethane collects in the receiver flask (Note 5). The pressure increases to 0.35 mm over the course of the pyrolysis. On completion of the pyrolysis the pressure drops to less than 0.1 mm.\nThe apparatus is disconnected and the 50-mL receiver flask that contains the crude phenyldiazomethane is fitted with a water-cooled short-path distillation head and a receiver flask cooled to about \u221250\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. The pressure is lowered to 1.5 mm and a trace of methanol collects in the receiver. A new receiver flask is connected and cooled to \u221250\u00b0C and the pressure is lowered to less than 0.2 mm. Red phenyldiazomethane distills below room temperature (Note 6). The yield of phenyldiazomethane, which is a liquid above \u221230\u00b0C, is 4.50\u20134.70 g (76\u201380%). The product should be used immediately or stored at a low temperature (\u221220 to \u221280\u00b0C) under nitrogen or argon (Note 7),(Note 8),(Note 9),(Note 10),(Note 11); it is explosive at room temperature."

A 1-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a condenser equipped with a two-way stopcock leading to a balloon of argon gas. To the flask is added a solution of 18.4 g of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1-butanone (Note 1) in 60 mL of dry methylene chloride. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and 28.5 g of triethylamine, a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, and 20 mL of methylene chloride are added. A solution of 25.8 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride (Note 2) in 40 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise over a period of 15 min, and the mixture is stirred for 2.5 hr.\nThe ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 21 hr at room temperature (about 30\u00b0C). Under vigorous stirring, 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, 100 mL of water, and 300 mL of ether are added to the mixture.

The flask is placed in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath and anhydrous ammonia (Note 6) is condensed into the flask (400 mL). A small piece of potassium metal (ca. 0.5 g) is added to the liquid ammonia and the cooling bath is removed. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.1 g) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature, at which time the deep blue color turns to gray. The remaining potassium metal (12.2 g, 0.31 g-atom total) is added in 0.5-g pieces over ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until a gray suspension results (20\u201330 min).

This solution is added dropwise to the solution of freshly generated potassium amide over 15 min while the temperature is maintained at \u221250\u00b0C (Note 7). After the solution is stirred for 3 hr at \u221250\u00b0 to \u221260\u00b0C, solid ammonium chloride is added slowly to quench the excess potassium amide (Note 8). The cooling bath is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During the course of the evaporation, anhydrous ether (350 mL total) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace the ammonia. After the temperature has reached 0\u00b0C, the brown reaction mixture is filtered by suction through a coarse fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts and the salts are washed twice with 25 mL of anhydrous ether.

A 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, nitrogen inlet tube, and bubbler is charged with acetone (90 mL) and copper(I) chloride (5 g, 51 mmol) (Note 1). After the flask is purged with nitrogen, the mixture is stirred and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) (2.5 mL, 16.6 mmol) (Note 2) is added. Stirring is maintained for 30 min, and the solid material is then allowed to settle, leaving a clear deep-blue-green solution of the CuCl\u2013TMEDA catalyst that is used in the oxidative coupling reaction.\nB. 1,4-Bis(trimethylsilyl)buta-1,3-diyne (BTMSBD). A 1-L, four-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 3), a dry-ice cold-finger condenser (Note 4), sintered gas inlet, and a swan-neck adapter that supports a thermometer and a rubber septum is charged with acetone (300 mL) and trimethylsilylacetylene (50 g, 0.51 mmol) (Note 5). The reaction mixture is agitated and a rapid stream of oxygen is passed through the solution (Note 6). The supernatant solution containing the CuCl\u2013TMEDA catalyst is transferred by syringe in 5-mL portions into the reaction vessel. The temperature rises as the catalyst is added and should have reached 35\u00b0C after about 75% of the catalyst has been added. When this temperature is reached, external ice cooling is applied to moderate the exothermic reaction (Note 7). The remaining catalyst is added and the temperature is maintained in the range of 25\u201330\u00b0C for 2.5 hr (Note 8). When the reaction is complete, there should be no evidence of trimethylsilylacetylene condensing on the cold trap. Agitation and oxygenation are then stopped.\nThe acetone is removed by evaporation with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is dissolved in petroleum ether (bp 30\u201340\u00b0C, 150 mL) (Note 9) and shaken in a separatory funnel with 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (150 mL). The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is washed with petroleum ether (bp 30\u201340\u00b0C, 3 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (50 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator. The solid residue is dissolved in hot methanol (400 mL) to which has been added 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 mL). The solution may be filtered at this stage if it is necessary to remove colored insoluble impurities. Water is then added dropwise until recrystallized material is permanently present. The solution is allowed to cool, finally in ice, and crystalline bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne (BTMSBD) is collected. The material is washed with a small portion of ice-cold methanol\u2013water (50 : 50 v/v; 50 mL), and air-dried to give bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne (31\u201335 g, 68\u201376%), mp 111\u2013112\u00b0C (lit.2,3 107\u2013108\u00b0C) (Note 10).

            "A. Butylmagnesium chloride. A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 1), a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a reflux condenser to the top of which is attached a T-piece connected at one end to a supply of dry nitrogen, and at the other to an oil or mercury bubbler. At the same time a dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and two swan-neck adapters, is prepared, with one adapter holding a gas inlet and a calcium chloride drying tube, and the other supporting a thermometer and a 1-L pressure-equalizing dropping funnel.\nThe 1-L flask is charged with magnesium turnings (39.6 g, 1.65 g-atom) (Note 2) and dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL). The mixture is heated to reflux temperature under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, and a crystal of iodine is added. The dropping funnel is filled with 1-chlorobutane (173 mL, 152.5 g, 1.65 mol) (Note 3) and a portion (15 mL) is added to the boiling THF mixture. The source of heat is removed. After the reaction has commenced, the THF begins to boil more vigorously and a further volume (400 mL) of THF is added to the reaction mixture. Then the remainder of the chlorobutane is added slowly at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction under reflux. Finally, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux until all the magnesium has been consumed (0.5\u20131 hr).\nB. Ethynylmagnesium chloride. While the butylmagnesium chloride is being prepared, the 2-L flask is filled with dry THF (500 mL), which is saturated by bubbling acetylene through it for 0.5\u20131 hr (Note 4). The warm (ca. 60\u00b0C) butylmagnesium chloride is rapidly poured under a liberal blanket of nitrogen into the 1-L dropping funnel, which is then flushed with nitrogen before being stoppered. The rapid flow of acetylene is maintained. The 2-L flask is cooled to \u22125\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath, the acetylene is bubbled rapidly through the THF (Note 4), and the butylmagnesium chloride is added dropwise to the stirred reaction mixture at a rate sufficient to maintain the temperature below 20\u00b0C (Note 5). This addition requires 1 hr; then acetylene is bubbled through the reaction mixture for a further 0.5 hr. (The mixture cools to about 5\u00b0C during this period.) The acetylene supply is disconnected and replaced by dry nitrogen.\nC. Trimethylsilylacetylene. A solution of chlorotrimethylsilane (152 mL, 130 g, 1.197 mol) (Note 6) in dry THF (100 mL) is placed in the 1-L dropping funnel and is added (20 min) to the cooled and stirred solution of ethynylmagnesium chloride at a rate sufficient to maintain a reaction temperature of about 15\u201320\u00b0C (Note 7). Finally, the dropping funnel is replaced by an efficient double-surface condenser and calcium chloride drying tube, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hr (Note 8). The reflux condenser is replaced by a distillation head and a double surface condenser is connected to a receiver flask which is cooled in an ice bath (Note 9). The reaction mixture is distilled under nitrogen with stirring until all the azeotrope of trimethylsilylacetylene and THF (700\u2013800 mL, bp ca. 66\u00b0C) has distilled (Note 10) and (Note 11). The distillate is washed with ice\u2013water portions (10 \u00d7 500 mL) to remove the THF. Washing is continued until the organic layer stays constant in volume (Note 12). Distillation (Note 10) of the organic layer under an atmosphere of nitrogen through a short Vigreux column (Note 13) gives trimethylsilylacetylene, bp 50\u201352\u00b0C/760mm, nD20 1.391; (lit.2,3,4 53.5\u00b0C at 762 mm, nD20 1.3900; 52\u00b0C at 760 mm, nD20 1.3900; 52\u00b0C at 760 mm, nD20 1.3935) in yields ranging from 72.5 g (62%) to 87.5 g (75%) (Note 14) and (Note 15)."

            "A. (1) Preparation of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane. (See (Note 1).) To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with two inlet tubes (with sintered-glass diffusers at the end) connected to a chlorine cylinder, and a reflux condenser connected to an outlet tube immersed in a potassium hydroxide solution, are added 1200 g (13.64 mol) of anhydrous dioxane (free of peroxides!) and 8 g (0.03 mol) of iodine. A stream of chlorine is passed through the dioxane/iodine solution heated at 90\u00b0C, and the reaction is monitored by NMR spectroscopy. After 9 hr, the conversion is 50% complete (Note 2); after 33 hr, about 90% complete. At this point, the stream of chlorine is interrupted. Reinitiation of the chlorine stream after some hours (next morning, for example) may be dangerous because it was observed in one case the mixture inflamed spontaneously! The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, 500 mL of ether is added, and the solution is washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution. The organic layer is separated, dried over sodium sulfate, the ether is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column, to yield 1200\u20131300 g of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane, bp 89\u00b0C/16 mm (lit.1 bp 82.5\u00b0C/14 mm; mp 31\u00b0C) (Note 3).\n(2) 2,3-Di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane. To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected from moisture by a drying tube, and an inlet tube for dry nitrogen, are added 103.6 g (0.66 mol) of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane, 979.1 g (13.23 mol) of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol (distilled from CaH2), and 365.1 g (2.64 mol) of potassium carbonate (ground with a mortar and pestle and activated at 250\u00b0C for 3 hr) (Note 4). The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated under reflux for 24\u201330 hr, the progress of the reaction being monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Once the singlet at \u03b4 5.95, corresponding to the methine protons of the starting material, has completely disappeared, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and poured into 500 mL of ether, and enough water (750\u2013850 mL) is added to dissolve all of the inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 128\u2013147 g of an oily residue (Note 5). Hexane (250 mL) is added and the solution is allowed to stand in a refrigerator. The resulting crystals are separated by suction filtration and washed thoroughly with 150\u2013250 mL of hexane. The residue of 3\u20136 g of crystalline product, mp 106\u2013107\u00b0C, which remains insoluble, is identified as trans-2-tert-butoxy-3-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane (Note 6). The filtrate (which contains approximately a 25 : 75 mixture of cis and trans isomers) is evaporated under reduced pressure to one-half its volume and is cooled to 0\u00b0C. Massive crystals appear, which are collected by suction filtration. The crystallization process is repeated once more to give 40\u201360 g of trans-2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane, mp 64\u201365\u00b0C. The hexane solution is evaporated under reduced pressure and the oily residue distilled at 50\u201357\u00b0C/0.25 mm to give 54\u201384 g of a mixture of cis- and trans-2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane (115\u2013124 g combined; 75\u201381% yield) (Note 7).\nB. 1,2-Di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane. To a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel protected from moisture by a drying tube, and a magnetic stirring bar, are added 43.2 g (0.21 mol) of phosphorus pentachloride and 50 mL of hexane, and the flask is cooled with an ice\u2013salt bath. While the solution is stirred, a solution of 30 g (0.13 mol) of 2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane in 100 mL of hexane is added dropwise. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 90\u2013180 min until no starting material is observed in the NMR spectrum of a sample (Note 8); the reaction mixture is then filtered through a sintered-glass filter to remove excess phosphorus pentachloride. The resulting hexane solution (~ 200 mL), which contains 1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane, 2-chloroethyl dichlorophosphate, 1,2-dichloroethane, phosphorus oxychloride, and traces of phosphorus pentachloride, is transferred into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a dry-ice condenser protected from moisture by a potassium hydroxide tube, and a short inlet tube connected to an ammonia cylinder. The reaction flask is cooled with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and, while the solution is stirred (Note 9), a fast stream of gaseous ammonia is introduced. A vigorous reaction takes place and a copious white precipitate forms. The stream of gaseous ammonia is continued for 15\u201360 min (Note 10). The cooling bath and condenser are removed, the reaction flask is connected to an ordinary aspirator line through a potassium hydroxide drying trap, and the ammonia is evaporated under aspirator vacuum with efficient stirring. The ammonia-free solution is filtered through a sintered-glass filter and the precipitate is washed with hexane. The resulting hexane solution (400\u2013500 mL), which contains 25\u201326 g (0.12 mol) of pure 1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane, is suitable for the next operation (yields, calculated from an aliquot, are 95\u201397%) (Note 11).\nC. (E)-1,2-Di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene. The solution prepared above is placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Liebig condenser (protected from moisture by a drying tube) and cooled with an ice bath; 28.9 g (0.258 mol) of solid potassium tert-butoxide is added in small portions through the condenser over a 30-min period. After addition, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 90\u2013120 min until no more starting material is detected in the 1H NMR spectrum of a sample; enough ice water is then added to just dissolve all the inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with hexane (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined hexane extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at aspirator vacuum. The residue is distilled at 40\u00b0C/0.2 mm, with the collection flask at \u221278\u00b0C, to give a center cut of (E)-1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene (15.4\u201317.0 g, 58\u201363% yield from 2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane) (Note 12) and (Note 13).\nD. Di-tert-butoxyethyne. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (Note 14), a dry-ice condenser protected from moisture by a potassium hydroxide tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, 0.5 mol of sodium amide is prepared in 500 mL of liquid ammonia (Note 15), and 20 g (0.0968 mol) of (E)-1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene dissolved in 150 mL of anhydrous ether is added in a 5-min period with efficient stirring. After the addition, stirring is continued for 80 min. The reaction mixture is diluted with 200 mL of cold pentane (\u221220 to \u221230\u00b0C), and 400 mL of cold water is added very cautiously. The organic layer is washed with 50 mL of a 0.1 M buffered phosphate solution (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 16), filtered, and concentrated at aspirator vacuum without heating to give 10\u201312 g (78\u201386% yield) of di-tert-butoxyethyne as a pale-yellow oil. The product is sufficiently pure for further reactions (Note 17), but it may be distilled at 30\u00b0C/0.05 mm; freezing point 8.5\u00b0C."

The mixture is diluted with 300 mL of pentane and a slurry of 150 g of sodium bicarbonate in 80 mL of water is added cautiously (Note 8) over 1 hr. The clear organic solution is poured of into a 1.5-L Erlenmeyer flask and the residue is washed 3 times with 50-mL portions of pentane. The combined organic solutions are dried over a mixture of 100 g of sodium sulfate and 20 g of sodium bicarbonate (Note 9) and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (No. 2), and the solid desiccant is thoroughly washed with pentane. The solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure by flash distillation through a column (40 \u00d7 2.5 cm) packed with glass helices. The liquid residue is distilled (Note 10) to give the methylenated product as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 105\u2013107\u00b0C at 90 mm, 13.6 g, 89% yield (Note 11), nD24 1.45321, [\u03b1]D23 +7.7 to +8.6\u00b0 [CHCl3, c 4.0]."

            "A. Bromomethanesulfonyl bromide. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 100 g (0.73 mol) of sym-trithiane (Note 1) suspended in 600 mL of water. Bromine (1136 g, 7.1 mol) is added with stirring while keeping the flask temperature around 40\u00b0C (Note 2). After the addition of half of the bromine, 600 mL of water is added and bromine addition is continued. After all of the bromine has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.25 hr. The mixture is transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel, the lower organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-mL portions of methylene chloride (Note 3). The organic extracts are combined, washed with one 100-mL portion of cold 5% sodium bisulfite solution and with 100 mL of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at room temperature with a rotary evaporator to a light-yellow oil. Distillation using a short Vigreux column affords 218\u2013249 g (42\u201348%) of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide as a light-yellow oil, bp 68\u201369\u00b0C (0.55 mm) (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nB. 1-Bromo-1-methyl-2-(bromomethylsulfonyl)cyclohexane. Four Pyrex test tubes (2.5 \u00d7 20 cm) are charged with 1-methylcyclohexene (5.0 g per test tube; total weight 20.0 g, 0.21 mol) (Note 6). Methylene chloride (12 mL) is added to each test tube, which is cooled in ice. An ice-cold solution of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide (13.6 g of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide per test tube; total weight 54.4 g, 0.23 mol) in methylene chloride (12 mL) is added to each test tube with mixing at 0\u00b0C (Note 7). The test tubes are attached with the help of several rubber bands to a Pyrex immersion well equipped with a 45-W mercury lamp (Note 8). The immersion well is cooled by circulation of ice water (Note 9) and immersed in a cooling bath maintained at \u221215\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is irradiated for 2 hr. Solid potassium carbonate (1.5 g) is added to each test tube and the contents of the test tubes are filtered through a small column with a glass wool plug into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask. Methylene chloride is removed, first on a rotary evaporator and then with a vacuum pump (1 mm), to give an oil that gradually solidifies (68.3 g, 98%). Recrystallization from 95% ethanol (100 mL) gives white crystals (54.3 g, 78%) (Note 10), mp 59\u201361\u00b0C (Note 11).\nC. 1,2-Dimethylenecyclohexane. An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a stopper is charged with potassium tert-butoxide (59.5 g, 0.53 mol) (Note 12) dissolved in tert-butyl alcohol\u2013tetrahydrofuran (9:1, 400 mL total) (Note 13) and cooled in ice. A solution of 1-bromo-1-methyl-2-(bromomethylsulfonyl)cyclohexane (54.0 g, 0.16 mol) in tert-butyl alcohol\u2013tetrahydrofuran (9:1, 100 mL) (Note 14) is added dropwise over a 1-hr period. After the addition is complete the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hr and then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of water. This solution is extracted with two 150-mL portions of pentane. The combined pentane extracts are washed 8 times with water (500 mL) (Note 15), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure using an efficient Vigreux column and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 11.4 g (65%) of 1,2-dimethylenecyclohexane as a colorless liquid, bp 69\u201370\u00b0 (90 mm) (lit.2 60\u201361\u00b0C, 90 mm) (Note 16) and (Note 17)."

            "A. Methyl 2-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylate. A dry, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask with a side arm containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a septum and a three-way stopcock equipped with an argon-filled balloon (Note 1). The air in the flask is replaced with argon (Note 2). Tetrahydrofuran (100 mL, (Note 3)) and diisopropylamine (4.7 g, 46 mmol, (Note 4)) are introduced into the flask through the septum using dry syringes (Note 5). The flask is immersed in an ice\u2013water bath and a 2.8 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (17 mL, 46 mmol, (Note 6)) is added to the stirred solution using a syringe (10 min). The yellow solution is allowed to stir at 0\u00b0C for an additional 15 min. The resulting solution containing lithium diisopropylamide is immersed in a dry ice\u20132-propanol bath (\u221278\u00b0C) and a solution of cyclohexanone (3.74 g, 38.1 mmol, (Note 7)) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) is added using a syringe (30 min). The reaction is allowed to warm slowly to \u22125\u00b0C over 1.75 hr. The resulting solution containing the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone is recooled to \u221230 to \u221225\u00b0C and a solution of dimethyl methoxymethylenemalonate (8.1 g, 46 mmol, (Note 8)) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) is added using a syringe (15 min). The reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 3.5 hr (Note 9). The reddish-orange solution is poured slowly onto aqueous 5% hyrochloric acid (300 mL) and the resulting yellow solution is extracted with methylene chloride (4 \u00d7 80 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to approximately 15 mL. The solution is applied to a medium pressure liquid chromatography column (25 \u00d7 500 mm, (Note 10)) packed with silica gel and 30% ethyl acetate-hexane. The eluant (30% ethyl acetate\u2013hexane) is passed through the column at a rate of 20 mL/min; 20-mL fractions are collected (Note 11). The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on analytical silica gel plates containing UV indicator (ethyl ether eluant). The fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4.9 g (62%, 62\u201368%) of methyl 2-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylate as a white solid: mp 107\u2013108\u00b0C (ethyl acetate\u2013hexane, (Note 12)).\nB. 6-Methoxy-7-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. 1,1-Dimethoxyethylene (1.1 g, 12.5 mmol, (Note 13)) is added to a solution of methyl 2-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylate (507 mg, 2.44 mmol) in dry toluene (2.5 mL, (Note 14)) in a dry, 11 \u00d7 13-mm, resealable glass tube (Note 15). The tube is flushed with argon and sealed with a Teflon plug. The reaction is warmed at 110\u00b0C in an oil bath for 15 hr (Note 16). The reaction is cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the product is effected by gravity chromatography on a 1.5 \u00d7 16-cm column of silica gel (30% ethyl ether\u2013hexane eluant) collecting 5-mL fractions (Note 17). The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (50% ethyl ether\u2013hexane eluant) and those containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 451 mg (84%, 84\u201386%) of 6-methoxy-7-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene as a white solid: mp 98.5\u201399.5\u00b0C (methanol\u2013water, (Note 18))."

The vessel is purged with nitrogen and charged with 40.0 g (0.16 mol) of 6-bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (6-bromoveratraldehyde) (Note 1). 22.4 mL (0.20 mol) of cyclohexylamine (Note 2), and 800 mL of toluene. The mixture is refluxed for 16 hr (Note 3). The solution is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual crystalline mass is recrystallized from a 3 : 1 hexane\u2013methylene chloride mixture (1.5 L) to provide 48.4\u201351.4 g of the imine 1 as white crystals in two crops (mp 172\u2013172.5\u00b0C)2 (Note 4).\nB. Cuprous iodide-triethyl phosphite complex (2). (Note 5). A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser is flame-dried under nitrogen. The vessel is charged with 38.2 g (0.20mol) of cuprous iodide, 33.4 mL (0.20 mol) of triethyl phosphite (Note 6) and 400 mL of dry toluene (distilled from CaH2). The mixture is stirred at 80\u00b0C for 8 hr, cooled to room temperature, and filtered under reduced pressure on a pad of Celite. The solvent is removed from the filtrate successively with a rotary evaporator and briefly (15 min) under high vacuum. The residual solid is recrystallized from ether (25 mL) to yield 41.1\u201349.9 g (57.4\u201369.8%) of cuprous iodidetriethyl phosphite complex in two crops, mp 114\u2013115\u00b0C.\nC. 6-Iodo-3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde cyclohexylimine (3). A 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter (Note 7), a Trubore stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, and glass stoppers. The flask is thoroughly flame-dried under nitrogen. To the cooled flask is added 14.0 g (0.043 mol) of cyclohexylimine 1 and the glass stoppers are replaced by an alcohol thermometer and a rubber septum. Tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) (Note 8) is added via syringe through the septum and the resultant mixture is stirred at room temperature (27\u00b0C) for 30 min to effect solution. The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in dry ice\u2013acetone bath (Note 9). A solution of butyllithium in hexane (30.9 mL, 1.53 M, 0.047 mol) (Note 10) is added by syringe over 10 min at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below \u221275\u00b0C (Note 11). As the butyllithium is added the precipitate slowly dissolves, leaving a clear, golden-yellow solution that is stirred for 15 min after the addition is complete. A solution of 27.0 g (0.11 mol) of iodine dissolved in 50 mL of dry THF is added via syringe to the reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below \u221270\u00b0C. The iodine solution (20\u201325 mL) is added until the red iodine color persists; precipitation also occurs. The mixture is warmed to room temperature, poured into 400 mL of water, and extracted with methylene chloride (5 \u00d7 400 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried (anhydrous MgSO4), filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to 200 mL, and then washed with 200 mL of aqueous saturated sodium sulfite solution. The organic phase is redried, filtered, and concentrated. The solid residue is recrystallized from a 1:4 chloroform\u2013hexane mixture (300 mL) to afford 12.6\u201313.5 g (78.6\u201385.0%) of 6-iodoveratraldehyde cyclohexylimine as white crystals, mp 180\u2013181\u00b0C2 (Note 4).\nD. 4,5,4',5'-Tetramethoxy-1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'-carboxaldehyde (4). The metalation procedure described in Section C is repeated using a 3-L flask, 18.4 g (0.056 mol) of 6-bromoveratraldehyde cyclohexylimine (1), 575 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 40.6 mL (1.53 M, 0.062 mol) of butyllithium. After the metalation is complete at \u221278\u00b0C, the septum is replaced by a glass stopper. Solid cuprous iodide\u2013triethyl phosphite complex (30.3 g, 0.085 mol) is added to the vessel at \u221278\u00b0C in one portion, immediately giving a green solution. The mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min. After the first 15 min, the solution turns a brownish-orange to red color. Solid 6-iodoveratraldehyde cyclohexylimine (3) (21.0 g, 0.056 mol) is added in one portion to produce an orange suspension. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (27\u00b0C), during which time the mixture becomes dark brown. The reaction mixture is stirred for 18 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is diluted with 600 mL of methylene chloride and 850 mL of 15% aqueous acetic acid and stirred vigorously for 17 hr. The yellow solution is transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The organic layer is dried (anhydrous magnesium sulfate), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to 800 mL and then transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The organic solution is washed with 5% aqueous hydrochloric acid (5 \u00d7 100 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (10 \u00d7 50 mL).\n(Caution: The final washings must be alkaline to avoid the liberation of hydrogen cyanide in the subsequent step.) The organic layer is washed twice with 500 mL of 10% aqueous sodium cyanide solution, once with 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and twice with 500 mL of water.\n(Caution: The sodium cyanide washes should be bottled separately and labeled appropriately for approved disposal.) The organic layer is dried (anhydrous magnesium sulfate), filtered, and concentrated to provide 16.3\u201320.3 g of residue. Crystallization from a 1 : 3 methylene chloride\u2013hexane mixture at 5\u00b0C affords 13.1\u201316.9 g (70.4\u201390.7%) of beige crystals of the biphenyl, mp 215\u2013216\u00b0C (lit.3 214\u2013215\u00b0C) after drying under high vacuum (0.1 mm) (Note 4)."

            "A. N-Bromomethylphthalimide (2). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 50.0 g (0.28 mol) of N-hydroxymethylphthalimide (Note 1) and 200 mL of 48% aqueous hydrobromic acid (Note 2). The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 75 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid is added with stirring over a period of about 15 min (Note 3). On completion of the addition, the flask is removed from the ice bath, heated at 60\u201370\u00b0C for 5 hr, and then cooled overnight in a refrigerator. The solid is collected by suction filtration using a 125-mm glass funnel with a coarse frit. The crude product is washed thoroughly with three 100-mL portions of cold water, two 50-mL portions of cold 10% aqueous ammonium hydroxide, and finally with three 100-mL portions of cold water (Note 4). The crude product thus obtained is completely dried under reduced pressure at room temperature over phosphorus pentoxide to give 57.1\u201363.8 g (85\u201395%) of N-bromomethylphthalimide as a light-tan solid, mp 142\u2013147\u00b0C. Although the material thus obtained may be used in the next step without further purification, it may also be recrystallized from dry acetone, mp 147\u2013148\u00b0C (lit. mp 148\u00b0C,2 148\u2013149\u00b0C3) (Note 5).\nB. Diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate (3). A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an efficient reflux condenser (ca. 80 cm long) is charged with 51.2 g (0.21 mol) of dry N-bromophthalimide (2) and 43.1 g (0.26 mol) of freshly distilled triethyl phosphite (Note 6). The mixture is immersed in an oil bath and the temperature of the oil bath gradually increased over about 15 min to 85\u2013100\u00b0C, whereupon the solid dissolves and a vigorous, exothermic reaction ensues (Note 7). When the reaction has subsided, the oil bath is lowered and the condenser is removed. The flask is fitted for simple distillation, and ethyl bromide and other volatile materials are distilled from the reaction mixture over a period of 3\u20134 hr by continued heating at 115\u00b0C (oil bath). The resulting light-yellow oil is cooled to room temperature, whereupon it solidifies (Note 8). The crude product is collected by suction filtration and washed with three 100-mL portions of cold petroleum ether (bp 60\u201368\u00b0C) to give 50.1\u201356.3 g (80\u201390%) of diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate as white crystals, mp 60\u201363\u00b0C, which are used in the next step without further purification. Recrystallization of this material from diethyl ether/petroleum ether (bp 60\u201368\u00b0C) affords pure 3, mp 65\u201367\u00b0C (lit.,3 67\u00b0C) (Note 9).\nC. Diethyl N-benzylideneaminomethylphosphonate (5). A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. The flask is charged with 50.0 g (0.17 mol) of diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate (3) dissolved in 750 mL of absolute ethanol (Note 10). To this solution is then added 6.4 g (0.19 mol) of 95% hydrazine (Note 11) in 50 mL of absolute ethanol, and the resulting mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. The dropping funnel is replaced with a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride drying tube, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 4 hr and then cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C in an ice bath. The precipitated phthalhydrazide is collected by suction filtration and thoroughly washed with three 125-mL portions of benzene. The excess solvents and hydrazine are completely removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and then under high vacuum (0.1 mm) (Note 12) and (Note 13). The crude diethyl aminomethylphosphonate (4)4,5 (Note 14) thus obtained is dissolved in 350 mL of reagent-grade benzene, and the solution is cooled overnight in the refrigerator. Any additional phthalhydrazide that precipitates is removed by suction filtration and washed with two 25-mL portions of benzene. The filtrate and washings are combined in a 1-L, one-necked flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, and the solution is cooled to 5\u201310\u00b0C, at which time 21.2 g (0.20 mol) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde is added in one portion with stirring. The mixture is stirred for 4 hr at room temperature, the flask is fitted with a Dean\u2013Stark trap and a reflux condenser and heated overnight at reflux with constant removal of water. The solution is cooled to approximately room temperature, and the excess solvents are removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by vacuum distillation, bp 145\u2013149\u00b0C (0.05 mm), to give 37.5\u201340.2 g (84\u201390%) of pure diethyl N-benzylideneaminomethylphosphonate (5)6,7 as a light-yellow oil (Note 15).\nD. 2-Methyl-2-phenyl-4-pentenal (7). A dry, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask with 14/20 joints is fitted with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a rubber septum (Note 16). The flask is charged with 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 17) and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath, and a solution of butyllithium (12.0 mmol) in hexane (Note 18) is added with stirring. To this stirred solution is added dropwise via syringe a solution of 3.06 g (12.0 mmol) of diethyl N-benzylideneaminomethylphosphonate (5) in 5 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the colored solution is stirred an additional hour at \u221278\u00b0C. A solution containing 1.20 g (10.0 mmol) of freshly distilled acetophenone in 5 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise, and the cooling bath is removed. The solution is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and then at reflux for 2 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is poured into a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The yellow residue is partitioned between 50 mL of ether and 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride. The layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 25-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride and dried over magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration, and the excess solvents are then completely removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The resulting yellow solid is dried under reduced pressure and transferred to a 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask that is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen inlet, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and flushed thoroughly with dry nitrogen. The resulting solution of the 2-azadiene 6 (Note 20) is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C, and a solution of butyllithium (12.0 mmol) in hexane is added dropwise via syringe. The deeply colored solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 1 hr, at which time 1.81 g (15.0 mmol) of freshly distilled allyl bromide (Note 21) is added. The cooling bath is removed, and the solution is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The reaction is added to 50 mL of 3 N aqueous hydrochloric acid, and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred vigorously for 18 hr at room temperature. After the addition of 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 75-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with 75-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and saturated sodium chloride, and the washings are back washed with a 50-mL portion of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate, and the excess solvents are removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the resulting yellow oil under reduced pressure gives 1.30\u20131.45 g (75\u201383%) of pure 2-methyl-2-phenyl-4-pentenal as a colorless liquid, bp 70\u201373\u00b0C (0.1 mm) (Note 22)."

Stirring is initiated and the flask content is cooled in an ice\u2013water bath to 3\u00b0C. Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (25 mL, 40 g, 0.28 mol) (Note 2) and (Note 3) is added as rapidly as possible from the addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at less than 5\u00b0C. The cooling bath is removed and the temperature is allowed to rise to 10\u00b0C. At this point an exothermic reaction begins. Intermittent cooling is required as the temperature is kept at 10\u201315\u00b0C for 40 min. The dark-red mixture is then cooled to \u221240\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath.\nA 1.0-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a septum cap is charged with a mixture of 67 g (0.80 mol) of sodium bicarbonate, 71.5 g (0.69 mol) of sodium bisulfite, and 200 mL of water. This mixture is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath to \u221220\u00b0C with vigorous stirring. Immediately (Note 4) the reaction mixture is added dropwise via cannula at a rate such that the temperature remains at \u221210\u00b0C. This addition takes 30\u201340 min. When approximately half of the reaction solution has been added, an additional 35.7 g (0.34 mol) of sodium bisulfite is added to the aqueous quench mixture. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 40 min at \u221210\u00b0C. The light-yellow mixture (pH 7) is extracted with three 500-mL portions of chloroform (Note 5). The combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 40\u00b0C at 70 mm (Note 6). Final solvent removal with a vacuum pump gives a two-phase, oily mixture. The mixture is stirred with three 100-mL portions of hexane, and the hexane extracts are decanted (Note 7) and discarded. Removal of the final traces of solvent with a vacuum pump gives 16.1\u201322.8 g (44\u201362% yield based on chlorosulfonyl isocyanate) of a light-orange oil that slowly solidifies on standing at \u221220\u00b0C.

The apparatus is evacuated (oil pump) and filled with argon (four cycles), and a positive pressure is maintained with an argon-filled balloon on a T-tube. Dry diethyl ether (500 mL) is transferred via cannula into the flask and stirring is commenced. The addition funnel is charged with 60 mL (1.42 M in ether, 0.085 mol) of methyllithium via cannula and rapid dropwise addition is begun. The methyllithium is added over a 15-min period, during which time the solution turns from bright yellow to dark brown. The solution is heated at reflux for approximately 1.5 hr. After the solution is cooled, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The dark-brown residual solid is taken up in 80 mL of water (in air), and 13.0 g (0.088 mol) of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (Note 2) is added over a 30-min period with stirring (Note 3).

            "A. 3.7-Dithianonane-1,9-diol.2 A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser attached to a nitrogen inlet, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 250 mL of absolute ethanol. The ethanol is stirred and 5.75 g (0.25 mol) of sodium metal is cautiously added. After the sodium dissolves, the solution is warmed to 45\u201350\u00b0C and 13.5 g (0.125 mol) of 1,3-propanedithiol (Note 1) is added dropwise over a period of 15 min. To the resulting solution is added dropwise 20.1 g (0.25 mol) of 2-chloroethanol (Note 1) and the mixture is refluxed for 3\u20134 hr. The mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a viscous liquid, which is distilled to give 17.3\u201320.0 g (71\u201382%) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-diol, bp 200\u00b0C (1.5 mm) (Note 2).\nB. 3,7-Dithianonane-1,9-dithiol.2 In a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 35.0 g (0.178 mol) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-diol, 30.0 g (0.394 mol) of thiourea (Note 3), and 94 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred and refluxed for 12 hr. The resulting solution is cooled in an ice bath and 67 g (1.2 mol) of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 400 mL of water is added cautiously. The mixture is then refluxed for 3 hr. The resulting two-phase system is cooled to room temperature and the upper aqueous phase is decanted from the oily organic layer. The aqueous phase is acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with 300 mL of ether. The ethereal extract is combined with the organic layer from the reaction mixture, and this solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled to give 21.4 g (53%) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-dithiol, bp 159\u2013162\u00b0C (1.2 mm) (Note 4).\nC. 1,4,8,11-Tetrathiacyclotetradecane. A dry, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a double-necked adapter for a thermometer and the 250-mL addition funnel shown in Figure 1 (Note 5), a reflux condenser, and a mechanical stirrer with a 7-cm blade of Teflon. The entire system is kept under positive nitrogen pressure. The flask is charged with 2.2 L of N,N-dimethylformamide and 13.04 g (40 mmol) of cesium carbonate (Note 6). The mixture is stirred and heated to 55\u201360\u00b0C.\nFigure 1. Addition funnel.\nA solution of 9.12 g (40 mmol) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-dithiol and 8.08 g (40 mmol) of 1,3-dibromopropane (Note 6) in 300 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide is prepared. Half of this solution is placed in the addition funnel and added to the well-stirred suspension of cesium carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide over a period of 6\u20139 hr. The reaction mixture is then charged with another 13.04 g (40 mmol) of cesium carbonate and the second half of the solution of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-dithiol and 1,3-dibromopropane is added over a period of 6\u20139 hr (Note 7). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The N,N-dimethylformamide is distilled off as completely as possible under reduced pressure (Note 8). The residue is taken up in 300 mL of dichloromethane and washed once with 200 mL of a saturated solution of sodium chloride. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a light-yellow crystalline mass. This is taken up in 200 mL of boiling 95% ethanol and the hot liquid is decanted. The remaining sediment is boiled with 125 mL of 95% ethanol and again decanted. The two ethanol solutions are combined and stored at 10\u00b0C overnight. The white crystalline product that separates is isolated by filtration and dried. The final product obtained is 6.20\u20136.60 g (58\u201362%) of 1,4,8,11-tetrathiacyclotetradecane, mp 118\u2013119\u00b0C (lit.2 mp 119\u2013120\u00b0C) (Note 9)."

            "Caution! All three parts of this preparation should be performed in a well-ventilated hood. The reagents and the products of Parts A and B are toxic and unpleasant substances.\nA. Methyl N,N-dichlorocarbamate. A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a gas inlet, and a gas outlet is charged with 84 g (1.1 mol) of methyl carbamate, 210 g (2.6 mol) of sodium acetate, 21 g (0.35 mol) of glacial acetic acid, and 400 mL of water and cooled to \u221210 to \u221215\u00b0C (Note 1). About 175 g (2.5 mol) of chlorine is condensed in a calibrated Schlenk tube (Note 2) cooled with dry ice\u2013methanol. The cooling bath is replaced by an ice\u2013water bath (Note 3) and chlorine is passed slowly (Note 4) (over 2 hr, (Note 5)) at a constant rate into the solution, which is vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the yellow oil which settles is run off. The yellow oil is washed with three subsequent 50-mL portions of a 20% aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The crude product is then transferred to a distillation apparatus, where it is kept under reduced pressure (11\u201315 mm) at room temperature for about 20 min. The bath temperature is slowly raised to a maximum of 60\u00b0C. The product distills at 43\u00b0C (11 mm) to give 102\u2013118 g (63\u201373%, based on methyl carbamate) of a heavy yellow oil ((Note 6), (Note 7), (Note 8)).\nB. N1,N2-Bis(methoxycarbonyl)sulfur diimide. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a gas outlet stopcock, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and containing a magnetic stirring bar, is purged with dry nitrogen and charged with 53.0 g (0.37 mol) of methyl N,N-dichlorocarbamate and 0.2 mL of pyridine. The dropping funnel is filled with 20.6 g (0.2 mol) of freshly distilled sulfur dichloride (Note 9). The whole apparatus is closed and connected by way of the gas outlet to a paraffin-oil-filled valve (Note 10). About 2 mL of sulfur dichloride is then added dropwise into the stirred flask. When the evolution of chlorine has started (usually after about 5 min) (Note 11), the remainder of the sulfur dichloride is added at such a rate that three to five bubbles of chlorine per second are evolved (Note 12), without allowing the temperature of the reaction mixture to exceed 35\u00b0C for more than short intervals. The addition takes 1.5\u20132 hr. After the addition is completed and the evolution of gas has slowed down significantly, volatile materials are removed by stirring the mixture at 60\u00b0C under reduced pressure (11\u201315 mm) for about 10 min (Note 13). Further removal is accomplished at room temperature at 0.01\u20130.05 mm for approximately 1 hr. The product (33.0\u201335.0 g), a moisture-sensitive, viscous, yellow oil, is used directly without further purification (Note 14).\nC. Methyl N-(2-methyl-2-butenyl)carbamate. A 250-mL, two-necked flask, equipped with a gas outlet stopcock and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and containing a magnetic stirring bar, is flushed with dry nitrogen and charged with a solution of N1,N2-bis(methoxycarbonyl)sulfur diimide from Part B in 30 mL of dry chloroform. The solution is cooled with ice water, and 14.1 g (0.20 mol) of 2-methyl-2-butene is slowly dropped in with stirring over 1 hr. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred for another 10 hr at room temperature. The funnel is replaced by a distillation unit and most of the solvent is removed (11\u201315 mm, bath temperature 30\u00b0C). To the residue are added 240 mL of a 10% solution of potassium hydroxide in methanol and about 10 mL of water. The mixture is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature, and any precipitate is filtered off (Note 15). The residue is washed with 50 mL of methanol, and the filtrate, a red solution, is concentrated at 40\u00b0C (11\u201315 mm). The residue is taken up in 450 mL of ether and washed with four 100-mL portions of water. The ethereal layer is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and treated with charcoal until the color has changed from red to yellow, whereupon the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resultant oil is distilled at 70\u201375\u00b0C (3 mm), 62\u201364\u00b0C (0.2 mm) to give the colorless product, yield 10.7\u201313.7 g (43\u201352%, based on N,N-dichlorocarbamate) (Note 16) and (Note 17)."

            "A. Nitroso-tert-octane.2 To a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with an addition funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer are added 120 mL of methanol, 51.7 g of tert-octylamine (0.4 mol), and 90 mL of water containing 1.2 g (0.0028 mol) of the tetrasodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2.52 g (0.0076 mol) of sodium tungstate dihydrate. The solution is cooled to 15\u00b0C in an ice bath and hydrogen peroxide (361 mL of a 16% solution, 1.7 mol) (Note 1) and (Note 2) is added over 5 hr. The blue reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 16 hr and the product is extracted with petroleum ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). Unreacted amine is removed by washing twice with 2 N hydrochloric acid. After the blue organic layer is washed with brine, it is dried over MgSO4. Petroleum ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. Continued distillation of the product affords 29.7 g of nitroso-tert-octane (52%), bp 45\u201355\u00b0C, 18 mm. On standing, the product crystallizes as the colorless dimer, mp 63\u201365\u00b0C. For use in the subsequent reaction the required amount of the dimer is stirred for 1 hr in hexane to establish monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nB. N-tert-Butyl-N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine. Into a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed a solution of 22.8 g (0.16 mol of monomer) of nitroso-tert-octane in 500 mL of hexane. After the mixture is stirred for 1 hr, lead dioxide (132 g, 0.55 mol) (Note 5) is added. To the rapidly stirring mixture is added 48.8 g (0.55 mol) of tert-butylhydrazine (Note 6) dropwise at such a rate as to give brisk but controlled nitrogen evolution (approximately 30 min). Cooling is provided by an ice bath so as to maintain the reaction temperature between 15 and 25\u00b0C. Progress of the reaction is monitored visually by the disappearance of the blue nitroso monomer color (Note 7). After the blue color has disappeared (about 1.5 hr), the lead oxides are removed by filtration through a pad of Celite and the residue is washed with ether/hexane (1 : 1). The filtrate and washes are combined and the solvents are removed at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to give a 6 : 1 mixture of N-tert-butyl-N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine and N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine (Note 8) and (Note 9).\nC. tert-Butyl-tert-octylamine. In a dry, 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, and a nitrogen inlet are placed 25.6 g (0.20 mol) of naphthalene, 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 10.8 g (0.47 mol) of sodium pieces. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. To the blue-green sodium naphthalenide solution is added the hydroxylamine mixture (Note 10) in 50 mL of THF over 20 min. (Caution! Exothermic reaction.) The mixture is stirred for 2.5 hr at room temperature (Note 11). The reaction mixture is carefully decanted from excess sodium and the excess reducing agent is cautiously quenched with isopropyl alcohol. After dilution with 150 mL of hexane, the mixture is acidified with 300 mL of ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid, the aqueous layer is separated, and the organic layer extracted twice more with 100-mL portions of 2 N hydrochloric acid. The combined acidic extracts are washed with 80 mL of petroleum ether (Note 12), neutralized with 4 N sodium hydroxide, and extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The ether extract is dried over MgSO4 and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue gives a small forerun, followed by 18\u201319 g of tert-butyl-tert-octylamine, bp 79\u00b0C (17 mm). The yield is 60\u201364% based on nitroso-tert-octane (Note 13)."

            "A. (S)-( + )-2-Hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. In a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle (Note 1), an overhead stirrer bearing a two-bladed propeller (ca. 2.5-cm diameter), an effective reflux condenser with a drying tube packed with silica gel, and a plastic stopper are placed 2.5 L of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, (Note 2)) and 60 g (1.56 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4, (Note 3)). The suspension is heated under reflux for 15 min, the heating mantle is switched off, and 115.1 g (1 mol) of powdered (S)-proline (Note 4) is added in small portions (ca. 2 g, (Note 5)) to the boiling mixture at such a rate as to maintain reflux. The addition requires ca. 45 min and the contents of the flask are kept boiling for an additional 1 hr. Excess lithium aluminum hydride is then decomposed by cautiously adding a solution of 28 g of potassium hydroxide in 112 mL of water (without external heating) through a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to the boiling mixture. On hydrolysis, white salts precipitate and stirring becomes difficult. After the addition is complete (ca. 25 min), the mixture is refluxed for 15 min and the hot solution is filtered by suction through a large B\u00fcchner funnel (18-cm diameter). The precipitate is pressed dry with a beaker. Any remaining prolinol is extracted from the precipitate by refluxing with 1.5 L of tetrahydrofuran for 1 hr under mechanical stirring, followed again by suction filtration. The combined filtrates are concentrated in a 2-L flask at 30\u00b0C (Note 6) under reduced pressure to yield 115\u2013125 g of the crude hydroxymethylpyrrolidine as a pale-yellow oil.\nB. (S)-(\u2212)-1-Formyl-2-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. The 2-L flask containing the crude hydroxymethyl derivative (ca. 1 mol) is equipped with a dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar and cooled to 0\u00b0C. Eighty milliliters (1.3 mol) of methyl formate (Note 7) is added over a period of 20 min and stirring is continued for 30 min at 0\u00b0C to give a green-colored solution. Excess methyl formate is evaporated at 30\u00b0C, affording a dark oil, which is taken up in 600 mL of dichloromethane and dried twice by stirring over a sufficient amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration through Celite (Note 8), using a large column, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at 30\u00b0C. Any remaining traces of solvents are removed by stirring under reduced pressure using and oil pump (20\u00b0C at 1 mm). This procedure takes about 2 hr and yields ca. 130 g (ca. 1 mol) of the dry, crude N-formyl compound, which is used in the next step without further purification.\nC. (S)-(\u2212)-1-Formyl-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine. A 4-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser, a low-temperature thermometer, and a mineral oil bubbler is charged with a solution of the crude formyl derivative in 1.5 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 9) and flushed with argon. The solution is cooled to \u221250 to \u221260\u00b0C (internal temperature, acetone\u2013dry ice), the cooling bath is removed, and 81 mL (1.3 mol) of methyl iodide is added. Then 28.8 g (1.2 mol) of sodium hydride (Note 10) is introduced carefully in one portion.\nCaution! To prevent contact of sodium hydride with the cooling medium, it is absolutely necessary to remove the cooling bath before adding the sodium hydride. In addition, argon bubbling is stopped to avoid sodium hydride dust from being blown out of the flask.\nThe apparatus is flushed again with argon and allowed to warm to room temperature. During this period hydrogen gas evolves and a gray solid precipitates, which causes stirring to become difficult. At about 0\u00b0C the precipitate dissolves exothermally under strong evolution of hydrogen. The thermometer is replaced by a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and the solution is refluxed for 15 min and quenched by slow addition of 90 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid, without external heating. Tetrahydrofuran is removed under reduced pressure to yield the crude O-methylated compound in water.\nD. (S)-( + )-2-Methoxymethylpyrrolidine. A solution of 180 g of potassium hydroxide in 720 mL of water is added to the crude product and the mixture is vigorously stirred under argon overnight. Saturation with potassium carbonate (500 g) causes precipitation of potassium salts, which are filtered off by suction (large B\u00fcchner funnel) and washed with ether. The filtrate is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 300 mL) (Note 11), and the ether layer is acidified with 100 mL of 12 N hydrochloric acid under ice cooling in a hood (evolution of fumes) and extracted twice with 100 mL of water to yield an aqueous solution of the hydrochloride of 2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (Note 12).\nE. (S)-(\u2212)-1-Carbamoyl-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine. The aqueous amine hydrochloride solution is adjusted to a pH of 2.8\u20133.2 (Note 13) with aqueous 50% potassium hydroxide. A solution of 80 g (1 mol) of potassium cyanate (Note 14) in 140 mL of water is then added all at once at 15\u00b0C and the mixture is allowed to stir for at least 12 hr at 20\u00b0C.\nF. (S)-(\u2212)-1-Amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP). A 4-L, three-necked flask containing the crude urea is cooled to \u22125\u00b0C (internal temperature) by means of an ice\u2013salt bath and treated with a chilled (\u22125\u00b0C) solution of 168 g of potassium hydroxide in 150 mL of water. After addition of 685 mL (1.3 mol) of 1.9 N potassium hypochlorite solution (Note 15), precooled to \u22125\u00b0C, the temperature rises within 10 min to 30\u201340\u00b0C and the cooling bath is removed after the mixture reaches room temperature (Note 16). Stirring is continued for a total of 12\u201315 hr. Excess potassium hypochlorite is destroyed with a freshly prepared solution of sodium bisulfite (20 g NaHSO3 in 50 mL of H2O) and the mixture is acidified (pH 2) with a minimum amount of 12 N hydrochloric acid (ca. 350 mL) under ice cooling. A strong evolution of carbon dioxide occurs. The mixture is allowed to stir for an additional 15 min at ambient temperature, made alkaline (pH 9) with ca. 100 mL of aqueous 50% potassium hydroxide, and saturated with potassium carbonate (500 g). Precipitated potassium salts are filtered off by suction through a large B\u00fcchner funnel and washed twice with ethanol; the filtrate is extracted with a 1 : 1 chloroform/ethanol mixture (1 \u00d7 800 mL and 2 \u00d7 400 mL). During extraction salt precipitation again occurs and the salts should be filtered off as mentioned above. The organic layers are collected, concentrated under reduced pressure at 30\u00b0C (Note 17), taken up in 500 mL of chloroform, and dried twice over sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration through Celite and the solvent is stripped off as mentioned above to give 80\u201390 g of a dark oil. Immediate distillation through a 40-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column (the receiver should be cooled with ice to prevent loss of substance) yields a small forerun containing 2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine, followed by SAMP as a colorless liquid, bp 42\u00b0C at 1.8 mm (80\u00b0C bath temperature), [\u03b1]D20 \u221279.6\u00b0 (neat). Overall yields of SAMP range from 65 to 75 g (50\u201358%). A purity of ca. 95% was established by GLC analysis (Note 18). The optical antipode RAMP, [\u03b1]D20 + 79.8\u00b0 (neat), can be prepared likewise, starting from (R)-proline (Note 19)."

A 50-mL, one-necked, pear-snapped, flask equipped with a 10-cm Liebig condenser, a gas inlet tube, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 3.9 g (3.0 mmol) of SAMP (Note 1) and 3.79 mL (36 mmol) of 3-pentanone (Note 2) and the mixture is warmed at 60\u00b0C under argon overnight (Note 3). The crude product is diluted with 200 mL of ether in a 250-mL separatory funnel and washed with 30 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by short-path distillation yields 5.18 g (87%) of a colorless oil, bp 70\u201375\u00b0C at 0.5 mm, [\u03b1]D20 +297\u00b0 (benzene, c = 1).

A flame-dried, one-necked 250-mL flask with side arm, rubber septum, and magnetic stirring bar is flushed with argon (Note 5). The flask is then cooled to 0\u00b0C and 110 mL of dry ether (Note 6) and 2.97 mL (21 mmol) of dry diisopropylamine (Note 7) are added, followed by dropwise addition of 21 mmol of butyllithium (13.1 mL of a 1.6 N solution in hexane (Note 8)). Stirring is continued for 10 min and a solution of 3.96 g (20 mmol) of SAMP-hydrazone (S)-2 in 10 mL of ether is added to the stirred mixture over a 5-min period at 0\u00b0C. An additional 2 mL of ether is used to transfer all of the hydrazone (S)-2 into the reaction flask. Stirring is continued for 4 hr at 0\u00b0C, while the lithiated hydrazone precipitates. The mixture is cooled to \u2212110\u00b0C (pentane/liquid nitrogen bath) and kept for 15 min at this temperature.

The contents of the flask are poured into a mixture of 300 mL of ether plus 50 mL of water in a 500-mL separatory funnel, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 25 mL of ether.

In a nitrogen-flushed, 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar are placed 11.0 g (0.45 mol) of magnesium turnings and 50 mL of diethyl ether (Note 2). To this flask is added 10% of 78.5 g (0.5 mol) of bromobenzene in one portion (Note 3). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux without stirring to start Grignard reagent formation. When the reaction has started (Note 4), the rest of the bromobenzene in 100 mL of diethyl ether is added with stirring at such a rate that gentle reflux is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for an additional 1 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and diethyl ether is added to give a total volume of about 300 mL (Note 5). The reflux condenser and the dropping funnel are replaced by a nitrogen inlet tube and a pierced rubber septum with Teflon tube inlet (Note 6).\nIn a second nitrogen-flushed, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a two-way adapter carrying a calcium chloride tube and a rubber septum with a Teflon tube, connected to a reaction flask (1 in Fig. 1), are placed 4.4 g (31 mmol) of copper(I) bromide (Note 7) and 70 mL of diethyl ether. The ethereal Grignard solution from the reaction flask (1) is added, through the Teflon tube by means of nitrogen pressure (see Fig. 1), to this vigorously stirred suspension at \u221220\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at \u221220\u00b0C for \u00bd hr. The rubber septum is replaced by a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 40.0 g (0.26 mol) of (R)-(+)-pulegone (Note 8) in 50 mL of diethyl ether. This solution is added with stirring at \u221220\u00b0C to the dark-green reaction mixture during ca. 2 hr. After the reaction mixture is kept overnight at \u221220\u00b0C, it is added to 300 mL of vigorously stirred ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated and filtered with suction, and the residue on the funnel is washed twice with 20-mL portions of ether. The aqueous layer is saturated with ammonium chloride and extracted three times with 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude oily product (ca. 62.4 g) is used for equilibration without further purification (Note 9).\nFigure 1\nb. EQUILIBRATION OF KETONES (2). A solution of 62.4 g of crude 2 in 600 mL of ethanol, 80 mL of water, and 70.0 g (1.2 mol) of potassium hydroxide is refluxed for 3 hr. The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of about 200 mL, and 500 mL of water is added. This aqueous solution is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent is evaporated at reduced pressure. The remaining oily liquid is distilled under reduced pressure at 0.05 mm. Three fractions are collected; the first fraction (boiling range 40\u201380\u00b0C) is discarded. Fraction 2 (boiling range: 80\u2013100\u00b0C; 120\u00b0C oil-bath temperature) consists mainly of biphenyl with small amounts of ketone 2 (Note 10). Fraction 3 (boiling range: 100\u2013110\u00b0C; 140\u00b0C oil-bath temperature) contains the main quantity of ketone 2. Fraction 3 and the decanted liquid of fraction 2 are combined to yield 47.3\u201354.5 g (79\u201391%) of pale-yellow oily 2 (Note 11).\nB.

The solution is heated to reflux and maintained at this temperature. By vigorous stirring a fine suspension of sodium is obtained. To this stirred suspension a solution of 54.5 g (0.24 mol) of equilibrated 2 in 40.8 g (0.68 mol) of 2-propanol (Note 13) is added dropwise at such a rate that controlled refluxing is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for an additional 8 hr and then cooled to 0\u00b0C. The mixture is diluted with 250 mL of ether (Note 14) and carefully poured into 260 mL of ice water.

(1R,2S,5R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)cyclohexyl chloroacetate 5 (Note 16). A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a calcium chloride tube, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, a thermometer, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 20.0 g (86 mmol) of 3/4, 10.5 g (86 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline, and 30 mL of diethyl ether. This stirred mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C and a solution of 10.5 g (93 mmol) of chloroacetyl chloride in 30 mL of diethyl ether is added at such a rate that this temperature is maintained. After the reaction is stirred at 0\u00b0C for an additional hr, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, during which time N,N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride precipitates. The reaction is completed by heating to reflux for 3 hr (Note 17). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the crystalline white residue is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and 60 mL of water. The phases are separated and the organic phase is washed thoroughly with an equal volume of water; then it is washed until it is acid-free with a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. It is concentrated under reduced pressure to give about 25.0 g of a viscous oil, which crystallizes on addition of 30 mL of 90% aqueous ethanol. The crystals are filtered with suction to yield 18.6\u201321.8 g (70\u201382%) of the chloroacetate as a mixture of diastereomers.

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Friedrich condenser connected by its upper joint to a mineral oil bubbler through which passes nitrogen gas is charged with 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 1), 202.0 g (1.33 mol) of (+)-pulegone (Note 2), and 181.0 g (1.46 mol) of benzyl mercaptan (Note 3). The flask is flushed with nitrogen, 10 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide is added, the flask is stoppered, and the mixture is heated to reflux under a static pressure of nitrogen. After 2 hr at reflux the pale-yellow solution is allowed to cool, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and washed with two 500-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The combined sodium chloride layers, in turn, are extracted with three 250-mL portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation at aspirator vacuum.

A 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a variable speed Hershberg stirrer and a 500-mL Dewar condenser filled with dry ice\u2013acetone and connected by its upper joint to a mineral oil bubbler through which passes dry nitrogen gas. The flask is immersed in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath, flushed well with nitrogen and 3000 mL of ammonia is condensed into the flask via a glass tube passed through a rubber septum in the remaining neck of the flask (Note 5). Clean sodium, 125 g (5.43 g-atom), is added slowly to the ammonia with slow stirring (Note 6). Then 250.3 g (0.906 mol) of 5-methyl-2-[1-methyl-1-(phenylmethylthio)ethyl]cyclohexanone and 72.5 mL (1.8 mol) of methanol in 625 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 7) are added dropwise via a pressure-equalized addition funnel over 5 hr to the vigorously stirred (ca. 500 rpm) solution (Note 8). Stirring is continued an additional 30 min following which 150 mL of methanol is added over 2.5 hr dropwise (to avoid a violent eruption). The solution is allowed to warm slowly (Note 9) and the addition funnel and the condenser are removed to allow the ammonia to evaporate overnight. The reaction flask is immersed in an ice bath and 700 mL of water is added cautiously over an hour to the yellow solid left by evaporation of the ammonia (Note 10). The solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether, which are discarded. The aqueous layer is poured into a mixture of 500 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1000 g of ice, transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel, and extracted with four 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 200 mL of water and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at aspirator vacuum. The residual liquid is placed under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) for 1 hr to remove the remaining solvent to give 137\u2013140 g (80\u201382%) of an orange oil that is a diastereomeric mixture of which the major component constitutes 80%, as indicated by 13C NMR (Note 11).\nC.

To a bottle of 22.4% potassium hydride in oil (Note 1) is added a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar. The contents are agitated by first shaking and then stirring until a visually uniform dispersion is attained. Then 17.8 g (0.10 mol) of the dispersion is transferred (Note 2) to an oven-dried 250-mL flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar (Note 3) and (Note 4), a septum-capped inlet, and an adapter connected to a pressure-relief bubbler (mercury or oil). The apparatus is purged with dry argon or nitrogen (Note 5). The flask is charged with 100 mL of dry pentane or other volatile hydrocarbon solvent, and the contents are stirred thoroughly. The stirrer is stopped to allow the potassium hydride to settle, assisted by gentle tapping on the flask, and the supernatant liquid is drawn off with a double-ended needle under inert-gas pressure. This procedure is repeated twice to complete removal of the oil. Residual solvent is then removed in a stream of dry gas. To the dry potassium hydride powder is added rapidly 100 mL of dry 3-aminopropylamine (Note 6). Caution! Hydrogen gas evolution.
