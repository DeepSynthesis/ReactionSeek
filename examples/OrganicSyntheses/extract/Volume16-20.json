            "To a cold (0\u20135\u00b0) solution of 302 g. of potassium hydroxide sticks in 2720 cc. of distilled water is added slowly, with stirring, 96.6 g. (30.8 cc., 0.6 mole) of bromine. This solution is chilled to 0\u00b0, and 59.4 g. (0.6 mole) of succinimide (p. 562) is added with hand stirring. The mixture is warmed in a water bath to 55\u201360\u00b0, when it becomes colorless, and is held at that temperature for two hours (Note 1). After standing overnight at room temperature, it is acidified to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 380 cc., sp. gr. 1.18) (Note 2) and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath under reduced pressure. The residue is treated with 1 l. of warm 95 per cent alcohol; the undissolved potassium bromide is filtered and washed with 150\u2013200 cc. of cold alcohol in small portions. The filtrate and washings are combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is extracted with 100 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. The resulting solution is again evaporated to dryness and the residue finally extracted with 140 cc. of hot absolute alcohol (Note 3). After distilling the bulk of the alcohol, this extract is diluted with about 200 cc. of distilled water and shaken out twice with 80-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are discarded (Note 4).\nThe aqueous solution is freed of ether and alcohol and then boiled under reflux for one to one and a half hours in order to hydrolyze any \u03b2-alanine ester. After evaporating under reduced pressure to remove as much as possible of the excess hydrochloric acid, the residue is dissolved in water and diluted to exactly 1 l. A 5-cc. portion of this solution is withdrawn for determination of total halides. A suspension of silver oxide prepared from 10 per cent more than the equivalent quantity of silver nitrate (Note 5) is added to the remaining portion of the solution, and the mixture is stirred well in order to bring about complete precipitation of the halides. After standing overnight the precipitate is filtered and washed with water. The filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to about 400 cc., saturated with hydrogen sulfide, and filtered through a thin layer of decolorizing carbon. The colorless filtrate is evaporated to a volume of about 100 cc., treated with decolorizing carbon if necessary, concentrated on the steam bath until crystallization begins, and chilled. The crystals are filtered with suction, washed with a little cold alcohol, and dried. A further crop is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor and again chilling (Note 6). The combined crops (28\u201330 g., m.p. 189\u2013192\u00b0) are recrystallized from water, employing the same procedure, and yield 22\u201324 g. (41\u201345 per cent of the theoretical amount) of pure \u03b2-alanine, which melts at 197\u2013198\u00b0 (corr.) with decomposition. About 2 g. of less pure product can be secured from the final mother liquors."

            "In a 5-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 1.8 kg. (1.6 moles) of fresh 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution, 100 g. of 25 per cent potassium hydroxide solution, and 57 g. (0.35 mole) of veratronitrile (p. 622). The mixture is warmed slowly to 45\u00b0, with stirring, and the source of heat is then withdrawn. The reaction proceeds with evolution of oxygen, and the temperature continues to rise (Note 1). The amide soon begins to separate; in about fifty minutes the reaction is complete and the temperature begins to fall. The mixture is cooled to 3\u20135\u00b0 and allowed to remain in the cooling bath for one and one-half to two hours. The white crystalline product is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The veratric amide melts at 162.5\u2013163.5\u00b0 and weighs 55\u201358 g. (87\u201392 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nAn alkaline solution of sodium hypochlorite is prepared by passing chlorine (0.412 gram for each gram of the amide) (Note 2) into a mixture of 300 g. of cracked ice and a cold solution of 80 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water, contained in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask. The whole of the veratric amide (55\u201358 g.) is added in one portion, and the mixture is warmed slowly in a water bath, with mechanical stirring. The material soon darkens in color, and at 50\u201355\u00b0 (internal temperature) oily droplets begin to separate. The temperature is raised gradually to 70\u00b0 and maintained at this point for one hour. A solution of 120 g. of sodium hydroxide in 120 cc. of water is added slowly, and the temperature is increased to 80\u00b0 for an additional hour.\nUpon cooling the mixture, the oily layer of amine solidifies to a red crystalline mass. The crude amine is filtered with suction, washed with two 60-cc. portions of ice-cold water, pressed thoroughly, and transferred to an ordinary 125-cc. Claisen flask. The filtrate is extracted with three 60-cc. portions of benzene, the extracts are transferred separately to the Claisen flask, and the benzene is distilled at atmospheric pressure (Note 3). The residual amine is distilled under reduced pressure and is collected at 172\u2013174\u00b0/24 mm. (Note 4). The distillate solidifies quickly to a mass of colorless crystals which melt sharply at 87.5\u201388\u00b0 (Note 5). From 58 g. (0.32 mole) of veratric amide there is obtained 39\u201340 g. (80\u201382 per cent of the theoretical amount) of 4-aminoveratrole."

The alcohol solution is added slowly enough so that practically no gas is evolved, and the temperature is kept at \u00b11\u00b0. This usually requires from one and one-half to two hours.\nThe resulting mixture is allowed to stand in the ice-salt bath until it separates into layers, and the liquid layers are decanted from the sodium sulfate into a separatory funnel (Note 3). The lower aqueous layer is removed and the butyl nitrite layer washed twice with 50-cc. portions of a solution containing 2 g. of sodium bicarbonate and 25 g. of sodium chloride in 100 cc. of water. After drying over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the yield of practically pure butyl nitrite amounts to 420\u2013440 g. (81\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4) and (Note 5).

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 1-l. beaker 21.2 g. (0.1 mole) of o-tolidine is made into a thin paste with 300 cc. of water and dissolved by the addition of 20 cc. (23.6 g., 0.23 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), warming a little if necessary. The solution is cooled to 10\u00b0 with ice, mechanical agitation is started, and 21 cc. (25 g., 0.24 mole) more of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added (Note 1). This causes partial separation of o-tolidine dihydrochloride. The temperature being kept at 10\u201315\u00b0, a solution of 14.5 g. (0.2 mole) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 40 cc. of water is run in rapidly, the last 10 per cent being held back and added slowly as needed to give a distinct positive test for nitrous acid on starch-iodide paper. This excess is maintained for one-half hour. Throughout the diazotization an excess of hydrochloric acid should be present as shown by a strong test on Congo red paper. When the diazotization is complete, the excess nitrous acid is eliminated by the careful addition of a small amount of o-tolidine hydrochloride solution, using starch-iodide paper to arrive at an exact balance (Note 2).\nIn a 3-l. beaker a paste is made from 82 g. (0.21 mole) of 88 per cent technical Chicago acid (1-amino-8-naphthol-2,4-disulfonic acid) (Note 3) and 500 cc. of water, and solution effected by the addition of 8 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water, testing with litmus toward the end and leaving the reaction still acid (Note 4). The solution is cooled to 18\u00b0 by the addition of ice, and just before the coupling 35 g. (0.33 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added.\nWith vigorous mechanical agitation the diazonium salt solution is run into the Chicago acid solution rather rapidly. The blue dye which separates at first, gradually dissolves on further stirring. After one-half hour the solution is tested for alkalinity (Note 5) and for completeness of coupling (Note 6) and (Note 7).\nAfter stirring for a total of two hours, the mixture is heated to 85\u00b0, 15 g. of decolorizing carbon is added, and the solution stirred for fifteen minutes and filtered. The filtrate is reheated to 85\u00b0 with agitation and the volume estimated. For each 100 cc. of the solution 27 g. of hydrated sodium acetate (usually 450\u2013500 g. in all) is added slowly, with vigorous stirring, in four or five portions (Note 8). The dye is thus caused to separate in an easily filterable form. On \"spotting\" a drop of the mixture on filter paper by means of a stirring rod, the dye should form a dark blue mass in the center of a red or violet rim (Note 9). The mixture, while still warm, is filtered with suction on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and as much as possible of the mother liquor is removed (Note 10). The filter cake is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water at 85\u00b0 and resalted as above with about 300 g. of sodium acetate, in several portions, or until most of the dye is salted out. In a \"spot\" test on filter paper, little red should be left in the rim. The product is collected, redissolved in 1.2 l. of water at 85\u00b0, and salted again. This time enough sodium acetate should be added to give a small rim which shows no red impurity (Note 11). The product is collected, dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 for at least twenty-four hours, ground, and passed through a 40-mesh sieve.\nThe sodium acetate is then extracted by digesting the sifted dye for ten to fifteen minutes with successive 500-cc. portions of boiling 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, filtering with suction after each extraction, and washing the product on the filter with a little alcohol (Note 12). After four alcohol extractions the filtrate should give a negative test for acetate. The product, which changes in appearance from bronze to green during the extraction, is dried in air at room temperature. The yield is 80\u201381 g. (83\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount) of dye free from inorganic salts and organic impurities (Note 13)."

            "(A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.\u2014In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1) and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide (Note 2). The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234\u2013238\u00b0, amounts to 80\u201390 g. (66\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.\n(B) Dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine.\u2014The following operations should be performed under a hood. In a 2-l. three-necked flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and two dropping funnels, are placed 80 g. (0.33 mole) of dibenzoylhydrazine, 10 g. (0.25 mole) of sodium hydroxide, and 600 cc. of water. The mixture is maintained at about 90\u00b0 (Note 3) by heating on a water bath. With stirring, 320 g. (240 cc., 2.54 moles) of methyl sulfate (Note 4) and 250 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 125 g. (3.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added from separate dropping funnels. The methyl sulfate is added in 10-cc. portions at five-minute intervals, the sodium hydroxide solution at a rate that maintains the reaction mixture slightly alkaline. When markedly alkaline the mixture has a distinctly yellow color; it is best to maintain a degree of alkalinity slightly less than that required to produce this color.\nDuring the additions, which require about two hours, the dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine separates as a supernatant liquid (Note 5); the semisolid material thrown up on the sides of the flask must be washed down from time to time. After being heated for one-half hour longer the mixture is allowed to cool. The solid dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine is collected, crushed with water, filtered, and dissolved in 100 cc. of chloroform. The solution is filtered from insoluble impurities and dried over sodium sulfate; the chloroform is removed by heating on a water bath, finally under reduced pressure. The solid residue melts at 77\u201384\u00b0 and is sufficiently pure for further use. The yield is 77\u201383 g. (86\u201393 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6).\n(C) Dimethylhydrazine Dihydrochloride.\u2014In a 2-l. flask, a mixture of 67 g. (0.25 mole) of dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine and 250 cc. of 32 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.16) is refluxed gently for two hours under a hood. To remove the benzoic acid, the mixture is steam-distilled until 10 l. of distillate has collected (Note 7); the residual liquor is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath. The crystalline dihydrochloride is treated with 25 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, and the mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. This treatment is repeated, and the dihydrochloride is crushed with a mixture of 25 cc. of absolute alcohol and 2\u20133 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtered, and washed with 10\u201315 cc. of cold absolute alcohol. The first fraction of dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride, after being dried in a vacuum desiccator, weighs 22\u201323 g. By evaporation of the mother liquors and further treatment with 5\u20136 cc. of absolute alcohol and a little hydrochloric acid, a second fraction of 3 g. of the hydrochloride is obtained. Repetition of this procedure yields a third fraction amounting to about 0.5 g. (Note 8). The total yield is 25\u201326 g. (75\u201378 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

The resulting solution is stirred vigorously and maintained at 70\u201375\u00b0 by heating on a water bath, while 235 g. (3.23 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite suspended in 150 cc. of water is added from a dropping funnel over a period of an hour. The reaction mixture is tested frequently and maintained barely acid to litmus by further 1-cc. additions of 2 N hydrochloric acid when necessary (about 30\u201335 cc. of acid is required). Stirring and heating are continued for two hours after all the sodium nitrite has been added.\nThe flask is arranged for distillation, and the reaction mixture is distilled under slightly diminished pressure on a water bath until the residue is practically dry. To the residue 100 cc. of water is added, and the process of distillation to dryness is repeated. The distillates are combined and saturated with potassium carbonate (about 300 g. is required); the upper layer of dimethylnitrosoamine is removed, and the water layer is extracted with three 140-cc. portions of ether. The combined nitrosoamine and ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and distilled through a 30-cm. fractionating column. The yield of product boiling at 149\u2013150\u00b0 /755 mm. is 195\u2013200 g. (88\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount). Nitrosodimethylamine is a yellow oil which darkens in bright light.\n(B) unsym.-Dimethylhydrazine Hydrochloride.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer, are put 200 g. (2.7 moles) of nitrosodimethylamine, 3 l. of water, and 650 g. (10 gram atoms) of 100 per cent zinc dust, or an equivalent amount of lower-quality material (Note 1). While the mixture is stirred and maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0 by immersion in a water bath, 1 l. (14 moles) of 85 per cent acetic acid is added from the dropping funnel over a period of two hours. Subsequently the reaction mixture is heated for one hour at 60\u00b0, allowed to cool, and the excess zinc dust filtered and washed with a little water. The aqueous liquors are combined and transferred to a 12-l. flask arranged for steam distillation. The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, and the steam inlet is provided with a trap. A large filtering or distilling flask serves as the receiver, and the side tube is connected with two absorption flasks, each containing 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid (Note 2). The aqueous liquors are made distinctly alkaline by adding a concentrated solution of 1 kg. of sodium hydroxide through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is then steam-distilled until a test portion of the distillate shows only a faint reduction with Fehling's solution. Usually about 5\u20136 l. of distillate suffices to remove the dimethylhydrazine. The distillation is more rapid if a free flame is placed under the distillation flask.\nThe aqueous distillate is treated with 650 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated on a steam bath, under reduced pressure, until the residual liquor becomes a syrupy mass (Note 3). This is desiccated further by adding 150 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol and evaporating under reduced pressure. Two or three such treatments with alcohol dry the crystalline material sufficiently so that it no longer sticks to the sides of the flask. The crude product is dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride. The pale yellow, dry, crystalline solid weighs 200\u2013215 g. (77\u201383 per cent of the theoretical amount). The dried product may be purified by dissolving it in an equal weight of boiling absolute ethyl alcohol and then chilling in an ice bath. The yield of pure white crystals melting at 81\u201382\u00b0 is 180\u2013190 g. (69\u201373 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4)."

            "(A) Epichlorohydrin.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 1350 g. (988 cc., 10.5 moles) of glycerol \u03b1,\u03b3-dichlorohydrin (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 292), 840 g. (10 moles) of technical, finely powdered calcium hydroxide (88 per cent), and 840 cc. of water (20\u00b0) are shaken vigorously for fifteen minutes (Note 1). The mixture forms a thick paste at the beginning, but the epichlorohydrin soon separates from the calcium salts as a mobile liquid. The flask is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a wide delivery tube, and the mixture is distilled from a water bath, at first under 40\u201350 mm. pressure. The pressure is then lowered to 10 mm. and the temperature raised gradually to 95\u2013100\u00b0 (Note 2). The receiver must be cooled effectively in an ice-salt mixture to \u22125\u00b0 or below, to ensure a maximum yield. The distillate is transferred to a separatory funnel, the upper, aqueous, layer returned to the reaction flask, and the distillation repeated. A third distillation in a similar manner gives a small additional amount of epichlorohydrin (Note 3). The lower layers from the successive distillations are combined and distilled through a fractionating column, under reduced pressure. The epichlorohydrin fraction is collected up to 75\u00b0/50 mm., and the residue (about 160\u2013180 cc.), which contains a large percentage of dichlorohydrin, is returned to the original reaction flask, together with 150 cc. of water. This material is distilled once under reduced pressure as described above, and the lower layer of the distillate is combined with the main fraction of epichlorohydrin. The crude product is distilled at ordinary pressure until the temperature of the vapor reaches 115\u00b0; at this point the distillation is stopped and the water layer removed from the distillate. The lower layer of the distillate is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and returned to the distilling flask. After a small fore-run, the epichlorohydrin distils at 115\u2013117\u00b0. The yield is 650\u2013700 g. (67\u201372 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Epibromohydrin.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 2140 g. (1 l., 9.8 moles) of glycerol \u03b1,\u03b3-dibromohydrin (p. 308) is suspended in 1.5 l. of water, and 400 g. of technical, powdered calcium hydroxide (88 per cent) is added gradually, with shaking, in the course of about fifteen minutes. A further 400 g. of calcium hydroxide (total, 9.5 moles) is added at once, and the epibromohydrin is distilled at reduced pressure in the manner described for epichlorohydrin (Note 2). The combined lower layers from two such distillations (about 750 cc.) are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and fractionated at atmospheric or reduced pressure. The yield of epibromohydrin, b.p. 134\u2013136\u00b0 or 61\u201362\u00b0/50 mm., is 1130\u20131200 g. (84\u201389 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

(1 gram atom) of cleanly cut sodium is added in portions. When the sodium has dissolved the solution is cooled to 60\u00b0, and 146 g. (1 mole) of ethyl oxalate (Note 2) is added in a rapid stream through the funnel with vigorous stirring. This is washed down with a small quantity of absolute alcohol and is followed immediately by the addition of 175 g. (1.06 moles) of ethyl phenylacetate. Stirring is discontinued at once, the reaction flask is lowered from the stirrer, and a 2-l. beaker is made ready. Within four to six minutes after the ethyl phenylacetate has been added crystallization sets in. The contents of the flask are transferred immediately to the beaker at the first sign of crystallization, which is nearly instantaneous.\nThe nearly solid paste of the sodium derivative is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stirred thoroughly with 800 cc. of dry ether. The solid is collected by suction and washed repeatedly with dry ether. The phenyloxaloacetic ester is liberated from the sodium salt with dilute sulfuric acid (29 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 500 cc. of water). The almost colorless oil is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-cc. portions of ether, which are combined with the oil. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is distilled. The residual oil, contained in a modified Claisen flask having a fractionating side arm, is heated under a pressure of about 15 mm. in a bath of Wood's metal. The temperature of the bath is brought gradually to 175\u00b0 and kept there until the evolution of carbon monoxide is complete. During this process the heating is momentarily discontinued in the event of a temporary increase in pressure. At the end of the reaction (five to six hours) the oil which has distilled is returned to the flask, and the ethyl phenylmalonate is distilled at reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 158\u2013162\u00b0/10 mm. weighs 189\u2013201 g. (80\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "In a 12-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser and an efficient, liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 1) are placed 2.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, 872 g. (3.5 moles) of pure n-dodecyl bromide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 29, and p. 246 above), and 278 g. (3.85 moles) of powdered 90 per cent potassium cyanide (Note 2). The mixture is refluxed for fifteen hours, with stirring, in a water bath (Note 3). At the end of this time another 278-g. portion of potassium cyanide is added and the mixture refluxed, with stirring, for fifteen hours longer.\nThe flask is allowed to cool, and a solution of 670 g. of 90 per cent potassium hydroxide in 1 l. of water is added (Note 4). The solution is refluxed and stirred for thirty hours. The flask is fitted with a head for steam distillation (Note 5), and steam is passed in until foaming prevents further distillation. When the flask has cooled somewhat, the steam inlet is replaced by a separatory funnel with a stem reaching to the bottom of the flask, and 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) or the equivalent amount of more dilute acid is added. The flask is shaken occasionally to prevent stratification of the hydrochloric acid. The dropping funnel is then replaced by the steam inlet, and steam is passed through for about one-half hour. At the end of this time the water layer is siphoned off and discarded (Note 6).\nThe crude acid while still warm and fluid is treated with 815 cc. (14 moles) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol containing 20\u201330 g. (3\u20135 per cent by weight) of anhydrous hydrogen chloride, and the solution is filtered from insoluble impurities. The filtrate is placed in a 3-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser, 160 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride is added, and the mixture is refluxed for twenty-four hours (Note 7). The lower layer is siphoned off and diluted with twice its volume of water to recover any dissolved ester. The recovered ester is combined with the main portion, 408 cc. of alcohol containing 3\u20135 per cent of anhydrous hydrogen chloride and 80 g. of calcium chloride are added, and the mixture is refluxed for another twenty-four hours. The lower layer is siphoned off and the dissolved ester recovered as before. The upper layer is washed twice with an equal volume of warm water (30\u201340\u00b0) and transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel; the volume of the oil is approximately 1 l. About 500 cc. of warm water and a few drops of phenolphthalein are also placed in the funnel, and very dilute aqueous ammonia (concentrated aqueous ammonia diluted with twenty volumes of water) is added, with shaking, until the resulting emulsion has a distinctly pink color (50\u2013100 cc. is required). Alcohol is added in portions of about 100 cc. until the emulsion is broken and the layers begin to separate quite rapidly; usually two or three additions of alcohol suffice. The lower layer is drawn off and set aside (Note 8). The oil is washed three times with warm water; if necessary, alcohol is added to break the emulsion. The ester is dried with anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of ethyl tridecylate, b.p. 163\u2013165\u00b0/5 mm. (178\u2013180\u00b0/20 mm.; 197\u2013198\u00b0/60 mm.) is 615\u2013660 g. (73\u201378 per cent of the theoretical amount). By refractionating the fore- and after-runs, an additional 50\u201370 g. of product is obtained; 15\u201330 g. of ester and acid are recovered from the ammoniacal washings and from the calcium chloride used to dry the main portion. The total yield is 685\u2013710 g. (81\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

            "In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a 250-cc. dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a calcium chloride tube, are placed 30 g. (1.25 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings, 50 cc. of dry ether, and a small crystal of iodine. Stirring is started, and 5 cc. (6 g.) of n-amyl bromide is added (Note 1). As soon as the reaction has started, 300 cc. of dry ether is added and then, more slowly, a solution of 183 g. (total, 189 g.; 1.25 moles) of n-amyl bromide in 150 cc. of dry ether. If external cooling is provided, all the alkyl halide may be added within half an hour; the solution is refluxed gently for another half-hour to complete the reaction. The heat is removed, the flask cooled to 50\u00b0, and 148 g. (1 mole) of ethyl orthoformate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 258) is added during the course of fifteen to twenty minutes. The mixture is refluxed for six hours (Note 2); at the end of this time the condenser is arranged for distillation and the ether is removed completely with the aid of a steam bath.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled and treated carefully with 750 cc. of chilled 6 per cent hydrochloric acid. The contents of the flask are kept cool by the occasional addition of ice while the acid is being introduced. As soon as all the solid has dissolved (Note 3), the upper oily layer of hexaldehyde acetal is separated. The acetal is hydrolyzed by distilling it with a solution of 100 g. (55 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 700 cc. of water. The free aldehyde distils rapidly, and the distillation is complete when a sample of fresh distillate contains 5 per cent or less of immiscible oil. The distillate is collected in a solution of 100 g. (1 mole) of sodium bisulfite in 300 cc. of water. The mixture is shaken vigorously for several minutes; the oily layer remaining undissolved in the bisulfite solution is principally n-amyl alcohol and is discarded. To remove the remainder of the amyl alcohol and other impurities the bisulfite solution is steam-distilled until 200 cc. of distillate has been collected.\nThe residual aldehyde-bisulfite solution is cooled to 40\u201350\u00b0, a suspension of 80 g. of sodium bicarbonate in 200 cc. of water is added carefully, and the free aldehyde is removed by steam distillation. The upper layer of the distillate is separated, washed with three 50-cc. portions of water (Note 4), dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled through a 20-cm. column. The yield of n-hexaldehyde b.p. 126\u2013129\u00b0 , is 45\u201350 g. (45\u201350 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "A 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask (A, Fig. 11) is provided with a reflux condenser, liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, and two gas delivery tubes (T1 and T2) which extend as far as possible into the flask. Methyl nitrite is generated in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask B which is fitted with a 500-cc. dropping funnel C and connected to A by the tube T1. Dry hydrogen chloride is introduced through T2. The apparatus is assembled preferably in a hood with effective draft.\nFig. 11\nIn A is placed a solution of 469 g. (3.5 moles) of propiophenone (Note 1) in 2.3 l. of ordinary ethyl ether, and in B a mixture of 290 g. (4 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite, 180 cc. (142 g., 4.5 moles) of methyl alcohol, and 170 cc. of water. In the dropping funnel C is placed 455 cc. of cold dilute sulfuric acid (prepared by adding one volume of concentrated acid to two volumes of water).\nThe stirrer is started, and hydrogen chloride is introduced through T2 at the rate of 6\u201310 bubbles a second. The acid in C is allowed to drop slowly into B, and the gaseous methyl nitrite (Note 2) is introduced through T1 into the reaction mixture. The solution in A develops a brown-red color, and after about ten minutes the ether begins to reflux gently (Note 3). The rate of evolution of methyl nitrite is then adjusted so that the ether continues to reflux gently. About four hours is required for addition of the methyl nitrite. Stirring and addition of hydrogen chloride are continued for thirty minutes longer; at the end of this time the solution has ceased boiling and has assumed a clear yellow color.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to stand for several hours (preferably overnight) and is then extracted repeatedly with 500-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, until the alkaline extracting medium remains practically colorless when shaken with the ethereal solution (Note 4). Usually five 500-cc. portions of the sodium hydroxide solution are required. The combined alkaline extracts are poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 700\u2013750 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 1 kg. of ice. The crystals of isonitrosopropiophenone are filtered with suction and dried. The product weighs 370\u2013390 g. (65\u201368 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 111\u2013113\u00b0. This material can be crystallized from about 550 cc. of toluene and yields 315\u2013335 g. of snow-white crystals, m.p. 112\u2013113\u00b0 (Note 5)."

            "The reaction is carried out in the apparatus shown in Fig. 13. A-A is a Pyrex combustion tube, 90 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter, fitted with an inlet chamber B, having a sealed-in side arm C and bearing a separatory funnel E. The center 60 cm. of the tube is filled with thorium oxide catalyst (Note 1) held in place at the lower end by indentations in the combustion tube. The hot junction D of a pyrometer is placed in contact with the glass tube at its center, and the catalyst-filled section of the tube is wrapped with a thin layer of asbestos paper. The tube is supported in an electrically heated cylindrical furnace, 60 cm. in length, which is inclined slightly from the horizontal. The annular space between the tube and the furnace is plugged at the ends with asbestos in order to produce a uniform temperature throughout the tube and to hold the glass tube in place. The lower end of the reaction tube is connected through the adapter F to a vertical glass tube G, 40 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter, which is filled with glass beads and serves as the condenser. An Erlenmeyer flask or other suitable receiver is placed at the lower end of G.\nFig. 13\nThe furnace is heated to 430\u2013450\u00b0, and simultaneously the tube is swept out thoroughly with a stream of carbon dioxide, introduced through the side arm C. The carbon dioxide is passed through a wash bottle of concentrated sulfuric acid to dry it and to estimate the rate of flow. A solution of 136 g. (1 mole) of phenylacetic acid, m.p. 77\u201379\u00b0 (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), in 120 cc. (120 g., 2 moles) of glacial acetic acid is placed in the separatory funnel E and is introduced into the inlet chamber B at the rate of twelve to fifteen drops per minute. The entire solution should run through in twelve to fifteen hours. Meanwhile a very slow stream of carbon dioxide (one bubble per second) is passed through the tube C, to keep the gases in motion. After all the solution has been added, the funnel is rinsed with 10 cc. of glacial acetic acid, and this is passed through the reaction tube to facilitate removal of the product. The distillate consists of a slightly fluorescent light brown oil and an aqueous layer; both layers are treated with 300 g. of a mixture of ice and water, and rendered alkaline to litmus with a slight excess of 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (Note 2).\nThe oil is separated (Note 3), and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-cc. portions of benzene. The extracts are combined with the oil, and the solvent is removed by distillation. Fractionation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 80\u201395 g. of a methyl benzyl ketone fraction, boiling at 110\u2013120\u00b0/21\u201322 mm., and a residue of dibenzyl ketone (Note 4). The main fraction on redistillation yields 74\u201387 g. (55\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount) of methyl benzyl ketone boiling at 110\u2013115\u00b0/21\u201322 mm. (Note 5), (Note 6), and (Note 7).",
            "Three hundred fifty cubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid is placed in a 3-l. flask and cooled to \u221210\u00b0. The total first crop of moist \u03b1-phenylacetoacetonitrile obtained according to the procedure on p. 487 (corresponding to 188\u2013206 g., or 1.2\u20131.3 moles of dry product) is added slowly, with shaking, the temperature being kept below 20\u00b0 (Note 1). After all is added the flask is warmed on the steam bath until solution is complete and then for five minutes longer. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0, 1750 cc. of water added rapidly, and the flask placed on a vigorously boiling water bath and heated for two hours, with occasional shaking. The ketone forms a layer and, after cooling, is separated and the acid layer extracted with 600 cc. of ether. The oil and ether layers are washed successively with 100 cc. of water, the ether combined with the oil and dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is collected on a filter, washed with ether, and discarded. The ether is removed from the filtrates, and the residue distilled from a modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The fraction boiling at 109\u2013112\u00b0/24 mm. is collected; it weighs 125\u2013150 g. (77\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 2)."

            "(A) Benzalazine.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a stout glass mechanical stirrer, are placed 240 g. (1.85 moles) of powdered hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309), 1.8 l. of water, and 230 cc. (207 g., 3.4 moles) of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The mixture is stirred, and, when the hydrazine sulfate has dissolved, 440 cc. (460 g., 4.35 moles) of benzaldehyde (Note 1) is added from a separatory funnel during the course of four to five hours (Note 2). After the mixture has been stirred for a further two hours, the precipitated benzalazine is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed thoroughly on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The product is dissolved in 800 cc. of boiling 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and, on cooling, the azine separates in yellow needles melting at 92\u201393\u00b0. The yield is 350\u2013360 g. (91\u201394 per cent of the theoretical amount); an additional 10\u201315 g. of less pure material can be isolated from the mother liquors. The azine is freed of ethyl alcohol by drying in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride.\n(B) Methylhydrazine Sulfate.\u2014Two hundred grams (0.96 mole) of benzalazine, 350 cc. of dry, thiophene-free benzene, and 100 cc. (133 g., 1.05 moles) of dimethylsulfate (Note 3) are mixed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride tube. The mixture is heated continuously, with occasional shaking, on a water bath to gentle refluxing for five hours. The mixture is cooled, and the solid addition product is decomposed by adding 600 cc. of water and shaking until all the solid material has disappeared. The benzene and benzaldehyde are removed by steam distillation; the residual liquor, after cooling, is treated with 15\u201320 cc. of benzaldehyde and left overnight. The resin and benzalazine are separated by filtration (Note 4).\nThe filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure on a water bath until a semi-crystalline mass remains; this is further desiccated by evaporating twice under reduced pressure with 50-cc. portions of absolute ethyl alcohol. The resulting crystalline cake is crushed with 50 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, filtered, and the process repeated. The white, crystalline product is almost pure methylhydrazine sulfate and contains very little hydrazine sulfate. After drying in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride, the yield is 105\u2013110 g. (76\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount). For purification, the sulfate is dissolved in about 250 cc. of boiling 80 per cent ethyl alcohol, and any undissolved material (chiefly hydrazine sulfate) is filtered. On cooling, the methylhydrazine sulfate separates in white plates, which are filtered with suction and washed with a little absolute alcohol. After drying over calcium chloride, the first fraction, m.p. 141\u2013142\u00b0, weighs 70\u201375 g. (51\u201354 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5)."

In the flask is placed 2.5 l. of anhydrous butyl alcohol (Note 1), and 115 g. (5 gram atoms) of clean, bright sodium cut in small pieces is added at one time. Solution of the sodium may be facilitated by stirring, but heating is unnecessary. After the sodium has dissolved completely, the solution is allowed to cool to 70\u201380\u00b0, and then 800 g. (5 moles) of redistilled ethyl malonate (b.p. 135\u2013136\u00b0/100 mm.) is added rapidly with stirring. After heating the reaction solution to 80\u201390\u00b0, 913 g. (5.1 moles) of pure heptyl bromide (p. 247, b.p. 179\u2013180\u00b0) is added. The bromide should be added rather slowly at first, until precipitation of sodium bromide begins; it may then be added at such a rate that the butyl alcohol refluxes gently. Usually about one hour is required for the introduction of the heptyl bromide. The mixture is refluxed gently until it is neutral to litmus (about one hour).\nThe entire mixture, including the precipitated sodium bromide, is transferred to a 12-l. flask together with a small amount of water used to rinse the reaction flask. A solution of 775 g. (12.5 moles) of 90 per cent potassium hydroxide in an equal weight of water is added slowly with shaking. The mixture is heated cautiously, with occasional shaking, until refluxing starts (Note 2), and refluxing is continued until saponification is complete (about four or five hours). The flask is fitted at once for steam distillation (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 479), and the mixture is distilled until no more butyl alcohol passes over (Note 3). To the residue 1350 cc. (15.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added carefully, with shaking, and the mixture is refluxed for about one hour (Note 4). After cooling, the water layer is siphoned off and discarded (Note 5).\nThe oil obtained in the preceding step is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and heated under an air-cooled reflux condenser in an oil bath at about 180\u00b0. When the evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased (about two hours), the oil is decanted from a small amount of solid material.

            "The sulfonation is carried out in a 2-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a stirrer (Note 1). Five hundred grams (2.8 moles) of pure phenanthrene (Note 2) is melted in the flask, which is clamped in an oil bath heated to 110\u00b0. Mechanical stirring is started, and 327 cc. (600 g., 5.8 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid is run in at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 120\u00b0 (ten to fifteen minutes). The reaction mixture is stirred and maintained at a temperature of 120\u2013125\u00b0 for three and one-half hours, when a test portion should give a nearly clear solution in water. The reaction is exothermic, and the bath must be kept at a temperature 5\u201310\u00b0 below that of the mixture. Some sulfur dioxide is given off, and the mixture becomes green.\nThe viscous solution, while still hot, is dissolved in 4 l. of water, and a solution of 400 g. of sodium hydroxide in 600\u2013800 cc. of water is added. After thorough cooling in an ice bath, the precipitated sodium salt is collected on a large funnel, pressed well, and washed thoroughly with 1 l. of half-saturated sodium chloride solution (about 180 g. per liter). The precipitate contains chiefly the sodium 2- and 3-sulfonates. The filtrate contains a mixture of disulfonates and is discarded (Note 3). In order to effect a preliminary concentration of the less-soluble 2-isomer, the sodium salt mixture is dissolved in 7\u20138 l. of boiling water containing 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 4), and the filtered solution is then neutralized with sodium hydroxide and allowed to crystallize. After separating the mother liquor (A), which is saved, the crystals (consisting largely of the sodium 2-sulfonate) are dissolved in about 8 l. of boiling water (Note 5), and 100 g. of solid barium chloride dihydrate is added to the hot solution. The fine white precipitate of barium 2-phenanthrenesulfonate which forms is digested at the boiling point for a short time and then brought onto a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, preheated on the steam bath. The mother liquor (B) is saved.\nThe precipitated barium 2-sulfonate always retains a certain quantity of the 3-sulfonate, which must be extracted with hot water. The precipitate is digested at the boiling point with 6-l. portions of boiling water until the residual salt is found to be free from isomers. The purity is determined from the melting point of the p-toluidine salt, in the manner described below. Usually two or three such washings are required. The mother liquor (B) from the barium 2-sulfonate is combined with the various washings, and the whole is boiled down to a volume of about 6 l. Sulfuric acid (25\u201330 cc. of concentrated acid, diluted with water) is then added to precipitate the barium; the filtered solution (Note 6) is concentrated to about 2 l. and neutralized with potassium hydroxide to bring down a mixture of potassium sulfonates (C). The filtrate from the potassium salts may be boiled down further and treated with potassium chloride to ensure complete recovery of the potassium sulfonates, and then discarded. The potassium salt mixture collected in these operations is set aside. (C).\nThe mother liquor (A) from the sodium salt crystallization is boiled down to a volume of about 2\u20133 l., and 200 g. of potassium chloride is added to the hot solution. The potassium salt mixture which separates on cooling is collected and combined with the potassium salts (C) described in the preceding paragraph; the filtrate is discarded. The combined material is dissolved in the minimum amount of hot water, and the filtered solution is heated to boiling and allowed to cool without disturbance. It deposits a large crop of the potassium 3-sulfonate in a very pure condition (180\u2013210 g.). The mother liquor, containing more of the 3-sulfonate together with some of the 2-sulfonate, is concentrated to a small volume; the product is salted out with potassium chloride and washed free of sulfate ion with potassium chloride solution. A hot aqueous solution of this material is then treated with 10 g. of barium chloride dihydrate, and the precipitated barium 2-sulfonate (5\u201310 g.) is washed free of isomers. The original filtrate is reserved, but the washings are discarded. From the original filtrate, by evaporation, precipitation of the barium with sulfuric acid, neutralization with potassium hydroxide, and crystallization of the product, there is obtained an additional quantity of the pure potassium 3-sulfonate (50\u201370 g.).\nThe yields are: barium 2-phenanthrenesulfonate, 150\u2013200 g. (17\u201321 per cent); potassium 3-phenanthrenesulfonate, 200\u2013220 g. (24\u201326 per cent) (Note 7)and(Note 8).\nIdentification and Test of Purity.\u2014The method1 consists in the preparation and examination of a test sample of the p-toluidine salt of the sulfonic acid (Note 9). An aqueous solution of the free sulfonic acid (or of the sodium or potassium salt) is treated with an excess of p-toluidine and hydrochloric acid, enough water is added to bring all the material into solution at the boiling point, and crystallization is allowed to take place. The crystals should be washed well with water. A barium salt should be boiled with dilute sulfuric acid, a little decolorizing carbon added, and the filtered solution treated with p-toluidine. If the amine salt separates in an oily condition, the walls of the vessel should be scratched, for the p-toluidine salt, particularly that of the 3-acid, may remain as an oil for a short time, even when nearly pure. On the other hand, a rather impure acid gives a p-toluidine salt which remains as an oil almost indefinitely. This property characterizes a mixture of isomers nearly as definitely as the depression in the melting point, though this is large. In determining the melting point of an amine salt, the sample may be dried by pressing the material on a filter paper, but the capillary should be placed in the bath when the temperature is below 130\u00b0. The preliminary heating gives ample provision for thorough drying, without which the material may melt twenty to thirty degrees below the true melting point.\nThe p-toluidine salt of 2-phenanthrenesulfonic acid forms flat needles or plates melting at 282\u00b0 (291\u00b0 corr.); that of the 3-acid forms thick needles melting at 217\u00b0 (222\u00b0 corr.)."

            "In a 1-l. distilling flask, fitted with a side arm 40 cm. in length and not less than 10 mm. in internal diameter (Note 1), is placed 236 g. (2 moles) of succinic acid. To this is added slowly, with cooling and shaking, 270 cc. (243 g., 4 moles) of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). Most of the acid dissolves, forming a clear solution. The flask is set for downward distillation, and a water-cooled 500-cc. distilling flask is attached to the side arm. Provision may be made for removal of ammonia from the side tube of the receiver. The mixture is heated gently over a free flame; solution takes place rapidly, and a small amount of uncombined ammonia passes over with the first portions of the distillate. The temperature of the vapor rises to 100\u00b0 and remains at this point until about 200 cc. of water has distilled. The flame is then increased, and the ammonium succinate begins to decompose with evolution of ammonia; the temperature of the vapor falls to 97\u00b0 during the distillation of the next 30 cc. When the vapor temperature has risen to 102\u00b0, the receiver is changed and an intermediate fraction collected from 102\u00b0 to 275\u00b0. Succinimide then distils and is collected over the range 275\u2013289\u00b0, largely at 285\u2013289\u00b0. Decomposition takes place to a small extent with formation of a black tar; the distillation is stopped when the tarry residue begins to decompose with evolution of yellow fumes.\nThe crude succinimide, which solidifies completely, amounts to about 168 g. The intermediate fraction is redistilled from a smaller flask and furnishes about 10 g. more of crude succinimide boiling between 275\u00b0 and 289\u00b0. The two portions of crude succinimide are combined and crystallized from 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, employing 1 cc. of solvent for every gram of product. If the mixture is chilled to 0\u00b0 for some hours before filtration and about 25 cc. of cold alcohol is employed for washing the crystals, the first crop amounts to 163\u2013164 g. (82\u201383 per cent of the theoretical amount). On concentrating the mother liquor to one-third of its volume, a second crop of 4\u20135 g. can be secured (Note 2). The product melts at 123\u2013125\u00b0 and contains no water of crystallization."

            "(A) Preparation of Palladous Oxide.\u2014In a 350-cc. casserole, 2.2 g. (0.02 gram atom) of palladium metal is dissolved in a small amount of aqua regia, and the solution (Note 1) is treated with 55 g. of c. p. sodium nitrate and enough distilled water to make a thick paste. The substances are thoroughly mixed and then heated gently to drive off the water. The heating is increased until the mixture melts (about 270\u2013280\u00b0) and continued cautiously. Just above the melting point the mixture must be stirred and heated carefully as oxides of nitrogen are evolved and foaming occurs. After the evolution of gases is nearly complete (about five minutes) the full flame of a Bunsen burner is applied for about ten minutes. The entire time of heating should be about one-half hour. As the mass cools, the casserole is rotated to allow the melt to solidify on the sides of the dish. After digestion with about 200 cc. of distilled water until the sodium salts are completely dissolved, the dark brown precipitate of palladous oxide is filtered and washed thoroughly with 1 per cent sodium nitrate solution (Note 2). The oxide must not be washed with pure water since it shows a marked tendency to become colloidal. After drying in a vacuum desiccator the palladous oxide weighs 2.3\u20132.4 g. (91\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3).\n(B) Tetrahydrofuran.\u2014In the pressure bottle of an apparatus for catalytic reduction (Note 4) are placed 10 g. of pure furan (Note 5) and 0.2 g. of palladous oxide. The bottle is swept out with hydrogen (Note 6), and an initial hydrogen pressure of about 7 atm. (100 lb.) is applied (Note 7). After a lag of about ten minutes the reduction proceeds smoothly, and in an hour the theoretical amount of hydrogen is absorbed; the reaction is noticeably exothermic. After the reaction has ceased 20 g. of furan and 0.2 g. of palladous oxide are added (Note 6), the bottle swept out with hydrogen, and the hydrogen pressure raised to 7 atm. After this addition the lag is short and the reaction proceeds somewhat more rapidly than before; the temperature rises to 40\u201350\u00b0. When the reaction nears completion, 30 g. of furan and 0.2 g. of palladous oxide are added, and the reduction is continued. Successive portions of 30 g. of furan and 0.2 g. of palladous oxide are added in the same manner, until the bottle is about two-thirds filled. To ensure complete reduction, another portion of palladous oxide is added and the mixture shaken until no more hydrogen is taken up. The catalyst is allowed to settle (Note 8), and the tetrahydrofuran is decanted through a filter into a flask for distillation. The reduction product distils completely at 64\u201366\u00b0.\nThe reduction of 120 g. (128 cc., 1.76 moles) of furan requires about fifteen to twenty hours, depending upon the purity of the furan and the activity of the catalyst (Note 9). The yield of redistilled tetrahydrofuran is 114\u2013118 g. (90\u201393 per cent of the theoretical amount). Since reduction is practically quantitative, the yield is determined largely by the care exercised in handling the volatile furan and tetrahydrofuran."

In order to facilitate the process, the accumulated mass of crystals is removed from time to time by filtration. The time required for completion of the reaction varies from twelve to twenty-four hours. A crude yield of 176 g. (98 per cent of the theoretical amount) of fine, nearly colorless needles melting at 210\u2013213\u00b0 is obtained.\nThe product is purified by the inverted filtration method. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 20. A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and a bent glass tube, 8\u201310 mm. in diameter (Note 3). To the lower end of this tube is attached, by means of a cork, a 25-mm. tip prepared from a paper Soxhlet thimble and packed with glass wool. A 2-l. conical flask serves as a receiver for the hot filtrate.\nFig. 20\nThe crude product is placed in the round-bottomed flask, 1 l. of benzene is added, and heat is applied until the solvent boils vigorously. After a few minutes the source of heat is withdrawn and the mixture is allowed to become quiet. The filtering thimble, which up to this point is kept at the top of the flask (see Fig. 20), is now lowered to its normal position and the conical flask is attached. Gentle suction is applied, and the liquid is drawn over into the conical flask. The hot solution is removed, allowed to cool, and filtered. In the meantime, the extraction process is repeated with a second 1-l. portion of benzene. The two portions of benzene are used alternately over and over in the manner described until all the crude product has been recrystallized. This requires about ten separate extractions, using each 1-l. portion of benzene five times.\nThe yield of pure product, melting at 214\u2013215\u00b0, is 165\u2013169 g.

Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 119) and 52 g. (0.5 mole) of \u03b3-chlorobutyronitrile (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 156). The flask is heated in an oil bath maintained at 150\u2013180\u00b0 for one and one-half hours (Note 1) and then allowed to cool. The excess potassium phthalimide and the potassium chloride formed are removed by extraction with several portions of boiling distilled water until the wash water gives no test for chloride ion. The flask is then cooled and the product caused to solidify, and the remaining water is decanted as completely as possible. The solid is treated with 140 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the mixture is warmed gently in an oil bath under a reflux condenser until all the \u03b3-phthalimidobutyronitrile is brought into solution. Through the reflux condenser 200 cc. of distilled water is added carefully and the solution is refluxed vigorously for three hours. The mixture is cooled and allowed to stand overnight, and the phthalic acid is filtered. The filtrate is transferred to a large evaporating dish, 1 l. of distilled water is added, and then an excess of barium carbonate (about 550 g.) is added in small portions (Note 2). The mixture is evaporated nearly to dryness on the steam bath, and the residue is stirred throroughly with 1 l. of distilled water and again evaporated (Note 3). Finally 1 l. of distilled water is stirred with the solid and the mixture is filtered on a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The precipitate is washed with three 200-cc. portions of hot distilled water, and the filtrate and washings are concentrated to a volume of 200 cc. on the steam bath. After the addition of 2 g. of activated carbon the solution is filtered by suction, using a No. 42 Whatman paper, and the charcoal is washed with several small portions of hot distilled water. The filtrate is concentrated on the steam bath to the point of crystallization (about 75 cc.), and 375\u2013500 cc. of absolute alcohol is added to precipitate the amino acid. The mixture is stirred well so that the yellow impurities are retained in the solvent, and, after cooling, the colorless, crystalline product is collected and washed with absolute alcohol.\nThe alcoholic filtrate is evaporated to 50 cc., and 50 g. of barium hydroxide and 150 cc. of distilled water are added (Note 4). The mixture is refluxed for two hours and the excess barium hydroxide is precipitated with carbon dioxide. The barium carbonate is removed by filtration and washed with hot distilled water. A slight excess of sulfuric acid is added to the filtrate to liberate the amino acid from its barium salt, and an excess of barium carbonate is added to remove sulfate ion. The mixture is digested on the steam bath until effervescence ceases, and then it is filtered and the precipitate is washed with hot distilled water. The filtrate and washings are concentrated on the steam bath to a volume of 100 cc., decolorized with 1 g. of active carbon, filtered, and concentrated to the point of crystallization (about 25 cc.). The amino acid is precipitated by the addition of 150 cc. of absolute alcohol, and the product is collected and washed with absolute alcohol.\nThe combined yield is 24\u201332 g.

The lumps are broken up with a rod, and the mixture is stirred for about thirty minutes. At the end of this time, practically all the nitroso compound is dissolved and 1.2 l. of 5 N sodium hydroxide is added. Steam is passed in until the temperature of the mixture is 35\u00b0, and then the steam is shut off and 600 g. of technical sodium hydrosulfite (at least 85 per cent pure) is added while the solution is being stirred. The solution is stirred continuously for five minutes while the temperature rises to 60\u201365\u00b0, and then for one minute at five-minute intervals during one-half hour. At the end of about fifteen minutes the solution becomes clear and light yellow in color. A small amount of black scum floats on the surface.\nThe solution is now cooled to 20\u00b0 by the addition of about 1 kg. of ice and 500 cc. of technical concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.16) is added with stirring.

It is rapidly pressed as free from mother liquor as possible and transferred quickly (Note 3) to an 8-l.

Steam is introduced at such a rate that a temperature of 85\u201390\u00b0 is reached within ten minutes; the mixture is stirred at this temperature for one hour longer. The hot mixture is then filtered through a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filtrate is cooled to 35\u201340\u00b0 in an ice bath.\nThe claret-colored solution (5.2\u20135.8 l.) is filtered through a fluted filter paper in a 15-cm. funnel into 1.2 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in an 8-l. bottle. The aminonaphthol hydrochloride starts to precipitate immediately. The mixture is allowed to stand for at least two hours with occasional agitation to ensure complete precipitation. The hydrochloride is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed successively with three small portions of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid and three 50-cc. portions of ether (Note 4). It is then dried in the air in thin layers on filter paper. The yield is 180\u2013200 g. of anhydrous material (Note 5) (66\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount based on 200 g. of \u03b2-naphthol). The hydrochloride is unstable; in solution it decomposes rapidly, but this decomposition can largely be prevented by the addition of sodium bisulfite. The dry solid slowly changes and should be used within a few weeks of its preparation (Note 6).",
            "(A) Diazotization of Sulfanilic Acid.\u2014A mixture of 105 g. (0.5 mole) of sulfanilic acid dihydrate, 26.5 g. (0.25 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 500 cc. of water is heated and stirred until all the sulfanilic acid has dissolved, and the solution is then cooled in an ice bath to 15\u00b0 (sodium sulfanilate begins to crystallize at this temperature). A solution of 37 g. (0.54 mole) of sodium nitrite in 100 cc. of water is added and the resulting solution is poured at once onto a mixture of 106 cc. (1.25 moles) (Note 1) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) and 600 g. of ice contained in a 2-l. beaker. The solution, from which p-benzenediazonium sulfonate separates on stirring, is allowed to stand in an ice bath for fifteen to twenty-five minutes, during which time the naphthoxide solution is prepared.\n(B) Coupling: Orange II.\u2014Seventy-two grams of \u03b2-naphthol (0.5 mole) is dissolved in the warm solution obtained by dissolving 110 g. (2.75 moles) (Note 2) of sodium hydroxide in 600 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask, and the solution is cooled to about 5\u00b0 by the addition of 400 g. of ice. The suspension of the diazonium salt then is added and the mixture is stirred well and allowed to stand without external cooling for one hour (Note 3). The azo compound soon separates from the red solution and eventually forms a stiff paste.\n(C) Reduction: 1,2-Aminonaphthol Hydrochloride.\u2014The suspension of Orange II is heated to 45\u201350\u00b0, when all the material dissolves with slight evolution of gas. About one-tenth of 230 g. (about 1.1 moles) of technical sodium hydrosulfite (Note 4) is added cautiously and the mixture is stirred until the froth subsides; the remainder is then added without delay. The yellow material which first separates (probably the hydrazo compound) soon is converted into the nearly colorless aminonaphthol. In order to complete the reduction and to give an easily filterable product the mixture is heated strongly until it begins to froth; it is then cooled to 25\u00b0 by stirring in an ice bath, and the pink or cream-colored product is collected and washed free from the slightly yellow mother liquor with water.\nThe crude aminonaphthol is washed into a beaker containing a solution at 30\u00b0 of 2 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate and 53 cc. (0.63 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water. When the mixture is stirred the amine soon dissolves, leaving in suspension a small amount of fluffy material which is easily distinguishable from the original lumps (Note 5). The solution is clarified by stirring (without heating) for five minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, and it is then filtered by suction. The pale yellow solution is treated with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to the boiling point, a second 50 cc. of the acid being added as the heating progresses. The color becomes somewhat fainter during this process. The vessel containing the hot solution is transferred to an ice bath and allowed to cool undisturbed, and the 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride soon separates in the form of large, perfectly colorless needles. When fairly cold, 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 before collecting the product (Note 6). The hydrochloride is washed with a cold solution of 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 cc. of water and dried on a filter paper at a temperature not above 30\u201335\u00b0. The yield is 70\u201383 g. (72\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount). The material will remain colorless, or very nearly so, if protected from the light in storage. The fresh solution in water is only faintly colored and leaves but a trace of residue on filtration.\nAlthough this material is suitable for most purposes, it may be purified further in the following manner. It is dissolved by heating in a solution of 2 g. of stannous chloride and 2 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water, and the hot solution is clarified by filtration through a 5-mm. mat of decolorizing carbon (Note 7). The yellow or red color which may develop disappears on reheating to the boiling point. After the addition of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid the solution is allowed to cool in an ice bath, treated with a second 100 cc. of acid, cooled to 0\u00b0, and collected and washed as before. The crystalline product is colorless, ash-free, and of analytical purity. The loss in the crystallization of an 80-g. lot amounts to 5\u201310 g. (6\u201312 per cent)."

            "One hundred and five grams (0.5 mole) of sulfanilic acid dihydrate is diazotized exactly as described in the last paragraph of p. 35. While the suspension of p-benzenediazonium sulfonate is kept in an ice bath, 72 g. (0.5 mole) of \u03b1-naphthol (Note 1) is dissolved in the warm solution obtained by dissolving 110 g. (2.75 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 600 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask. The naphthoxide solution is cooled to 25\u00b0, 400 g. of ice is added, and the suspension of the diazonium salt is then introduced (Note 2). The mixture is stirred well and allowed to stand for one hour, during which time the formation of the dye, Orange I, goes to completion.\nThe deep purple-red solution of Orange I is warmed to 45\u201350\u00b0, about one-tenth of 230 g. (about 1.1 moles) of technical sodium hydrosulfite (Note 3) is added cautiously, and the mixture is stirred until the froth subsides; the remainder of the hydrosulfite is then added without delay. The tan suspension of the aminonaphthol is heated to about 70\u00b0 to effect sufficient coagulation to permit filtering. It is then cooled quickly to 25\u00b0 by stirring in an ice bath, and the precipitate is filtered and washed with fresh 1 per cent sodium hydrosulfite solution.\nThe crude aminonaphthol is transferred quickly to a beaker containing a solution of 2 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate and 63 cc. of hydrochloric acid in 800 cc. of water at 30\u00b0. On stirring and warming, the amine dissolves. The solution, which is usually a deep red, is filtered with suction; treatment with charcoal is not necessary. One hundred cubic centimeters of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, the solution is heated to boiling for five to ten minutes, and a second 100-cc. portion of the acid is added. During this heating the color fades to a light yellow, and on cooling to 0\u00b0 a mass of small, nearly colorless crystals is obtained.\nThis material (dry weight, 77\u201380 g.) (Note 4), without being dried, is dissolved by heating in a solution of 2 g. of stannous chloride and 2 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 700 cc. of water. The hot solution is clarified by filtration through a 5-mm. mat of decolorizing carbon. One hundred cubic centimeters of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the hot solution, which is then cooled in an ice bath, treated with a second 100-cc. portion of acid, and cooled to 0\u00b0. The precipitate is filtered and washed with a cold solution of 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 cc. of water. The 1,4-aminonaphthol hydrochloride forms small, nearly colorless needles of a high degree of purity. The solution in water is faintly pink, and the crystals may acquire a slight pink color after a few weeks. The yield is 70\u201373 g. (72\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5)."

            "Cyclohexene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 183, and p. 152 below) is boiled in the flask B, shown in Fig. 3, and the vapor is passed over a cracking element consisting of an expansible grid threaded with resistance ribbon L (Note 1) and (Note 2). The boiling flask B is supported over a 250-watt bowl heater provided with a rheostat, and the current in the cracking element is taken from a 115-volt a-c. or d-c. source and controlled by a second rheostat of 10-ampere capacity (Note 3). In order to trap any cyclohexene which passes the coil condenser, the gas-delivery tube D is connected to a tube leading close to the bottom of a 500-cc. distilling flask immersed in an ice bath. The exit tube of the flask is connected with a short section of rubber tubing to a receiver for condensing the butadiene, consisting of a large test tube with the entrance tube leading halfway to the bottom and an exit tube at the top for conducting the ethylene (saturated with butadiene) to a hood or outdoors. The receiver is cooled in a Dewar flask containing solid carbon dioxide and a eutectic mixture of equal parts by weight (or volume) of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.\nFig. 3\nThe flask B is two-thirds filled with cyclohexene, and, with the cooling water flowing, this is heated to vigorous boiling. When the vapor has displaced the air from the apparatus completely (Note 4), the current is turned on in the cracking unit. By adjusting both the rate of boiling and the current the ribbon is maintained at a bright red heat over its entire length. Very rapid refluxing is necessary in order to prevent undue carbonization on the filament and tar formation on the glass walls (Note 5). The generator can be run intermittently or until the charge is exhausted.\nThe butadiene collected is purified by a bulb-to-bulb distillation, the receiver in the cooling mixture being replaced by a similar container to which it is connected by means of rubber tubing and into which the butadiene is allowed to distil. The product is quite satisfactory for most uses, as in the Diels-Alder reaction (Note 6). The cracking element uses about 500 watts at 8.7 amperes and produces 25\u201330 g. of butadiene per hour. The yield, based on the cyclohexene consumed (Note 7) and on redistilled product, is 65\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount. High-boiling residues accumulating in the boiling flask should be removed after preparing 100\u2013150 g. of butadiene (Note 8)."

(1 mole) of ethyl adipate (p. 264) is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the addition is complete in about two hours. The reaction usually starts immediately on addition of the ethyl adipate. The temperature of the oil bath is maintained at 100\u2013115\u00b0 during the addition and for about five hours longer. Dry toluene is added through the condenser from time to time in order to keep the reaction mixture fluid enough for efficient stirring (Note 3).

The mixture becomes thin as the hydrolysis proceeds and the solvent acquires a slight color. After the time specified the crystalline solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with four 25-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40\u00b0. The weight of the nearly colorless crude cellobiose corresponds closely to the theoretical amount (34 g.). For purification it is dissolved in 125 cc. of hot water containing a few drops of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is clarified with 1\u20132 g. of Norite and filtered by suction.

            "In a 1-l. wide-mouthed bottle with a glass stopper, 400 cc. of acetic anhydride is cooled to \u221210\u00b0 in a freezing mixture and 36 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added at once with constant stirring. The temperature of the solution rises to about 20\u00b0. The bottle is removed from the freezing mixture, and 20 g. of absorbent cotton (Note 1) is worked into the liquor immediately with a heavy glass rod. With constant stirring, the bottle is warmed in a water bath maintained at 60\u00b0 until the temperature of the mixture reaches 45\u00b0 (about ten minutes), and then it is removed and the temperature is kept from rising above 55\u00b0 by suitable cooling with running water, stirring being continued throughout (Note 2). After about twenty minutes (total) the mixture becomes thin; at this point it is cooled to 50\u00b0 and a second 20-g. portion of cotton is added with stirring, the temperature again being kept from rising above 55\u00b0. The process of cooling to 50\u00b0 and adding 20 g. of cotton is repeated at intervals of about ten minutes until 100 g. of cotton in all has been introduced. After the final addition stirring is continued until the mixture becomes thin (about ten minutes); then the bottle is stoppered and heated in a bath maintained at 50\u00b0 for one hour, during which time the cotton dissolves completely to a thin, light brown syrup. The stoppered container is kept in an oven at 35\u00b0 for seven days.\nThe solution darkens to a deep wine-red color, and \u03b1-cellobiose octaacetate begins to crystallize on the second day (Note 3). After seven days at 35\u00b0 the semi-crystalline mass is stirred into 0 l. of cold water. With good stirring the flocculent precipitate of \u03b1-cellobiose octaacetate and cellulose-dextrin acetates soon becomes crystalline; after standing for one to two hours the solid is collected on a 12.5-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed free from acid with cold water, and drained thoroughly. The moist product, weighing about 250 g., is triturated with 250 cc. of warm methyl alcohol, and, after cooling to room temperature, the undissolved solid is collected on a 7-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with three 50-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40\u00b0. The yield of fairly pure \u03b1-cellobiose octaacetate is 69\u201374 g. For purification it is dissolved in 300 cc. of chloroform and the solution is filtered by suction into a dry receiver through a pad prepared by dusting Norite onto a B\u00fcchner funnel and washing the funnel with alcohol. The chloroform solution is filtered while the pad is still wet with alcohol, and the filter is washed at once with 100 cc. of chloroform without interruption in the filtration. The colorless filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure until the acetate begins to crystallize (about 250 cc.), the crystals are redissolved by warming, and the solution is poured into 750 cc. of warm methyl alcohol. The acetate begins to crystallize at once as small needles which eventually form a thick paste. The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 with stirring, and after about one hour the material is collected, washed with 100 cc. of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40\u00b0. The yield of colorless \u03b1-cellobiose octaacetate, m.p. 220\u2013222\u00b0, [\u03b1]20\u00b0D + 41.6\u00b0, is 65\u201369 g.

The yield of the pure acetate, m.p. 225\u2013226\u00b0, [\u03b1]20\u00b0D + 42.5\u00b0, is 61\u201365 g. The constants are not altered by further crystallizations."

About one hour is required for the addition of the sodium, and another hour for its complete solution. Toward the end of the reaction the flask may be heated with a small smoky flame. While the sodium is being dissolved, the following materials are weighed in dry, stoppered containers: 58 g. (1 mole) of dry acetone (Note 2), 150 g. (1.03 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261), and 160 g. (1.1 moles) of ethyl oxalate.\nAbout half of the sodium ethoxide solution is poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask provided with a liquid-sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser; the other half is kept warm by a small flame. The first half of the solution is allowed to cool until a solid begins to appear, then 58 g. of dry acetone mixed with 150 g. of ethyl oxalate is added at once and the stirrer is set in motion. Heat is evolved, and the liquid turns brown but remains clear. As soon as any turbidity appears, the other half of the hot sodium ethoxide solution is poured into the mixture together with 160 g. of ethyl oxalate, the two streams being allowed to mix as they flow into the flask. The liquid initially is clear and of a deep brown color, but after stirring for about thirty minutes the mixture becomes practically solid. The flask is then connected with a condenser for distillation and heated in an oil bath at 110\u00b0 until 150 cc. of alcohol has distilled. The flask is protected by a calcium chloride tube and the reaction mixture is cooled to 20\u00b0. The sodium derivative is removed to a 3-l. beaker by means of a glass rod and treated with a mixture of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 800 g. of cracked ice (Note 3). All lumps are carefully crushed, and the creamy yellow suspension of acetonedioxalic ester is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The ester is removed from the filter, stirred with about 100 cc. of ice water, and again collected (Note 4). For hydrolysis the crude material is heated with 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 5-l. flask (Note 5) on the steam bath for twenty hours. After cooling to 20\u00b0 the solid hydrated acid is collected on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 50-cc. portions of ice water, and dried, first at 100\u00b0 for two hours, and then at 160\u00b0 to constant weight to remove the water of crystallization. The yield of product decomposing at 257\u00b0 (corr.) is 140\u2013145 g. (76\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

Three hundred cubic centimeters of purified glacial acetic acid (Note 3) and 0.5 g. of platinum oxide are added, and the hydrogenation is conducted at 65\u201375\u00b0 at a slight positive pressure.

The total yield of air-dried, partially acetylated dihydrocholesterol, m.p. 130\u2013135\u00b0, is 85\u201390 g.\nUnless a specially purified product (see below) is desired, the crude material is heated for three hours on the steam bath with 400 cc. of alcohol and a solution of 25 g. of sodium hydroxide in 100 cc. of water. After cooling, the product is collected, washed, and crystallized from 500 cc. of alcohol. The yield is 75\u201380 g.

The reaction is complete in ten to fifty minutes. The solution is filtered, using ether to dissolve any crystallized material, and, after removing the solvent by distillation at reduced pressure, the residue is either saponified as above or purified in the following manner.\nPurification by the Method of Anderson and Nabenhauer.1\u2014A solution of 20 g. of crude, partially or completely acetylated dihydrocholesterol in 200 cc. of carbon tetrachloride is placed in a separatory funnel and treated with 100 cc. of acetic anhydride. About 5 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added dropwise through the stem of the inverted funnel with cooling and shaking until there is no further increase in color. A blue or green color develops, the intensity depending on the amount of cholesterol present in the sample. After fifteen to twenty minutes about 10 cc. of water is added, by drops and with cooling and gentle shaking until two distinct layers form. The carbon tetrachloride solution (upper layer) is separated and washed free of acid with sodium chloride or sodium carbonate solution (pure water gives emulsions). After drying with sodium sulfate, the solvent is removed by distillation at diminished pressure and the residue is saponified as above with alcoholic alkali and crystallized from alcohol. The purified dihydrocholesterol weighs 12\u201314 g. and melts, after thorough drying (Note 5), at 142\u2013143\u00b0.

The mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0 by means of an ice-water bath and maintained at 10\u201320\u00b0 during the addition of a solution of 120 g. (0.58 mole) of benzalacetophenone (Note 2) in 300 cc. of dry benzene. This addition requires about thirty minutes. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring continued at room temperature until all the dense, yellow precipitate formed at first has gone into solution (Note 3). The reaction is complete after stirring for an additional hour.\nThe bulk of the brown-colored benzene solution is decanted into a cold mixture of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1.5 l. of water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The remainder is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and the lumps of aluminum chloride are washed with two 100-cc. portions of benzene. The filtrates are added to the main solution and the whole is washed thoroughly with the dilute acid. If the layers do not separate readily the mixture is filtered with gentle suction and the water separated by siphoning. The solution is washed twice with 1.5-l. portions of water and filtered again if necessary.\nThe clear, light yellow benzene solution is subjected to rapid steam distillation (Note 4) in the same 5-l. flask, and when no more benzene passes over the flask is cooled under the tap with shaking. The residual oil solidifies to light brown pellets. These are collected, separated from water as much as possible, and dissolved in 2250 cc. of boiling alcohol. Five grams of decolorizing carbon is added; the hot solution is filtered with suction and allowed to cool. The best results are obtained if the alcoholic solution is stirred slowly with a mechanical stirrer while cooling to room temperature. Stirring is stopped when the mixture becomes semi-solid, and the mass is then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The fine, colorless needles are filtered on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible. The yield of thoroughly air-dried, colorless material melting at 91\u201392\u00b0 (Note 5) amounts to 125\u2013140 g. (76\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6)."

            "Sixty-nine grams (3 gram atoms) of sodium is powdered under xylene in a 3-l. three-necked flask. The mixture is cooled, the xylene is decanted, and the sodium is washed twice with small portions of dry ether. One liter of absolute ether is then added to the powdered sodium. The flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, an efficient reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, the condenser and the funnel being protected from moisture with calcium chloride tubes. One hundred and thirty-eight grams (175 cc., 3 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol is added drop by drop through the funnel (Note 1). After the alcohol has been added and there is no unchanged sodium (as evidenced by cessation of boiling) the flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and a mixture of 306 g. (3 moles) of ethyl propionate and 438 g. (3 moles) of ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261) is added slowly through the dropping funnel (Note 2).\nAfter the ester mixture has been added, the stirrer is removed and the condenser set for downward distillation. The ether and the alcohol formed in the reaction are removed by heating on a water bath (Note 3). The residue, which usually solidifies upon cooling, is treated with 600 cc. of cold, 33 per cent acetic acid solution. The mixture is allowed to stand for several hours with occasional shaking in order to decompose the sodium derivative completely, and the product is extracted with four 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether solution is washed with 1 l. of water, with two 500-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally with 1 l. of water. The ether is then removed by distillation, using a steam bath. The residue is fractionated through an efficient column (Note 4). The portion boiling at 114\u2013116\u00b0/10 mm. is collected.

The reaction proceeds smoothly and with evolution of heat, occasionally reaching the boiling point of the mixture. During the course of the reaction sodium bromide separates. When the addition of methyl bromide is complete, the solution is pale orange and faintly alkaline. It is boiled for an additional half-hour then neutralized with glacial acetic acid and cooled. The sodium bromide is filtered with suction and washed on the funnel with a little cold alcohol. The major part of the alcohol is then removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure (Note 4). The sodium bromide is dissolved in 600\u2013700 cc. of water containing 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution (Note 5) is added to the residue from the distillation and the mixture shaken well. The aqueous lower layer is separated from the ester and extracted twice with ether.

The ether is removed, and the ester is shaken for exactly one minute with a cold solution of 10 g. of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water (Note 6). The alkali is drawn off; the ester is washed with dilute acid and dried as before with calcium chloride. It is then distilled in vacuo, and the fraction boiling at 96\u00b0/16 mm. is taken. There is almost no fore-run or residue. The yield is 275\u2013290 g. (79\u201383 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

The tube is connected to a suitable trap for absorbing the large quantity of hydrogen bromide which is evolved. The flask is heated on a steam bath, and 500 g. (175 cc., 1.85 moles) of freshly distilled phosphorus tribromide (p. 359) is added cautiously from the dropping funnel. When this addition has been completed the steam bath is replaced by an oil bath and the temperature is raised gradually to 170\u2013180\u00b0 (Note 1). After heating at this temperature for twenty hours, the orange-red reaction mixture is transferred to a beaker containing 1 l. of cold water and stirred thoroughly to reduce the lumps to a small size. The red, flocculent material is filtered with suction and washed several times with hot water; finally it is washed thoroughly with two 200-cc. portions of cold 95 per cent ethyl alcohol (Note 2). After drying, the material is transferred to a large Soxhlet extractor and extracted exhaustively with 95 per cent alcohol (Note 3).

The condenser is set for distillation, the solvent is distilled, and the residue is washed into a hot B\u00fcchner funnel with hot water. The product is washed thoroughly on the funnel with boiling water, pressed well, and transferred to a large Soxhlet extractor. To remove impurities the material is extracted with boiling 95 per cent alcohol until a sample removed from the extraction thimble melts at 233\u00b0 (Note 6). The product is then removed from the thimble and dried; the yield is 66\u201373 g. (89\u201398 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude product may be recrystallized from hot benzene, using about 18 cc. of solvent per gram. The recovery is about 80 per cent, and the melting point is not changed."

            "In a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask are placed 250 g. (4 moles) of ammonium formate (Note 1), 150 g. (1.25 moles) of acetophenone (Note 2), and a few chips of porous plate. The flask is fitted with a cork carrying a thermometer extending nearly to the bottom, and the side arm is connected to a small condenser set for distillation. On heating the flask with a small flame the mixture first melts to two layers and distillation occurs; at 150\u2013155\u00b0 it becomes homogeneous and reaction takes place with moderate foaming. The heating is continued, more slowly if necessary, until the temperature reaches 185\u00b0. During this process water, acetophenone, and ammonium carbonate distil; about three hours is required and little attention is necessary. At 185\u00b0 the heating is stopped and the upper layer of acetophenone is separated from the distillate and returned, without drying, to the reaction flask. The mixture is then heated for three hours at 180\u2013185\u00b0. The distillate is extracted with 25\u201330 cc. of benzene to recover acetophenone (Note 3), and the aqueous portion is discarded.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled and then shaken in a 500-cc. separatory funnel with 150\u2013200 cc. of water to remove ammonium formate and formamide. The crude \u03b1-phenylethylformamide is drawn off into the original flask, and the water layer is extracted with two 30-cc. portions of benzene and discarded. The benzene extracts are united with the main portion, and 150 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, together with a few pieces of porous plate. The mixture is cautiously heated until the benzene has distilled and then boiled gently for forty to fifty minutes longer. Hydrolysis proceeds rapidly, and the mixture becomes homogeneous except for a small layer of acetophenone and other neutral substances. The mixture is cooled and extracted first with 50 cc. of benzene and then with three or four 25-cc. portions of the solvent. The extracts are saved for the recovery of acetophenone (Note 3).\nThe aqueous acid solution is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a separatory funnel and equipped for steam distillation. A solution of 125 g. of sodium hydroxide in 250 cc. of water is added through the funnel, and the mixture is distilled with steam (Note 4). The first liter of distillate contains most of the amine, but the distillate should be collected until it is only faintly alkaline. A small residue containing di-(\u03b1-phenylethyl)-amine and neutral substances remains in the flask and may be discarded.\nThe distillate is extracted with five 50-cc. portions of benzene, and the benzene solution is dried thoroughly with powdered sodium hydroxide and distilled (Note 5). Most of the amine distils at 184\u2013186\u00b0, but the fraction distilling at 180\u2013190\u00b0 is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 6). The yield of this fraction is 80\u201388 g. By combining the benzene fore-run with the distillation residue, extracting with dilute acid, and recovering the amine as above, an additional 10\u201312 g. of material can be obtained (Note 7), making the total yield 90\u2013100 g. (60\u201366 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the acetophenone taken) (Note 8)."

            "d-\u03b1-Phenylethylamine.\u2014A solution of 100 g. (0.75 mole) (Note 1) of l-malic acid in 500 cc. of distilled water is mixed with 120 g. (1 mole) of dl-\u03b1-phenylethylamine (p. 503); the resulting solution is heated for a short time on the steam bath, filtered into a 1-l. beaker, and allowed to cool slowly. After several hours the crude d-\u03b1-phenylethylamine-l-malate which crystallizes is collected by suction filtration and washed on the filter with 25 cc. of ice water. The filtrate and washings are evaporated on a steam bath to a volume about two-thirds that of the original filtrate, and a second crop of crystals is obtained on cooling (Note 2) and (Note 3). By repeating the process it is possible to obtain a third and usually a fourth crop, after which the mother liquor becomes too viscous to permit satisfactory crystallization. The mother liquor is reserved for later use.\nThe successive crops of crystals are systematically recrystallized as follows, using Norite if necessary. About two-thirds of the first crop is dissolved in about three parts of water and the hot solution allowed to deposit crystals by slow cooling (Note 3). The liquor is filtered or decanted, the remainder of the first crop is dissolved in it, and the process of crystallization is repeated. The remaining crops are then similarly recrystallized in succession from the same liquor, the solution being evaporated to the appropriate volume before each crystallization. The final mother liquor is evaporated in stages, and the viscous residue is united with that from the original crystallization. The various crops are systematically recrystallized from fresh water until pure (Note 4). It is possible to obtain 80\u201390 g. (63\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) of the pure d-base-l-acid (anhydrous acid salt).\nThe pure malate (mol. wt. 255) is decomposed by warming with very slightly more (Note 5) than two equivalents of approximately 2 N sodium hydroxide. The amine is extracted, after cooling, with three or four 25-cc. portions of pure benzene, the solution is dried thoroughly with powdered sodium hydroxide, and the pure amine, b.p. 184\u2013185\u00b0, [\u03b1]25\u00b0D + 39.2\u00b0 to + 39.7\u00b0 (without solvent), is obtained by distillation (Note 6). A small amount of the amine distils with the benzene. The yield is 35\u201340 g. (92\u201394 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the pure malate).\nThe mother liquors from the original crystallization and recrystallizations are treated in a similar manner, and the sodium malate solutions are united and reserved for the recovery of l-malic acid (Note 7). The recovered amine amounts to 75\u201380 g. and contains 40\u201350 per cent excess l-amine.\nl-\u03b1-Phenylethylamine.\u2014The recovered amine is converted to the acid tartrate in water solution, using for each gram of amine 1.25 g. of d-tartaric acid and 4.0 cc. of water. The solution is boiled with decolorizing carbon, if necessary, filtered, and allowed to cool slowly without disturbance (Note 3). A dense mass of coarse crystals of crude l-\u03b1-phenylethylamine-d-tartrate is deposited. The solution is decanted and evaporated to about two-thirds its original volume, and a second crop of crystals is obtained as before. These operations are repeated once or twice more, after which usually no more coarse crystals, but only a mass of needle-like crystals (mixed salts), can be obtained (Note 8). Meanwhile the first crop is recrystallized from about twice its weight of water. About two-thirds of the weight of crude salt is thus obtained pure; the mother liquor is used as solvent for the second crop, and so forth. The final mother liquor is united with that from the original crystallization and reserved for the recovery of the partially resolved amine. The yield of pure l-base-d-acid salt (anhydrous acid salt) is 75\u2013100 g., an amount equivalent to somewhat more than the excess of l-amine in the mixture taken. The pure salt has a specific rotation of +13.0 to 13.2\u00b0 in an 8 per cent solution in water.\nThe pure salt (mol. wt. 271) is dissolved in four parts of water; the amine is liberated with an excess of 20\u201325 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, extracted with benzene, and purified as described for the d-amine. The constants agree closely with those given for the d-amine, and the yield is 32\u201342 g. (94\u201396 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the pure tartrate, or 53\u201370 per cent based on the total l-amine originally present).\nThe amine recovered in the same way from the mother liquors amounts to 40\u201350 g. and contains a slight excess of d-amine. It may be used conveniently in the next run in place of the dl-amine."

The upper end of the reflux condenser is connected to a 150-cc. distilling flask cooled in an ice-salt mixture to trap material entrained by the hydrogen chloride.\nThe tetrahydrofuran is heated to the boiling point (64\u201365\u00b0), and a slow stream of hydrogen chloride is bubbled into the liquid. As the reaction proceeds the temperature of the boiling liquid increases, slowly at first and then more rapidly, until it is above 100\u00b0 (after about four hours' heating). At the end of about five hours the temperature remains practically constant in the range 103.5\u2013105.5\u00b0, and the reaction is stopped. The light brown liquid is cooled, transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask having a 20-cm. fractionating side arm, and fractionated at reduced pressure, using a water aspirator. A large quantity of hydrogen chloride is evolved at the start of the distillation and a low pressure cannot be obtained until this has been removed. Throughout the fractionation a trap cooled to \u221215\u00b0 in an ice-salt mixture is used to collect the recovered tetrahydrofuran.\nAfter removal of a small amount of low-boiling material the main fraction distils in the range 80\u201390\u00b0/14 mm. or 65\u201375\u00b0/7 mm.

When the reaction moderates the flask is cooled and 300 cc. of ether, dried twenty-four hours with calcium chloride, is added through the condenser.

The acid salt is then dissolved in 240 cc. of water to which 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid has been added, and the solution is extracted with five 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are evaporated to dryness on a steam bath, leaving pure hydrated crystals of acetylenedicarboxylic acid. After drying for two days over concentrated sulfuric acid in a vacuum desiccator the crystals decompose sharply at 175\u2013176\u00b0. The yield is 30\u201336 g.

(5.05 moles) of allyl isothiocyanate (Note 2). The mixture is refluxed over a free flame until the upper layer of allyl isothiocyanate has completely disappeared, about fifteen hours being required for the hydrolysis. When the reaction is complete, the solution is poured into a 3-l. beaker and concentrated on the steam bath until crystals begin to form in the hot solution. This occurs when the volume is approximately 400 cc. (Note 3).\nThe warm residue is then diluted with water to a volume of 500\u2013550 cc. and placed in a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-cc. dropping funnel, a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a condenser arranged for distillation. The lower end of the condenser is fitted to a receiver consisting of a 500-cc. suction flask, whose side arm is connected to a reflux condenser (Note 4). The receiver is placed in an ice-salt bath and the three-necked flask in a water bath. The temperature of the water bath is raised to 95\u201398\u00b0, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 400 g. (7.1 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 250 cc. of water is added dropwise from the funnel. As soon as the free hydrochloric acid is neutralized, the amine begins to distil. The rate of the addition of the alkali is regulated so as to maintain a dropwise distillation of allylamine and, after the addition is complete, heating and stirring are continued until all the amine has distilled.\nThe distillate is then dried over solid potassium hydroxide for twenty-four hours and finally over metallic sodium (Note 5). The allylamine is distilled from a water bath held at 70\u201378\u00b0, through a 12-in. fractionating column, into a receiver immersed in an ice bath. Two fractions are collected: up to 54\u00b0/746 mm., and 54\u201357\u00b0/746 mm. The lower fraction amounts to 14\u201316 g. and on redistillation yields 6\u20138 g. of pure material.

The flask is then equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel, and cooled, with stirring, to \u221210\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath. When this temperature has been reached, the benzidine dihydrochloride is tetrazotized over a period of two hours with a solution of 232 g. (3.2 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water, until a faint test for nitrous acid with starch-iodide paper is obtained after twenty minutes. During this reaction, the temperature is kept below \u22125\u00b0.\nConcurrently with the tetrazotization, 104 g. (1.68 moles) of boric acid is dissolved in 222 g. (6.66 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid. The solution is made in a 1-l. beaker, which has been coated inside with paraffin, and is cooled in an ice bath. The boric acid is added slowly in small portions, and the mixture is stirred with a lead rod. It is necessary to keep the temperature below 20\u201325\u00b0 in order that the heat of solution may not melt the paraffin from the walls of the beaker (Note 1).\nThe ice-cold fluoboric acid solution is added rather rapidly, with stirring, to the finished tetrazo solution, the temperature being kept below 10\u00b0. A thick paste of 4,4'-biphenylene-bis-diazonium borofluoride forms. The mixture is stirred at 10\u00b0 for twenty to thirty minutes. It is then collected on a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed consecutively with about 200 cc. of cold water, 200 cc. of cold commercial methyl alcohol, and 200 cc. of commercial ether; the cake is sucked as dry as possible between washings.

The product decomposes at 135\u2013137\u00b0.\nA 1-l. distilling flask with a wide side arm may be used for the decomposition of the tetrazonium borofluoride. A 500-cc. distilling flask is fastened directly to the side arm of the decomposition flask and cooled with running water. To the side arm of the receiver is connected a rubber tube which is placed over 2 l. of water in a 5-l. flask (Note 2). The solid to be decomposed (Note 3) is placed in the decomposition flask and heated at the upper edge with a Bunsen burner. When white fumes begin to be evolved, the burner is removed and the decomposition permitted to continue spontaneously. More heat is applied as needed. Finally vigorous heating is employed to ensure complete decomposition. Some 4,4'-difluorobiphenyl is collected in the receiver, but the larger portion remains in the decomposition flask, from which it is recovered by steam-distilling the black residue. A second steam distillation gives a pure white compound melting at 88\u201389\u00b0, after drying in an oven at 60\u201370\u00b0. When 153 g. of the tetrazonium borofluoride is decomposed in this manner, 61\u201362 g. of 4,4'-difluorobiphenyl is obtained (80\u201381.5 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the tetrazonium borofluoride; 54\u201356 per cent based on the benzidine used)."

Crystallization from 100 cc. of benzene with the addition of 75 cc. of ligroin (b.p. 60\u201380\u00b0) gives 34\u201341 g. of pale yellow prisms, m.p. 125\u2013126\u00b0 (Note 6)."

            "(A) Diphenylselenium Dichloride.\u2014One hundred twenty-five grams (0.53 mole) of diphenyl selenide (p. 238) is added in portions to 250 cc. (4 moles) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) in a 1.5-l. beaker. Hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is then added until precipitation is complete. About 170 cc. (2 moles) of acid is required. The mixture is then diluted with 500 cc. of water, and the yellow precipitate is separated by filtration and air-dried. The crude product is purified by extracting with 500 cc. of boiling benzene. The crystals which separate on cooling are collected on a filter and the filtrate is used for a further extraction. Three such treatments are necessary for a complete crystallization. The yield of yellow needles, decomposing at 187\u2013188\u00b0, is 137\u2013141 g. (85\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Triphenylselenonium Chloride.\u2014To 87 g. (100 cc., 1.1 moles) of benzene in a 1-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, is added 30 g. (0.22 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The suspension is cooled in an ice bath, and to it is added, with stirring, 40 g. (0.13 mole) of diphenylselenium dichloride in portions of approximately 1 g. at a time over a period of twenty-five minutes. Before each addition the temperature should be below 10\u00b0 to prevent the final product from becoming dark. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for three hours at room temperature, and then 200 cc. of water is added cautiously (Note 1). The benzene layer is separated and discarded. If the water layer is colored, further extractions with benzene will remove most of the color without reducing the yield. The water layer is then extracted three times with 50-cc. portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are concentrated to a volume of 40 cc. and treated with 120 cc. of ether (Note 2). A yellow oil precipitates and solidifies almost at once to a white powder. The triphenylselenonium chloride is collected on a filter and recrystallized from 300 cc. of methyl ethyl ketone to which 20 cc. of water has been added (Note 3). The yield of anhydrous product, after drying at 100\u00b0, is 30 g. (67 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4)."

            "(A) Preparation of Ethyl Benzoylacetoacetate.\u2014In a 5-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser, are placed 3.4 l. of dry benzene (Note 1), 195 g. (1.5 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 235), and 34.5 g. (1.5 gram atoms) of clean sodium. The mixture is heated on a steam cone with stirring and allowed to reflux gently for twenty-four hours. After the suspension of the sodioacetoacetic ester has been cooled slightly, 263 g. (218 cc., 1.9 moles) of benzoyl chloride is added over a period of three hours. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional eight hours. It is then cooled to room temperature, and 375 g. of cracked ice is added. After thorough shaking, the benzene layer, which contains the ethyl benzoylacetoacetate, is separated, washed with 75 cc. of 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, dried with sodium sulfate, and the benzene distilled (Note 2). The residue is distilled in vacuo from a 500-cc. Claisen flask with a 50-cm. fractionating side arm. After a small fore-run of benzoyl chloride, the fraction boiling at 142\u2013148\u00b0/6 mm., or 177\u2013181\u00b0/20 mm., is collected. The yield is 223\u2013263 g.

The ether is distilled, and the residue distilled in vacuo; the yield is 37.0\u201337.5 g.

        "Procedure": [
            "The apparatus consists of a 1-l. three-necked flask with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and a 6-mm. inlet tube reaching to the bottom of the flask. In the third neck is a cork bearing a low-temperature thermometer and a tube containing phosphorus pentoxide on glass wool, and calcium chloride. The inlet tube is connected to three 20-cm. drying towers, two containing phosphorus pentoxide on glass wool, and one containing calcium chloride. To the last tower is connected a 2-l. Florence flask fitted as a wash bottle with a safety tube and containing 1 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The Florence flask is connected to the hydrogen chloride generator described in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 293, in which a single charge of 1.5 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 800 cc. of hydrochloric acid is sufficient for this preparation. A pressure equalizer should be provided between the generating flask and the funnel.\nAfter the inlet tube is removed from the reaction flask, 400 cc. of absolute alcohol (Note 1) and 161 g. (1 mole) of dry \u03b1-phenylacetoacetonitrile (m.p. 88.5\u201389.5\u00b0) (p. 487) are added. The neck is temporarily closed by a cork, and the nitrile is dissolved by warming with stirring. The flask is then surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the solution vigorously stirred, so that any nitrile which crystallizes will be finely divided. When the temperature reaches \u221210\u00b0, the inlet tube is inserted and a stream of dry hydrogen chloride passed through, with moderate stirring, at such a rate that the bubbles rising from the 6-mm. tubing in the sulfuric acid wash bottle can just be counted. This is continued for five to eight hours until the mixture is saturated (Note 2). The ice bath is then removed, stirring continued until all the solid has dissolved (about one hour), and the flask allowed to stand overnight (Note 3).\nMost of the excess hydrogen chloride is removed by adding porous tile and evacuating the flask with a water pump for a half hour, while it is surrounded by a water bath maintained at about 40\u00b0. Two hundred grams of sodium carbonate is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water in a 5-l. flask, and 2 l. of cracked ice added. Into this solution the reaction mixture is poured in a thin stream with vigorous shaking, and the solution is extracted at once with three 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are washed countercurrently with four 250-cc. portions of ice-cold 5 per cent sodium chloride solution to remove the alcohol and then combined in a 3-l. flask placed in an ice bath.\nA solution of 100 g. of c.p. concentrated sulfuric acid in 700 cc. of water is prepared in a 5-l. flask, 1.5 l. of cracked ice added, and the mixture shaken until ice forms on the outside of the flask. After about half of this solution has been poured into the cold ether solution of the imino ether, using a funnel to remove the excess ice, the mixture is shaken for exactly fifteen seconds (Note 4), allowed to settle, and the layers separated. The remaining acid is added to the ether layer in two portions, the mixture each time being shaken for fifteen seconds, and separated. Since the ether solution, although now free of the imino ether, still contains a small amount of ethyl phenylacetoacetate, it is saved to be combined with the main portion later.\nThe sulfuric acid solution of the imino ether sulfate quickly turns cloudy because of the separation of ethyl \u03b1-phenylacetoacetate. To complete the hydrolysis, the mixture is heated on the steam bath for one-half hour at the temperature at which the ether just boils (about 50\u00b0) (Note 5). It is then cooled, the ester layer separated, and the acid extracted once with 250 cc. of ether. The ether solution is washed once with 100 cc. of water which is recombined with the acid. The acid solution is replaced on the steam bath and heated for forty-five minutes after the temperature reaches 80\u201390\u00b0. After the solution is cooled and extracted as before, all ether extracts, including the original from which the imino ether was removed, are combined and washed once with 250 cc. of 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, once with 250 cc. of water, and then dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 6). The sodium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with ether, the ether removed from the filtrates, and the residue fractionated in vacuo from a 250-cc. Claisen flask having a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The main fraction boils at 139\u2013143\u00b0/12 mm., or 130\u2013134\u00b0/5 mm., and weighs 103\u2013167 g. (50\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount). By fractional distillation of the fore-run, main fraction, and residue, a product boiling over a one- to two-degree range may be obtained with no change in the yield (Note 7)."

            "In each of two ordinary 250-cc. (8-oz.) narrow-mouthed bottles are placed 32.1 g. (0.3 mole) of m-toluidine and 33 g. (23 cc., 0.3 mole) of ethyl bromide (Note 1). The bottles are sealed with rubber stoppers wired tightly in place and then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours in a 2-l. beaker filled with water at room temperature (Note 2). The white crystalline mass in each bottle is broken up and the amine is liberated by shaking with 150 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 50 cc. of ether. The contents of the two flasks are combined, the lower aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the ether solution of the amine is washed with 150 cc. of water. When the ether is distilled from a steam bath, the crude amine (90\u201392 g.) is obtained.\nThis crude amine is added, with cooling, to a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) in 350 cc. of water. The solution of the hydrochloride is cooled in an ice bath, and stirred rapidly, while a solution of 41.5 g. (0.6 mole) of sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is added slowly. During this addition the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 12\u00b0. After all the nitrite has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand for ten minutes and is then extracted with three 100-cc. portions of ether. The ether is evaporated from the extract by warming gently on a steam bath and blowing a stream of air over the surface. Care must be taken to keep the temperature as low as possible during the evaporation (Note 3).\nThe crude nitroso compound is added gradually, with continuous shaking, to a solution of 407 g. (1.8 moles) of stannous chloride dihydrate in 420 cc. (4.8 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) contained in a 3-l. flask. The reaction is exothermic, and cooling is applied, if necessary, to keep the temperature below 60\u00b0. After standing for at least an hour (Note 4), the mixture is made strongly alkaline by the cautious addition of a cold solution of 520 g. (13 moles) of sodium hydroxide in about 800 cc. of water. During the addition of the alkali the mixture is agitated vigorously and cooled in running water.\nThe resulting milky suspension is distilled with steam until about 2 l. of distillate has collected. The distillate is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with three 100-cc. portions of benzene. The extract is dried thoroughly overnight with flaked potassium hydroxide and decanted from the spent drying agent. After removal of the solvent by distillation, the amine is distilled under reduced pressure. Practically all the material distils at 111\u2013112\u00b0/20 mm., or 115.5\u2013117\u00b0/26 mm. The pure amine forms a practically colorless, highly refringent liquid and weighs 51\u201353 g. (63\u201366 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5). It develops color rapidly on standing."

            "In a large round-bottomed flask are placed 1.4 kg. of dried blood corpuscle paste (Note 1) and 4.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The flask is warmed on a steam bath until the protein has dissolved, and the mixture is boiled gently under reflux for eighteen to twenty hours. After the hydrolysate has been concentrated under reduced pressure to a thick paste, the distillation is continued with the slow addition of a liter of water, thus eliminating most of the excess hydrochloric acid. The residue is taken up in 8 l. of warm water, cooled, and neutralized to pH 4.4\u20134.6 (methyl orange or bromcresol green) by the addition of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (Note 2). After the mixture has stood overnight, the precipitated pigment is removed by filtering through a large B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with two layers of filter paper and a 2-mm. layer of infusorial earth. The filtrate, which is dull red in color, is decolorized by warming and stirring for ten minutes with 60 g. of Norite.\nThe pale yellow filtrate and washings from the Norite are diluted to 25 l. with tap water, and a solution of 600 g. of mercuric chloride in 2 l. of hot 95 per cent alcohol is added, with stirring. A concentrated solution of sodium carbonate (corresponding to about 350 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate) is added slowly, with stirring, until the mixture reaches pH 7.0\u20137.5 (phenol red or litmus). After settling for several hours, preferably overnight, the supernatant liquid is siphoned off, and the crock is refilled with water to the original volume (Note 3). The mixture is allowed to settle, the wash liquid siphoned off, and the precipitate washed twice more in the same fashion. After the third washing, the supernatant liquid is siphoned off and the precipitate collected with suction on a large B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with two layers of filter paper and a 2-mm. layer of infusorial earth.\nThe moist histidine-mercury complex is suspended in 5 l. of water and stirred vigorously while a stream of hydrogen sulfide is introduced. When precipitation of mercuric sulfide is complete, the suspension becomes uniformly black and settles sharply on standing. The filtrate and washings from the mercuric sulfide (Note 4) are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 1 l. and cleared with 5 g. of Norite. The filtrate and washings from the Norite are concentrated further to a volume of about 250 cc. and mixed with three volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. Crystallization is induced by cooling the solution and scratching the walls of the vessel; the histidine monohydrochloride separates in plates. After the material has remained in an ice chest for three or four days, the crystals are separated by suction filtration. The yield of crude histidine monohydrochloride is 85\u201390 g. The filtrate, on standing for several weeks in an ice chest, usually deposits an additional 4\u20135 g. of material.\nThe crude product is dissolved in five times its weight of water, and, after clearing with a little Norite, the solution is diluted with one and one-half volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. The product separates in well-formed, snow-white crystals, and after standing for several days in an ice chest is collected with suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The yield of purified histidine monohydrochloride is 75\u201380 g. (Note 5). The compound melts at 251\u2013252\u00b0, with decomposition. The amino acid is not racemized by the procedure employed, and it shows the characteristic optical activity, [\u03b1]D26\u00b0 = +8.0\u00b0, in the presence of three moles of hydrochloric acid. The recrystallized product is usually analytically pure and shows the correct Van Slyke amino nitrogen content. Occasionally a second recrystallization is necessary to obtain analytically pure material."

While the temperature of the liquid is kept at 5\u201310\u00b0, dry hydrogen chloride is passed in at a moderate rate until 24\u201327 g. of the gas has been absorbed. The addition takes from eight to ten hours and requires little attention from the operator. The crude \u03b1-chlorohydrindene is then transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask and distilled at diminished pressure. After a small fore-run (5\u201310 g.) containing indene, \u03b1-chlorohydrindene boiling at 90\u2013103\u00b0/15 mm. is collected; the yield is 80\u201390 g. (Note 2).\nIn a 500-cc. three-necked flask, fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel, is placed 100 g. (1 mole) of chromic anhydride dissolved in 100 cc. of water, and 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added. The \u03b1-chlorohydrindene is then admitted through the funnel at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 35\u201340\u00b0, the flask being cooled externally. This addition takes about one and one-half hours; after it is complete, stirring is continued for fifteen minutes before the mixture is poured into a large beaker and diluted with 300 cc. of water. After the acid present is neutralized by the addition of solid sodium carbonate (Note 3), the \u03b1-hydrindone is expelled from the mixture by steam distillation, care being taken to avoid entrainment of froth at the beginning of the process. When about 2.5 l. of distillate has been collected, the solution again begins to froth. The operation is stopped at this point, since further distillation does not yield an appreciable quantity of product. The \u03b1-hydrindone usually solidifies, as soon as the distillate is chilled, to a mixture of colorless crystals and a yellow solid; the product is collected after thorough cooling in an ice bath. This moist solid is dissolved in 200 cc. of benzene, and the solution is subjected to distillation until free from water. After the benzene is removed by vacuum distillation on the steam bath, the \u03b1-hydrindone is distilled. It boils at 125\u2013126\u00b0/17 mm., and the distillate is a pale yellow solid, m.p. 39\u201341\u00b0. The yield is 46\u201355 g.

(2.7 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and again cooled to room temperature. Meanwhile, 294 g. (6 moles) of sodium cyanide (97 per cent) is dissolved in 750 cc. of water warmed to 55\u00b0; the solution is cooled to room temperature and then added to the sodium chloroacetate solution, with rapid mixing of the two solutions and cooling under the water tap. When the solutions are completely mixed, cooling is stopped and the temperature allowed to rise. When it reaches 95\u00b0, the solution is cooled by adding 200 cc. of ice water, and this is repeated, if necessary, until the temperature no longer rises (Note 2). The solution is then heated on the steam bath for one hour to ensure completion of the reaction.\nAt the end of this time, the solution is cooled to room temperature and 240 g. (6 moles) of solid u.s.p. sodium hydroxide is slowly dissolved in it. When solution is complete, the reaction mixture is again heated on the steam bath under a hood. When the temperature reaches 60\u201370\u00b0, evolution of ammonia begins and becomes more vigorous with rise in temperature. Most of the ammonia is evolved in forty-five minutes, but the solution is heated for at least three hours, and the last traces of ammonia are removed by bubbling steam through the hot solution for forty-five to sixty minutes more.\nA solution of 600 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride in 1.8 l. of water warmed to 40\u00b0 is added slowly with rapid mixing to the hot sodium malonate solution. A cheese-like precipitate of calcium malonate is formed immediately and becomes coarsely crystalline on standing for twenty-four hours. After the supernatant solution is decanted, the calcium malonate is washed by decantation four or five times with 500-cc. portions of cold water. It is then transferred to a filter, sucked as dry as possible, and dried in the air, or at 45\u201350\u00b0, to constant weight. The yield is 800\u2013900 g.\nThe dry calcium malonate is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask with sufficient (750\u20131000 cc.) alcohol-free ether (Note 3) to make a paste which can be stirred. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the well-stirred salt is treated with 1 cc. of 12 N hydrochloric acid for each gram of salt. After the acid has been added slowly through a dropping funnel, the solution is transferred to a continuous extractor (Note 4) and extracted with ether until no more malonic acid is obtained. The product, as obtained from the undried ether solution by concentration, filtration, and drying in the air, melts at 130\u00b0 or higher and is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The yield is 415\u2013440 g. (75\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

        "Procedure": [
            "The reaction is carried out in the apparatus shown in Fig. 13. A-A is a Pyrex combustion tube, 90 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter, fitted with an inlet chamber B, having a sealed-in side arm C and bearing a separatory funnel E. The center 60 cm. of the tube is filled with thorium oxide catalyst (Note 1) held in place at the lower end by indentations in the combustion tube. The hot junction D of a pyrometer is placed in contact with the glass tube at its center, and the catalyst-filled section of the tube is wrapped with a thin layer of asbestos paper. The tube is supported in an electrically heated cylindrical furnace, 60 cm. in length, which is inclined slightly from the horizontal. The annular space between the tube and the furnace is plugged at the ends with asbestos in order to produce a uniform temperature throughout the tube and to hold the glass tube in place. The lower end of the reaction tube is connected through the adapter F to a vertical glass tube G, 40 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter, which is filled with glass beads and serves as the condenser. An Erlenmeyer flask or other suitable receiver is placed at the lower end of G.\nFig. 13\nThe furnace is heated to 430\u2013450\u00b0, and simultaneously the tube is swept out thoroughly with a stream of carbon dioxide, introduced through the side arm C. The carbon dioxide is passed through a wash bottle of concentrated sulfuric acid to dry it and to estimate the rate of flow. A solution of 136 g. (1 mole) of phenylacetic acid, m.p. 77\u201379\u00b0 (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), in 120 cc. (120 g., 2 moles) of glacial acetic acid is placed in the separatory funnel E and is introduced into the inlet chamber B at the rate of twelve to fifteen drops per minute. The entire solution should run through in twelve to fifteen hours. Meanwhile a very slow stream of carbon dioxide (one bubble per second) is passed through the tube C, to keep the gases in motion. After all the solution has been added, the funnel is rinsed with 10 cc. of glacial acetic acid, and this is passed through the reaction tube to facilitate removal of the product. The distillate consists of a slightly fluorescent light brown oil and an aqueous layer; both layers are treated with 300 g. of a mixture of ice and water, and rendered alkaline to litmus with a slight excess of 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (Note 2).\nThe oil is separated (Note 3), and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-cc. portions of benzene. The extracts are combined with the oil, and the solvent is removed by distillation. Fractionation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 80\u201395 g. of a methyl benzyl ketone fraction, boiling at 110\u2013120\u00b0/21\u201322 mm., and a residue of dibenzyl ketone (Note 4). The main fraction on redistillation yields 74\u201387 g. (55\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount) of methyl benzyl ketone boiling at 110\u2013115\u00b0/21\u201322 mm. (Note 5), (Note 6), and (Note 7).",
            "Three hundred fifty cubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid is placed in a 3-l. flask and cooled to \u221210\u00b0. The total first crop of moist \u03b1-phenylacetoacetonitrile obtained according to the procedure on p. 487 (corresponding to 188\u2013206 g., or 1.2\u20131.3 moles of dry product) is added slowly, with shaking, the temperature being kept below 20\u00b0 (Note 1). After all is added the flask is warmed on the steam bath until solution is complete and then for five minutes longer. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0, 1750 cc. of water added rapidly, and the flask placed on a vigorously boiling water bath and heated for two hours, with occasional shaking. The ketone forms a layer and, after cooling, is separated and the acid layer extracted with 600 cc. of ether. The oil and ether layers are washed successively with 100 cc. of water, the ether combined with the oil and dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is collected on a filter, washed with ether, and discarded. The ether is removed from the filtrates, and the residue distilled from a modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The fraction boiling at 109\u2013112\u00b0/24 mm. is collected; it weighs 125\u2013150 g. (77\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 2)."

            "In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, separatory funnel, and thermometer, are placed 189 g. (2 moles) of chloroacetic acid and 150 cc. of water. The flask is cooled in ice water, and a cold solution of 160 g. (4 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water is added, with stirring, at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 30\u00b0 (Note 1). After all the alkali has been added, the cooling bath is removed and an aqueous solution (Note 2) containing 31 g. (1 mole) of methylamine is added slowly. The reaction is exothermic, and the temperature is kept below 50\u00b0 by occasional immersion of the flask in ice water. After all the methylamine has been added, the solution is allowed to stand for two hours to complete the reaction.\nA solution of 257 g. (1.05 moles) of barium chloride dihydrate in about 500 cc. of hot water is added to the reaction mixture, with vigorous shaking, and the mixture is heated on a steam bath for one-half hour. A heavy precipitate of the barium salt of the amino acid separates at once. After cooling to room temperature, the barium salt is collected on a suction filter, transferred to a beaker, and washed with two 250-cc. portions of hot water (80\u00b0). After drying at 100\u00b0, the barium salt weighs 225\u2013230 g. (80\u201382 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe dry barium salt is placed in a 2-l. flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, 600 cc. of water is added, and the mixture heated to boiling. The calculated quantity of 5 N sulfuric acid (Note 3) is introduced gradually from a separatory funnel into the well-stirred mixture over a period of about one hour. The mixture is then centrifuged or filtered with suction (Note 4) through a thin layer of fuller's earth. The barium sulfate precipitate is transferred to a beaker and extracted with two 250-cc. portions of boiling water. The filtrate and washings are transferred to a distilling flask placed in a water bath and concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 175\u2013200 cc. (Note 5). The syrupy residue is poured into a large beaker and treated with 500 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol. Crystals of the acid begin to appear at once. The mixture is allowed to stand for three or four hours in an ice bath to complete the precipitation, and the crystalline solid is separated by filtration with suction. After being washed with two 75-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, the product is dried at 100\u00b0. The methyliminodiacetic acid forms fine, white crystals, m.p. 215\u00b0, and weighs 92\u2013105 g. (63\u201371 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nIf an especially pure product is desired, the acid may be reprecipitated by dissolving in an equal weight of warm water and adding three volumes of methyl alcohol. The loss in purification is 4\u20135 per cent."

(2 moles) of pure benzyl cyanide (Note 2) and 264 g. (3 moles) of dry ethyl acetate (Note 3). The mixture is thoroughly shaken, the condenser closed with a calcium chloride tube, and the solution heated on the steam bath for two hours before standing overnight (Note 4). The next morning the mixture is stirred with a wooden rod to break lumps, cooled in a freezing mixture to \u221210\u00b0, and kept at this temperature for two hours. The sodium salt is collected on a 6-in. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed four times on the funnel with 250-cc. portions of ether. The filter cake is practically colorless and corresponds to 250\u2013275 g. of dry sodium salt, or 69\u201376 per cent of the calculated amount. The combined filtrates are placed in the freezing mixture until they can be worked up as indicated below.\nThe sodium salt still wet with ether is dissolved in 1.3 l. of distilled water at room temperature, the solution cooled to 0\u00b0, and the nitrile precipitated by adding slowly, with vigorous shaking, 90 cc. of glacial acetic acid, while the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0. The precipitate is separated by suction filtration and washed four times on the funnel with 250-cc. portions of water. The moist cake weighing about 300 g. (Note 5) corresponds to 188\u2013206 g. (59\u201364 per cent) of dry colorless \u03b1-phenylacetoacetonitrile, m.p. 87\u201389\u00b0, which is suitable for most purposes.\nIf it is desired to recrystallize the crude product, the moist cake is dissolved in 100 cc. of hot methyl alcohol and the solution filtered and cooled, with stirring, to \u221210\u00b0. The crystals are separated by suction filtration and washed once on the filter with 40 cc. of methyl alcohol cooled to \u221210\u00b0. When dry, the product weighs 173\u2013191 g.

The aqueous layer is extracted twice in a similar manner with 500-cc. portions of ether, and the ether extracts are discarded. The ether remaining in the aqueous layer is removed under diminished pressure by drawing air through the solution for one hour with a suction pump, and the \u03b1-phenylacetoacetonitrile is precipitated by adding 60 cc. of glacial acetic acid. If an oil is thrown out, the flask is placed in an ice bath until the precipitate is crystalline. The crystals are separated by suction filtration and washed four times on the funnel with 50-cc. portions of water. When dry the tan-colored product weighs 50\u201355 g. and melts at 83\u201386\u00b0. It is dissolved in the methyl alcohol mother liquors from the crystallization of the first lot. The solution is boiled with a little Norite, filtered, and cooled to \u221210\u00b0. The crystals which form are collected on a filter, washed with 10 cc. of cold methyl alcohol, and dried. There is obtained 43\u201348 g. of pale straw-colored material, m.p. 87\u201389\u00b0.

The reaction is vigorous at first, and the flask is kept cold with ice; moisture must be excluded.

Five hundred grams of potassium hydroxide pellets (85 per cent potassium hydroxide) (7.6 moles) and 750 cc. of commercial absolute methyl alcohol (free from acetone) are placed in the flask, and stirring is begun. The bulk of the alkali dissolves in a few minutes, with the evolution of heat. The flask is now surrounded by an ample cold-water bath, and, when the internal temperature drops to 60\u00b0, addition of a mixture of 360 g. (353 cc., 3 moles) of p-tolualdehyde (Note 1), 300 cc. of formalin (3.9 moles) (Note 2), and 300 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol is begun at such a rate that the internal temperature remains at 60\u201370\u00b0. This addition requires about fifteen minutes. The internal temperature is then maintained at 60\u201370\u00b0 for three hours, after which the reflux condenser is replaced by a downward condenser and the methyl alcohol distilled with the aid of a brine bath until the internal temperature reaches 101\u00b0. Nine hundred cubic centimeters of cold water is then added to the warm residue, and the mixture is cooled. The resulting two layers are separated at once (Note 3), and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 200-cc. portions of benzene. The combined oil and extracts are washed with five or six 50-cc. portions of water (Note 4), and the combined washings extracted with 50 cc. of benzene, the benzene layer being added to the washed extract. The benzene solution is cleared by shaking it with a few grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate and is then distilled under diminished pressure. After removal of the benzene, 331 g. (90 per cent of the theoretical amount) of p-tolyl carbinol (b.p. 116\u2013118\u00b0/20 mm.) is obtained; the product solidifies in the receiver to a mass of oil-drenched crystals melting at 54\u201355\u00b0. Recrystallization from an equal weight of commercial heptane (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0) gives an 80 per cent recovery of long needles which melt at 61\u00b0. A further 8 per cent is recoverable by concentration of the mother liquor (Note 5) and (Note 6)."

(0.26 mole) of o-chlorobenzoic acid (Note 1), 41 g. (0.3 mole) of technical anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 1 g. of copper oxide is refluxed for two hours, using an oil bath. The excess aniline is removed by distillation with steam (about three hours is required), and 20 g. of decolorizing carbon (Note 2) is added to the brown residual solution. The mixture is boiled for fifteen minutes and filtered by suction. The filtrate is added, with stirring, to a mixture of 30 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 60 cc. of water. The precipitated acid is filtered with suction when cold. After drying to constant weight in the air, the yield is 46\u201352 g. (82\u201393 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a nearly white product; m.p. 179\u2013181\u00b0 with preliminary shrinking (Note 3), (Note 4), and (Note 5).\n(B) Acridone.\u2014In a 500-cc. flask a solution of 42.7 g.

Spattering is minimized by allowing the solution to run down the wall of the container. The yellow precipitate is filtered after boiling for five minutes, and the filtrate is saved (Note 7). The moist solid is boiled for five minutes with a solution of 30 g. (0.28 mole) of sodium carbonate in 400 cc. of water, collected with suction (Note 8), and washed well with water. After drying in the air the crude acridone weighs 35.5\u201337.5 g. (91\u201396 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 344\u2013346\u00b0 (Note 9). This material is pure enough for many purposes; it may be recrystallized from a mixture of aniline and acetic acid, using 10 cc. of aniline and 25 cc. of acetic acid for every 2 g. of solid. The recovery is about 90 per cent, and the recrystallized product melts at 348\u2013352\u00b0 (Note 10)."

(2.5 moles) of technical sodium nitrite (95 per cent) in 500 cc. of water (Note 1). The flask is placed in an ice-salt mixture, and a cold (\u22128\u00b0) solution of sodium bisulfite, prepared by saturating with sulfur dioxide a solution of 143 g. (1.35 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 600 cc. of water, is added. While the temperature is kept below 0\u00b0, a moderate stream of sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture until it is acid to Congo red and then just enough longer to remove the dark color which appears shortly before the solution becomes acid.\nTo this solution are added 196 g. (2 moles) of technical cyclohexanone and 500 cc. of 85 per cent ethyl alcohol; the cooling bath is replaced by a steam bath, the stirrer started, and the mixture heated to 75\u00b0. The flask is then packed in mineral wool or other insulating material and allowed to cool slowly, with effective stirring, for forty-eight hours. The solution at room temperature is exactly neutralized to litmus with a 50 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide, with cooling and stirring. About 330 g. of sodium hydroxide solution is required.\nThe oily layer is separated and the aqueous solution extracted with two 200-cc. portions of ether. The oil and ether extracts are combined, the ether is removed, and the residue distilled from a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask having a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The fraction boiling at 95\u2013100\u00b0 at 5 mm. weighs 170\u2013190 g. and melts at 78\u201380\u00b0. This product is transferred to a large mortar, allowed to cool, and ground with 120 cc. of petroleum ether (b.p. 35\u201360\u00b0). After filtering with suction, and allowing the solvent to evaporate from the crystals, there is obtained 133\u2013147 g. of cyclohexanone oxime (59\u201365 per cent of the calculated amount) melting at 86\u201388\u00b0 (Note 2).",

In a 1-l. beaker are placed a 10-g. portion of the oxime and 20 cc. of 85 per cent sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.783) (Note 4). The beaker is heated with a low flame and the contents are mixed with a rotary motion until bubbles first appear. The beaker is then removed from the flame immediately, and the violent reaction, which lasts a few seconds, is allowed to subside. The acid solution of \u03b5-caprolactam is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, and another 10-g. portion of the oxime is placed in the beaker and rearranged with sulfuric acid as before. The combined acid solution from the ten operations is diluted with 2.5 l. of water and boiled gently for one and one-half hours with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon. The solution is filtered and exactly neutralized to litmus with 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. About 510 g. of sodium hydroxide solution is usually required. The neutral solution is boiled for one-half hour with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtered.\nThe filtrate is placed in a 5-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, cooled in an ice bath to 10\u00b0, and a solution of 55 g. (1.37 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 55 cc. of water added. The temperature being kept at 10\u00b0, 94 g. (0.67 mole) of benzoyl chloride is added dropwise from a separatory funnel over a period of thirty-five to forty minutes, with rapid stirring. The mixture is stirred for an hour longer, filtered, and placed in a 4-l. beaker. The cold filtrate is slowly acidified to Congo red by adding 10 per cent hydrochloric acid, with hand stirring (about 450 cc. of acid is required). The solid (Note 5) is filtered with suction, washed with water, and spread out to dry. When dry, the product is washed with two 100-cc. portions of petroleum ether (35\u201360\u00b0) to remove the admixed benzoic acid. The adhering petroleum ether is allowed to evaporate from the crystals, and the final drying is carried out in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid. The yield of purified product, m.p. 77\u201380\u00b0, is 135\u2013150 g. (65\u201372 per cent of the calculated amount, based on cyclohexanone oxime)."

The condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap, and 217 g. (131 cc., 1.6 moles) of sulfuryl chloride (Note 1) is added over a period of thirty minutes, with rapid stirring and cooling with tap water. The dropping funnel is then replaced by a thermometer dipping into the liquid, and the flask is heated slowly, with stirring, until the refluxing of the butyl chloride becomes vigorous (about 100\u2013110\u00b0). Sulfur dioxide is evolved copiously during this time. The condenser is replaced with a 40-cm. Vigreux column and downward condenser; the temperature is gradually raised to 130\u2013135\u00b0 and kept there until no more sulfur dioxide or butyl chloride distils. The heating and distillation require about two hours. The residue of crude n-butyl sulfate is cooled to room temperature, and 100 cc. of saturated sodium carbonate solution is added. The mixture is stirred for about ten minutes, poured into a separatory funnel, and let stand for thirty minutes to allow the layers to separate. The upper layer is dried with calcium chloride, at least overnight, and then allowed to stand over 15 g. of anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate for a day, with occasional shaking. The product is filtered into a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and distilled from an oil bath. The first distillation gives 250\u2013280 g. (74\u201383 per cent of the calculated amount) of n-butyl sulfate, b.p. 110\u2013114\u00b0/4 mm., which has a sharp odor.

The temperature of the bath is increased slowly and distillation is continued, with a water pump, until the bath reaches a temperature of about 125\u00b0. The bath is again cooled to 75\u201380\u00b0 and the distillation is continued at lower pressure, using an oil pump.\nThe first fractions consist of a little alcohol, water, and n-butyl ether (Note 5). The next fraction is ethyl sebacate, b.p. 156\u2013158\u00b0 at 6 mm. (Note 6). Ethyl hydrogen sebacate is collected at 183\u2013187\u00b0 at 6 mm. The product melts at 34\u201336\u00b0 and weighs 114\u2013124 g. (50\u201354 per cent of the calculated amount, based on the sebacic acid used). Refractionation of the fore-run (b.p. 175\u2013183\u00b0/6 mm.) and after-run (b.p. 187\u2013195\u00b0/6 mm.) gives an additional 24\u201326 g. of pure monoester. The total yield is 138\u2013150 g. (60\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

            "In a steel reaction vessel (Note 1), capable of withstanding high pressures with an adequate safety factor (Note 2) and having a capacity of 400 cc. or more, are placed 252 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl adipate (b.p. 144\u2013145\u00b0/29 mm.) (p. 264) and 20 g. of copper chromite catalyst, prepared either with or without the addition of barium (p. 142). The reaction vessel is closed, made gas tight, and secured in a suitable agitating device. After connection is made with the hydrogen supply, hydrogen is introduced until a pressure of 2000 to 3000 lb. per sq. in. is reached (Note 2).\nAgitation is started, and the reaction system is heated as rapidly as possible to 255\u00b0. The temperature is maintained at 255\u00b0 (Note 3), and hydrogenation is continued until hydrogen absorption is complete (Note 4). The agitation is now stopped, the vessel cooled, and the pressure released. With the aid of four 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent alcohol the reaction mixture is transferred to a 600-cc. beaker. The catalyst is removed by filtering or centrifuging, and is washed with four more 25-cc. portions of alcohol (Note 5). To the reaction product (Note 6), 50 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added, and the alcoholic solution is boiled for two hours under a reflux condenser. The mixture is transferred to a 1-l. distilling flask and the alcohol removed by distilling to a vapor temperature of 95\u00b0. The hot residue is transferred to an apparatus for the continuous extraction of liquids (p. 615), using 50 cc. of water to rinse the flask, and the solution is exhaustively extracted with ether (Note 7). The ether is distilled, and, after the removal of water and alcohol, the glycol is distilled under reduced pressure in a 250-cc. Claisen flask. The yield is 125\u2013132 g. (85\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount). Hexamethylene glycol boils at 143\u2013144\u00b0 (bath at 160\u00b0) under 4 mm. pressure and melts at 41\u201342\u00b0."

            "In a 3-l. beaker, 110 g. (0.8 mole) of anthranilic acid (Note 1) is dissolved in 1 l. of water and 80 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19); the solution is cooled to 20\u00b0. In a 2-l. beaker a solution of iodine monochloride in hydrochloric acid is prepared by diluting 140 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid with 500 cc. of cold water, adding just sufficient crushed ice to bring the temperature to 5\u00b0, and, during about two minutes, stirring in 131 g. (0.8 mole) of iodine monochloride (p. 197).\nThe iodine monochloride solution at 5\u00b0 is stirred rapidly into the anthranilic acid solution at 20\u00b0. 5-Iodoanthranilic acid separates almost immediately as a granular, tan to violet precipitate, and the reaction temperature rises to 18\u201322\u00b0. The mixture is stirred for an hour, while warming to room temperature, then filtered on a 13-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The acid is pressed as dry as possible, washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold water, and then dried at 90\u2013100\u00b0. There is obtained 185\u2013189 g. (88\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount) of brown to purple acid which melts at 185\u2013190\u00b0, with decomposition (Note 2).\n5-Iodoanthranilic acid is best purified by recrystallization of its ammonium salt, as follows: To 100 g. of the acid in a 400-cc. beaker is added 200 cc. of hot water, and the acid is dissolved by stirring in concentrated ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) until solution is complete at 60\u00b0 and there is a slight excess of ammonia. About 40 cc. of concentrated ammonia is required. Sodium hydrosulfite is added in about 1-g. portions until no further bleaching action is observed, about 5 g. of decolorizing charcoal is added, and, after stirring three minutes, the mixture is filtered with suction on a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel into a preheated flask. The filter is washed with 10 cc. of boiling water.\nThe combined filtrate and washings are transferred to a 400-cc. beaker, allowed to cool slowly without agitation until crystal formation appears complete, then cooled to 5\u00b0. The crystalline ammonium salt is then removed by suction filtration on a large B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 15 cc. of ice water, sucked as dry as possible, and spread in a thin layer on an enameled or glass tray and allowed to dry in air at 35\u201350\u00b0. The yield of yellow to violet ammonium salt is 80\u201389 g., representing a recovery of 76\u201384 per cent (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nThe ammonium salt is dissolved in three parts of hot water, ammonia is added if necessary to effect complete solution at 60\u00b0, the solution is again treated with sodium hydrosulfite and 3\u20134 g. of decolorizing charcoal, filtered hot, and the 5-iodoanthranilic acid is precipitated by adding c.p. hydrochloric acid in 3- to 5-cc. portions, stirring thoroughly after each addition, until the reaction mixture is just faintly acid to Congo red. Ice is then added until the temperature is reduced to 20\u00b0, and the precipitated acid is removed by suction filtration, washed freely with cold water, and dried at 100\u2013110\u00b0 (Note 5). 5-Iodoanthranilic acid is almost quantitatively precipitated from its ammonium salt solution and is obtained as a yellow powder, m.p. 190\u2013195\u00b0 (decomp.)

(196 cc., 2.15 moles) of aniline, and 2 kg. of ice (Note 1). The mixture is agitated by a mechanical stirrer, and, as soon as the temperature drops below 5\u00b0, a chilled solution of 156 g. (2.26 moles) of sodium nitrite in a measured volume (700\u20131000 cc.) of water is introduced fairly rapidly from a separatory funnel, the stem of which projects below the surface of the reaction mixture. The addition should not be fast enough to cause the temperature to rise to 10\u00b0 or to cause evolution of oxides of nitrogen. The last 5 per cent of the nitrite solution is added more slowly, and the reaction mixture is tested with starch-iodide paper at intervals until an excess of nitrous acid is indicated.\nStirring is continued for ten minutes, and if necessary the solution is filtered rapidly through a loose cotton plug in a large funnel. An aqueous solution of 358 g. (2.16 moles) of potassium iodide is added and the reaction mixture allowed to stand overnight. The mixture is transferred to a large flask (or two smaller flasks) and heated on a steam bath, using an air-cooled reflux condenser, until no more gas is evolved, then allowed to cool and stand undisturbed until the heavy organic layer has settled thoroughly. A large part of the upper aqueous layer is siphoned off, and discarded (Note 2). The residual aqueous and organic layers are made alkaline by the cautious addition of strong sodium hydroxide solution (100\u2013125 g. of solid technical sodium hydroxide is usually required) and steam-distilled at once. The last one-third of the steam distillate is collected separately and combined with the aqueous layer separated from the earlier portions of the distillate. This mixture is acidified with 5\u201310 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid and steam-distilled again. The iodobenzene from this operation is combined with the main portion and dried with 10\u201315 g. of calcium chloride (Note 3) and (Note 4). Distillation under reduced pressure gives 327\u2013335 g.

(0.5 mole) of sodium nitrite are dissolved in a mixture of 500 cc. of warm water and 60 cc. of 30 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. After cooling to 20\u00b0 the solution is added from a dropping funnel, over a period of fifteen to twenty minutes, to a well-stirred mixture of 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) and 250 g. of ice in a 2-l. beaker; more ice is added, as required, to keep the temperature below 20\u00b0. The insoluble, yellow diazonium compound separates before completion of the diazotization. After all the solution has been added from the dropping funnel, the reaction mixture is stirred for five minutes and tested for excess nitrous acid with starch-iodide paper. If required, small amounts of solid sodium nitrite are added and the test is repeated at three-minute intervals until a slight excess is definitely established. The diazonium compound is allowed to settle and as much as possible of the supernatant liquor is decanted, leaving a slurry of diazonium compound.\nIn a 3-l. beaker are placed 750 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 1.5 g. of finely ground copper sulfate, and the mixture is heated on a hot plate or steam bath to 70\u00b0. The diazonium slurry is added in about 30-cc. portions to the well-stirred alcohol; the temperature is kept between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, and the nitrogen evolution is allowed to subside considerably between additions. The final traces of diazonium slurry are washed into the alcohol with small amounts of the decanted solution, the remainder of which is then added to the alcohol in 100-cc. portions. The reaction mixture is heated and stirred at 65\u201370\u00b0 for half an hour, and then cooled without agitation to 5\u00b0. The m-iodobenzoic acid which separates is filtered with suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with three 50-cc. portions of cold water, and dried at 90\u2013110\u00b0. There is obtained 107\u2013116 g. of crude, brown m-iodobenzoic acid (86\u201393 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 1).\nThe crude m-iodobenzoic acid is purified by recrystallization of its ammonium salt. To 100 g. of the acid in a 250-cc. beaker is added 75 cc. of hot water, and the acid is partially neutralized with 24 cc. of concentrated ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9). After stirring at 80\u00b0 until no more acid dissolves, neutralization is completed by adding 2\u20135 cc. of ammonia, until the acid is completely dissolved. The solution is heated to 90\u00b0, 1 g. of decolorizing charcoal is added, and the mixture is filtered with suction using a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel and filter flask. The residue on the filter is washed with 15 cc. of boiling water. The combined washings and filtrate are transferred to a 250-cc. beaker and allowed to cool without agitation to 25\u201335\u00b0, then cooled by any convenient means to 5\u00b0. The ammonium m-iodobenzoate crystals are filtered and pressed as dry as possible on a B\u00fcchner funnel, spread in a thin layer on a glass or enameled tray, and dried at a temperature not above 60\u00b0. There is obtained 86\u201390 g. of faintly yellow to tan prisms of the ammonium salt, a recovery of 80\u201384 per cent (Note 2).\nThe ammonium salt thus obtained is recrystallized until white by dissolving it in an equal weight of water at 80\u00b0 and cooling to 5\u00b0. The recovery in this purification averages 75\u201385 per cent (Note 3).\nm-Iodobenzoic acid melting at 187\u2013188\u00b0 is obtained by dissolving pure ammonium m-iodobenzoate in four times its weight of hot water, precipitating the acid by acidifying the solution to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid, adding ice to reduce the temperature to 20\u00b0, filtering by suction, washing the acid freely with cold water, and drying at 90\u2013110\u00b0 (Note 4)."

            "In a 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel (Note 1) are placed 25 g. (0.1 mole) of the azlactone of \u03b1-benzoylaminocinnamic acid (Note 2) and (Note 3), 20 g. (0.64 gram atom) of red phosphorus, and 135 g. (125 cc.) of acetic anhydride. During a period of about one hour 195 g. (125 cc., 0.76 mole) of 50 per cent hydriodic acid (sp. gr. 1.56) is added with stirring (Note 4). The mixture is refluxed for three to four hours and, after cooling, is filtered with suction. The unreacted phosphorus is washed on the filter with two 5-cc. portions of glacial acetic acid, and discarded. The filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness, under reduced pressure, in a 500-cc. Claisen flask heated in a water bath. A 250-cc. distilling flask cooled in ice is used as a receiver, and the distillate is reserved for a second reduction (Note 5).\nTo the dry residue in the Claisen flask 100 cc. of water is added, and the evaporation to dryness is repeated. The second distillate is discarded. To the residue in the flask 150 cc. of water and 150 cc. of ether are added, and the mixture is shaken until solution is complete. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted three times with 100-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are discarded; the water solution is heated on a steam bath with 2\u20133 g. of Norite and a trace of sodium sulfite until all dissolved ether has been removed. The solution is filtered, and the filtrate is heated to boiling and neutralized to Congo red with 15 per cent ammonia (sp. gr. 0.94). Usually about 25 cc. of ammonia is required. The phenylalanine separates in colorless plates which, when cold, are filtered and washed thoroughly on the filter with two 30-cc. portions of cold water. The yield is 10.5\u201311 g. (63.6\u201367 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which decomposes at 284\u2013288\u00b0(corr.) (Note 6).",
            "A solution of 20.5 g. (0.1 mole) of \u03b1-acetaminocinnamic acid (p. 1) in 150 cc. of glacial acetic acid (Note 1) is placed in the bottle of a Burgess-Parr reduction apparatus, 0.5 g. of platinum oxide catalyst (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 463) is added, and the mixture is shaken in an atmosphere of hydrogen under an initial pressure of 40 lb. per sq. in. until the calculated amount of gas is taken up; usually about two hours is required (Note 2) and (Note 3). When the reduction is complete, the catalyst is removed by suction filtration and washed with a little water. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under diminished pressure on a water bath.\nThe crystalline residue (Note 4) is taken up in 400 cc. of 1 N hydrochloric acid, transferred to a 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and boiled for ten hours (Note 5). The resulting solution is evaporated to dryness under diminished pressure on the water bath; to the residue 100 cc. of water is added slowly through a dropping funnel at about the same rate as that at which it distils, in order to remove the excess hydrochloric acid as completely as possible. The residue is then taken up in 30\u201340 cc. of boiling water, and the pH of the solution is adjusted until it is basic to Congo red, but still acid to litmus, by careful addition of concentrated ammonia and acetic acid (Note 6). Then two volumes of 95 per cent alcohol is added to aid in the separation of the phenylalanine. The mixture is placed in the refrigerator for a day, after which the product is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel, and washed first with three 25-cc. portions of ice-cold water and then with alcohol. The yield is 14.5 g. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on the water bath, and the residue is extracted with about 70 cc. of ice-cold water in three or four portions. The insoluble material, after washing with 95 per cent alcohol, is added to the main fraction of phenylalanine. The total yield is 16 g. (Note 7).\nThe combined fractions weighing about 16 g. are dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling water (Note 8), two volumes of 95 per cent alcohol is added, and the flask is placed in a refrigerator overnight to complete crystallization. The phenylalanine is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with several small portions of ice-cold water, and finally with alcohol. The yield is 10.5\u201311 g. By concentrating the filtrate and washings further, 3\u20133.5 g. of product can be obtained conveniently. The total yield is 14\u201314.3 g. (85\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount) of analytically pure phenylalanine."

            "In a 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser, are placed 69 g. (0.5 mole) of o-nitroaniline (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 388), 40 cc. of a 20 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide, and 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethanol. The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated on a steam bath until the solution boils gently. The steam is turned off, and 10-g. portions of 130 g. (2 gram atoms) of zinc dust (Note 1) are added frequently enough to keep the solution boiling (Note 2) and (Note 3). After the addition of zinc dust has been completed the mixture is refluxed with continued stirring for one hour; the color of the solution changes from a deep red to nearly colorless. The hot mixture is filtered by suction, and the zinc residue is returned to the flask and extracted with two 150-cc. portions of hot alcohol. To the combined filtrates is added 2\u20133 g. of sodium hydrosulfite, and the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (using a water pump), on a steam bath, to a volume of 125\u2013150 cc. After cooling thoroughly in an ice-salt bath, the faintly yellow crystals are collected, washed once with a small amount of ice water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of crude o-phenylenediamine melting at 97\u2013100\u00b0 is 46\u201350 g. (85\u201393 per cent of the theoretical amount).

            "(A) Sodium Phenyl-aci-nitroacetonitrile.\u2014In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser is placed 400 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol. Through the condenser tube 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of freshly cut metallic sodium is added as rapidly as possible, and the flask is heated in an oil bath after all the sodium has been added. After about one-half hour only a small globule of molten sodium (0.5\u20131.0 g.) remains and sodium ethoxide begins to precipitate. At this point 100 cc. of absolute alcohol is added and the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0. A second 100-cc. portion of cold absolute alcohol is then poured on top of the solid cake of sodium ethoxide in the flask (Note 1). The reflux condenser is replaced by a stopper carrying a separatory funnel and a calcium chloride tube. An ice-cold mixture of 234 g. (2 moles) of freshly distilled benzyl cyanide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 107) and 216 g. (180 cc., 2.8 moles) of methyl nitrate (Note 2) is added with constant shaking, at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 4\u00b0 and 8\u00b0. After this addition is completed (about one hour is required), the reaction mixture is allowed to remain at 4\u20138\u00b0 and shaken intermittently for one hour. The flask is then provided with a stopper fitted with a Bunsen valve and placed in a freezing mixture for twenty-four hours. The sodium salt of the aci-nitro compound which precipitates is filtered with suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed thoroughly with dry ether (Note 3), and air dried. The first crop of material weighs 215\u2013275 g. (58\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount). The mother liquor and ether washings are combined and concentrated stepwise to about 150 cc. under reduced pressure. Successive crops of the sodium salt which separate are filtered with suction and washed with dry ether. The total weight of the crude sodium salt is 275\u2013300 g. (75\u201382 per cent yield). This material is used directly without purification.\n(B) Phenylnitromethane.\u2014In a 4-l. beaker 300 g. of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water. The beaker is placed in an enameled pan (as a precaution against breakage), and the solution is heated to boiling. Over a period of one hour the air-dried, crude sodium salt of phenylnitroacetonitrile (275\u2013300 g.) is added in small portions to the boiling alkali. Boiling is continued until the evolution of ammonia ceases (about three hours); hot water is added from time to time to keep the volume of the solution fairly constant (Note 4). The hot alkaline solution is poured into a shallow porcelain dish and on cooling solidifies to a waxy mass.\nThe cake of crude sodium salt of phenylnitroacetic acid is broken up with a spoon, transferred to a 4-l. beaker, and stirred with 500 g. of ice. The beaker is placed in a large crock packed with ice-salt mixture, and is provided with a mechanical stirrer. When the solution in the beaker has cooled to \u22125\u00b0, concentrated hydrochloric acid is added slowly from a separatory funnel, with vigorous stirring, until the solution is faintly acid to Congo red. During the addition of acid the temperature is not allowed to rise above \u22125\u00b0 (Note 5). Usually about 900 cc. of acid is needed and the addition requires about two hours. The cold solution is extracted with one 500-cc. portion of ether, followed by two 250-cc. portions. The combined ether extracts are washed with ice-cold portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution until the wash liquid is colorless or only faintly yellow (usually two 100-cc. portions suffice). The ether solution is then washed with 250 cc. of ice water containing two drops of hydrochloric acid, and finally with three 50-cc. portions of ice water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and allowed to stand for three or four days to complete the isomerization of the labile aci-form. The solution is filtered and the ether removed at 15\u201320\u00b0 under reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled at 3 mm. pressure in an ordinary Claisen flask, and the phenylnitromethane is obtained as a light yellow oil, b.p. 90\u201392\u00b0/3 mm. (Note 6). The yield is 135\u2013150 g. (50\u201355 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the benzyl cyanide) (Note 7)."

An additional 10\u201315 g. of less pure product is obtained by making the filtrate alkaline to litmus; this requires about 1250 cc. of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide. The two fractions are combined, dissolved in about 1.2 l. of boiling ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0), and filtered rapidly through a large fluted filter in a heated funnel. The product separates from the filtrate in the form of long yellow needles, and crystallization is completed by thorough chilling. The melting point of the purified product is 73\u201374\u00b0, and the total yield is 56\u201360 g. (63\u201367 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4)."

The solution is cooled to 5\u00b0 in an ice-salt mixture, and to it is added with stirring a mixture of 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 12 g. (0.17 mole) of sodium nitrite, also cooled to 5\u00b0 (Note 1). To liberate nitrous acid from the nitrosylsulfuric acid, there is then added slowly from a separatory funnel, with rapid stirring, 200 cc. of 85 per cent phosphoric acid (151 cc. of u.s.p. phosphoric acid diluted to 200 cc.). During the addition the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0. The mixture is removed from the ice-salt bath and stirred until diazotization is complete (one to two hours) (Note 2). At the end of this time the solution is poured, with stirring, into 2 l. of a mixture of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. To destroy excess nitrous acid about 15 g. of urea is added in small portions, with stirring, as long as gas is produced. The mixture is filtered if it is not clear and is then treated gradually with a solution of 30 g. (0.18 mole) of potassium iodide in 200 cc. of water. To complete the reaction the mixture is heated until no more gas is evolved. Any free iodine is removed by sodium bisulfite, and the mixture is then filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed free from sulfuric acid and inorganic salts, pressed, and sucked as dry as possible. The product is then air dried to constant weight. The yield of light brown, crude material, m.p. 160\u2013162\u00b0, is 60\u201361 g. (94\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount).

            "A solution of 63 g. (0.226 mole) of pure triphenylchloromethane (Note 1) in 1.5 l. of pure anhydrous ether is prepared in a 2-l. bottle provided with a tight ground-glass stopper, and 1150 g. of freshly prepared 1 per cent sodium amalgam (0.5 gram atom of sodium) is added (Note 2). The stopper is greased with a small amount of Lubriseal and the bottle is stoppered tightly. The bottle is clamped firmly in a mechanical shaker and shaken vigorously. The reaction is strongly exothermic, and the bottle should be cooled with wet towels during the shaking operation. A persistent blood-red color develops rapidly, generally within ten minutes. After shaking for three hours the bottle is cooled to room temperature, removed from the shaker, and allowed to stand undisturbed until the sodium chloride has settled (Note 3).\nThe ether solution of triphenylmethylsodium is separated from the sodium chloride and amalgan by the following procedure. The stopper of the reaction bottle is removed and replaced immediately by a closely fitting two-holed cork carrying a short glass tube that protrudes about 1 cm. into the bottle, and a long glass tube bent into an inverted U-shape. The short tube is connected through a drying train to a cylinder of nitrogen. One arm of the U-tube reaches to within about 4 cm. of the bottom of the bottle, and the other end extends just below the bottom of a two-holed cork that is fitted tightly into a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is filled with nitrogen and serves as receiver for the decanted solution. The cork of the Erlenmeyer flask is provided with a short-stemmed separatory funnel which serves to release nitrogen during the decantation and may be used subsequently to introduce reactants (Note 4). The corks are sealed by a coating of paraffin-wax. The stopcock of the dropping funnel is opened slightly, and the ether solution of triphenylmethylsodium is forced slowly and steadily into the nitrogen-filled flask by means of a small pressure of nitrogen from the cylinder. With proper adjustment of the height of the glass tube above the surface of the sodium chloride and amalgam, it is possible to remove all but 50 to 75 cc. of the ether solution.\nIf a good grade of triphenylchloromethane and freshly prepared amalgam are used the yield of triphenylmethylsodium is almost quantitative. The solution may be analyzed approximately, as follows: A 50-cc. aliquot portion is allowed to flow into 25 cc. of water in a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is drawn off and the ether solution washed with three 25-cc. portions of water. The aqueous solutions are combined, boiled to expel ether, and titrated with 0.2 N sulfuric acid, methyl red being used as indicator."

            "In a 3-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask (Note 1), 100 g. (0.65 mole) of pure acenaphthene (Note 2) and 72 g. (0.72 mole) of succinic anhydride are dissolved by warming in 600 ml. of nitrobenzene. The flask is clamped in a large ice bath. Through the central opening is inserted a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer. A second opening is connected to a gas trap and also carries a thermometer; the third is for the introduction of aluminum chloride. After the mixture has been cooled to about 0\u00b0, 195 g. (1.46 moles) of aluminum chloride is added in small portions in the course of 1 hour, the temperature being kept below 5\u00b0. Stirring is continued at 0\u00b0 for 4 more hours, after which time the mixture is allowed to stand for at least 12 hours so that the ice melts and the clear red solution gradually comes to room temperature.\nThe flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam (Note 3).\nFig. 1.\nThe bulk of the nitrobenzene comes over in about 1.5 hours, and the product then separates as a pasty mass which slowly disintegrates to a powder. During this process the elimination of nitrobenzene is very slow, but the steaming should be continued until only a few small lumps remain (4\u20135 hours), although it is not necessary to remove every trace of solvent (Note 4). The mixture is cooled with tap water, the crude acid is filtered and returned to the flask, and 115 g. of sodium carbonate decahydrate is added, together with sufficient water to make the flask a little less than half full. The mixture is heated with shaking over a free flame until most of the solid has dissolved and the frothing has diminished. A few drops of capryl alcohol may be added to dissipate the froth. The dark brown solution is steam-distilled to eliminate the last traces of nitrobenzene (about 30 minutes) and then filtered by suction from a very light residue. One hundred grams of sodium chloride is dissolved in the hot solution (volume, about 1.5 l.), which is then allowed to cool without disturbance. The sodium salt of \u03b2-(3-acenaphthoyl) propionic acid separates as colorless, fibrous needles, while the isomeric 1-acid largely remains in solution (Note 5). The product is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel and washed free of the dark mother liquor with half-saturated sodium chloride solution (about 150 ml.), the combined filtrates (A) being set aside. The sodium salt is crystallized once more from boiling water (1\u20131.5 l.) (Note 6), using Norit if required, and adding 50 g. of sodium chloride to the hot filtered solution. The mother liquor (B) is again saved. The purified salt is dissolved in 1.2 l. of hot water and the solution is acidified. The free acid separates as a white powder in a very pure condition. The yield of \u03b2-(3-acenaphthoyl) propionic acid melting at 206\u2013208\u00b0 with decomposition is 133 g. (81%) (Note 7)."

            "One hundred and sixteen grams (2 moles) of acetone (Note 1) and 510 g. (5 moles) of reagent grade acetic anhydride are placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask and cooled in an ice-salt bath. One neck of the flask is stoppered; the second neck contains a tube for admitting boron trifluoride; and the third neck contains an outlet tube leading to an alkali trap to catch any unabsorbed boron trifluoride. Commercial grade boron trifluoride (Note 2) is passed through a Kjeldahl bulb, to prevent the reaction mixture from sucking back into the cylinder, and is then bubbled into the reaction mixture at such a rate that 500 g. is absorbed in about 5 hours (2 bubbles per second). The reaction mixture is poured into a solution of 800 g. of hydrated sodium acetate in 1.6 l. of water contained in a 5-l. flask. The mixture is then steam-distilled and the distillate collected in the following portions: 1 l., 500 ml., 500 ml., 400 ml.\nA solution of reagent grade hydrated copper acetate is made by dissolving 240 g. of the salt in 3 l. of water at about 85\u00b0 and filtering from any basic acetate. The copper salt of acetylacetone is then precipitated by adding 1.4 l. of the hot copper acetate solution to the first fraction of the acetylacetone, 700 ml. to the second, 500 ml. to the third, and 400 ml. to the fourth fraction. After standing for 3 hours, or better overnight, in a refrigerator the salt is filtered, washed once with water, and sucked dry. The salt is shaken in a separatory funnel with 800 ml. of 20% sulfuric acid and 800 ml. of ether, and the ether layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with 400 ml. and then 200 ml. of ether. The combined extracts are dried with 250 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation. The residue is distilled through a Widmer column (Note 3) and yields 160\u2013170 g. of acetylacetone boiling at 134\u2013136\u00b0 (80\u201385% based on acetone).",
            "Sixty-nine grams (3 gram atoms) of sodium, from which all the oxide coating has been cut away, and 400 ml. of dry xylene (Note 1) are placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask and heated until the sodium is melted. The flask is closed with a rubber stopper (Note 2), and the sodium is finely powdered by vigorous shaking. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 3-l. three-necked flask, and the xylene decanted. The sodium is washed with two 100-ml. portions of anhydrous ether (Note 3) by decantation. One liter of anhydrous ether is added, and the flask is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a condenser, Hershberg stirrer (Org. Syntheses, 17, 31), and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. The condenser and dropping funnel are protected by drying tubes containing absorbent cotton (Note 4). One hundred and thirty-eight grams (175 ml., 3 moles) of anhydrous ethanol is placed in the dropping funnel, and the stirrer is started. The alcohol is dropped in over a period of 2\u20133 hours with gentle refluxing. The reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for 6 hours (Note 5) after the addition of the alcohol. The stirrer is stopped, the condenser turned downward, and the ether distilled as completely as possible from the steam bath (Note 6).\nThe condenser is again arranged for refluxing, and 1.2 l. of ethyl acetate(Note 7) is added to the warm sodium ethoxide through the separatory funnel as rapidly as possible. The stirrer is started immediately, and 174 g. (220 ml., 3 moles) of acetone (Note 1, p. 17) is dropped in over a period of 15\u201320 minutes, refluxing being maintained by heating if necessary. Addition of the acetone must be started as soon as the ethyl acetate has been added. During the addition the solution becomes quite red, and then the mixture turns brown (Note 8). The mixture is refluxed for 1 hour; the stirrer is then stopped and the contents of the flask are allowed to stand at room temperature for 12 hours, during which time crystals of the sodium salt separate.\nThe liquid layer is decanted into a 5-l. flask, and the sodium salt of the diketone is dissolved and washed into the flask with 2.5 l. of ice water. After the salt is dissolved, the ester layer is separated as soon as possible (Note 9). The water layer is extracted twice with 300-ml. portions of ether, and the ether extract is discarded. To the water solution is added ice-cold dilute sulfuric acid (150 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 400 g. of cracked ice) until the solution is just acid to litmus. The diketone is extracted from the solution with four 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried for 24 hours over 60 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate in the icebox. The ether solution is decanted into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and the sodium sulfate is extracted with 100 ml. of anhydrous ether. This extract is added to the ether solution, and the ether is distilled by means of a steam bath. The residue is transferred to a 500-ml. flask, rinsing with a little ether, and distilled through a Widmer column, the portion boiling between 130\u00b0 and 139\u00b0 being collected. This fraction is dried over 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for 1 hour and, after the carbonate has been removed, is redistilled through the Widmer column. The portion boiling at 134\u2013136\u00b0 is collected; it amounts to 115\u2013136 g. (38\u201345% based on acetone)."

(21 ml., 0.23 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride, 20 ml. of o-dichlorobenzene, and 22.5 g. (0.13 mole) of anthracene (Note 1). The flask is heated on the steam bath, with stirring, to 90\u201395\u00b0 over a period of 20 minutes; the anthracene dissolves during this time to give a deep red solution, and hydrogen chloride is evolved (Note 2). The heating is continued for 1 hour (Note 3), after which a solution of 140 g. of crystalline sodium acetate in 250 ml. of water (Note 4) is added to the cooled mixture, and the o-dichlorobenzene and most of the methylaniline are rapidly distilled with steam (15\u201320 minutes). The residual reddish oil solidifies on cooling. The solid residue is broken up, and, after the aqueous liquor has been decanted through a B\u00fcchner funnel, it is washed by decantation with two 100-ml. portions of 6 N hydrochloric acid to remove amine, and then thoroughly with water (1\u20131.2 l.).

A chilled (\u221212\u00b0) solution of 16 g. (0.7 gram atom) of sodium in 250 ml. of anhydrous methanol is added with continual shaking and chilling to the chloroform solution of the nitrile. The mixture soon solidifies to a pale yellow gelatinous mass. After 10 minutes at \u221212\u00b0 this is broken up with a heavy glass rod and dissolved in 600 ml. of a suspension of ice in water. The resulting solution is acidified with an ice-cold mixture of 33 g. (18 ml., 0.32 mole) of 95% sulfuric acid, 5 ml. of acetic acid, and 45 g. of ice. The aqueous layer is separated, washed once with 50 ml. of chloroform, and evaporated without delay (Note 1) under reduced pressure. The residual heavy syrup is dissolved in 300 ml. of water and again evaporated as completely as possible under reduced pressure, in order to remove residual hydrogen cyanide (Note 2). The highly viscous residue, which contains some crystals of sodium sulfate, is dissolved in 500 ml. of hot methanol. After about 10 minutes the sodium sulfate is filtered with suction and washed with two 25-ml. portions of methanol. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at 40\u00b0 to a heavy syrup which is poured while warm into a 200-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The distilling flask is rinsed twice with 20-ml. portions of hot ethanol, and this rinse is added to the filtrate. The resulting ethanol solution soon begins to deposit crystals of arabinose; it is stirred by hand during the crystallization and gradually diluted with more ethanol until 100 ml. in all has been added during the course of an hour. The mixture is allowed to stand for 4\u20135 hours; the crystals are then filtered, washed with two 25-ml. portions of ethanol, and dried at 40\u00b0.

The \u03b2-naphthol dissolves during this period, and heat is evolved; the mixture is cooled somewhat towards the end of the addition to avoid excessive loss of hydrogen bromide. One hundred milliliters of water is then added, and the mixture is heated to boiling.

(1 mole) of fumaryl chloride (p. 422), and a reflux condenser (Note 4). A trap for absorbing hydrogen chloride is attached to the condenser.\nThe mixture is well stirred and heated externally by hot water (50\u201360\u00b0) (Note 5), the water removed, and the fumaryl chloride admitted at a brisk rate, moderated only enough to avoid a too rapid evolution of hydrogen chloride; this requires 15\u201325 minutes (Note 6) and (Note 7). The mixture turns dark red and soon reaches the boiling point; hydrogen chloride is rapidly given off. The mixture is then refluxed gently for 10 minutes with stirring.\nThe pasty red mixture is then poured portionwise upon 4 kg. of cracked ice to which has been added 75 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, the reaction mixture being thoroughly stirred before each pouring so that the aluminum chloride complex does not settle out and become concentrated at the bottom of the flask. The residue in the flask is decomposed by adding some of the ice and water. After standing 20\u201330 minutes, very hot water (Note 8) is added to melt any ice or frozen benzene and raise the temperature generally. The bulk of the aqueous layer is discarded by drawing it off with a glass tube connected to a suction flask. The benzene layer is next washed at least four times with hot water (Note 8) and (Note 9). Finally the warm benzene layer is transferred to a large separatory funnel, any crusts of dibenzoylethylene adhering to the various pieces of apparatus are dissolved in hot benzene, and the solutions combined; the small water layer is separated and discarded (Note 10). The hot benzene layer is then filtered, either by gravity using a large glass funnel or by suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel, into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. After a few porcelain chips have been added, the bulk of the solvent is distilled, using a steam or boiling water bath. Most of the residual solvent is removed under diminished pressure, using a water pump, and heating until the syrupy liquid begins to crystallize suddenly (Note 11). At this point, the heating and suction are discontinued and 125 ml. of 95% ethanol is added rapidly, stirring with a wooden paddle to break up any lumps. The flask is cooled a few minutes under the tap, and the bright yellow product is collected on a 127-mm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid is triturated on the funnel with cold ethanol for 10 minutes to remove adhering mother liquor, and sucked as dry as possible. The yield is 186\u2013197 g.

This receiver is connected to a water pump through a suction flask carrying a two-holed rubber stopper, one hole of which is left open.

The additions are made as rapidly as evolution of the ethanol permits. During the ethoxide addition a gentle stream of air is kept passing through the flask by means of a water pump attached to the receiver in order to prevent the ethanol vapor from rising in the third arm of the flask and interfering with the addition (Note 4).\nAfter all the ethoxide has been added (20\u201330 minutes) the gelatinous reaction mixture is stirred until no more distillate comes over (15\u201330 minutes). The weight of this distillate amounts to 38\u201345 g. (Note 5).\nThe oil bath is removed, and, with the stirring maintained, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature by running cold water over the flask. Then 150 ml. of water is added to dissolve the reaction mass, and both layers of the mixture are transferred to a separatory funnel. An ice-cold solution of 25 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is shaken vigorously. The ester layer is separated and washed with 200 ml. of water; it is then shaken with successive 200-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases, after which it is washed with 200 ml. of water. The bicarbonate solution is separated and extracted with 100 ml. of ether (Note 6). The ether extract, after washing with 50 ml. of water, is combined with the ester layer and the resulting ethereal solution dried with 40 g. of calcium chloride. The ether is removed by distillation from a water bath, and the excess ethyl benzoate is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The recovered ester, b.p. 80\u201383\u00b0/8 mm., amounts to 475\u2013490 g. After the ester is removed the temperature of the oil bath is slowly raised to 180\u2013185\u00b0 while the system is maintained under 8 mm. pressure. A small amount of liquid distilling higher than the ester is thus removed. When no more distillate comes over at this temperature, the remaining oil, while still warm, is poured into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and allowed to crystallize. This crude dibenzoylmethane weighs 92\u2013108 g. and is usually brown. It is recrystallized by dissolving in 150 ml. of hot methanol, adding 1 g. of Norit, filtering, and cooling the filtrate to 0\u00b0 (Note 7). The yield of yellow crystals of dibenzoylmethane, m.p. 77\u201378\u00b0 (Note 8), thus obtained is 70\u201380 g. (62\u201371% based on the acetophenone)."

            "In a 2-l. flask, fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a soda-lime drying tube and a glass tube reaching almost to the bottom, is placed 325 g. (420 ml.) of absolute ethanol. The whole is then tared and placed in an ice bath, and the inlet tube is connected to a source of dry methylamine.\nThe methylamine generator consists of a 1-l. flask fitted with a dropping funnel and outlet tube, which in turn is connected to a 25-cm. drying tower containing soda-lime, followed by a 1-l. safety trap (Note 1). In the flask is placed 200 g. of technical sodium hydroxide flakes, and 263 g. of a 33\u201335% solution of methylamine in water (Note 2) is dropped in slowly at such a rate that an even current of gas is evolved. When the addition has been completed and the gas bubbles very slowly into the ethanol, the flask and contents are removed and weighed; the increase should be 84\u201386 g. (2.71\u20132.77 moles) (Note 3).\nThe flask is reimmersed in the ice bath, and 900\u2013925 g. (5.4\u20135.5 moles), depending upon the weight of methylamine, of a 60% solution of ethyl acrylate in ethanol (Note 4) is added in portions of about 100 ml. at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture does not rise above 40\u00b0; this requires about 10 minutes. After each addition the flask is stoppered to exclude moisture. When all the ester has been added the flask is closed by a rubber stopper and allowed to stand 6 days (Note 5).\nMost of the ethanol is removed by distillation (1.5 hours) on a steam bath, and the residue is transferred to a modified Claisen flask and distilled. The fraction boiling below 50\u00b0/20 mm. (Note 6) is removed with the aid of a water pump, and the residue is distilled using an oil pump (at 3 mm. pressure) (Note 7).

The mixture is then stirred for 3 hours at a temperature below 20\u00b0, after which it is diluted with 300 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in 1 l. of ice water. The ester which crystallizes is collected on a chilled B\u00fcchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible. The solid is transferred to a 600-ml. beaker, 250\u2013300 ml. of methanol is added, and the mixture is warmed on the steam bath until the ester melts. It is then cooled in a freezing mixture while being stirred continuously; the ester separates in a fairly fine state. It is then collected on a chilled funnel and allowed to dry in the air, preferably at a temperature below 20\u00b0. The yield of ester is 152\u2013156 g. (88\u201390% based upon the dodecanol used). It melts at 20\u201325\u00b0 (Note 2) and is sufficiently pure for most purposes.\nIf a purer product is desired, it is recrystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0), using 4 ml. per 3 g., and drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is chilled to 0\u00b0 and the ester filtered on a chilled funnel; the recovery is 90%, and the melting point is 28\u201330\u00b0. Evaporation of the solvent to a small volume deposits an additional amount (Note 3)."

Any yellow precipitate formed during the next few hours is filtered and discarded (Note 3).\nThe solution is allowed to stand for 3 days at room temperature, and is then concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure (water pump) until spattering makes further evaporation impossible. Two hundred milliliters of water is added to the residue, and the contents of the flask are washed into a small beaker where they are stirred to a smooth slurry. The product is filtered, washed thoroughly on the funnel with cold water, and dried in an oven at 80\u201390\u00b0. The crude material melts at 204\u2013206\u00b0 and weighs 47\u201357 g. (80\u201396%). It is purified by recrystallization from 650 ml. of boiling methanol using 5 g. of decolorizing charcoal.

(0.87 gram atom) of sodium (Note 1) in large pieces. The reaction is kept under control by cooling the flask in a pan of ice water. To the resulting solution of sodium methoxide is added a solution (Note 2) of 61 g. of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.88 mole) in 20 ml. of water; during the addition the mixture is swirled in order to avoid spattering. After 20 minutes the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 and filtered with suction. The sodium chloride is washed with 350 ml. of anhydrous methanol. The combined filtrate and washings are warmed to 65\u00b0 in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, and a solution of 100 g. of finely powdered commercial crystalline glucose monohydrate (0.50 mole) in 200 ml. of warm 25% aqueous methanol is added, with stirring. The resulting solution is held at 65\u00b0 for 2 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure until no further distillate is obtained; the residue weighs 155\u2013160 g. The resulting syrup (Note 3) is diluted with 300 ml. of methanol and again distilled, and this process is repeated once (Note 4).\nA mixture of 100 g. of powdered, anhydrous sodium acetate and 677 ml. of 90% acetic anhydride (Note 5) is heated on a steam bath in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask under an efficient reflux condenser. Without interrupting the heating a solution of the syrupy glucose oxime in 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 100 ml. of cold acetic anhydride is added through a dropping funnel to the hot mixture (Note 6); this requires about 1 hour (Note 7). Heating is continued for another hour, and the bulk (380\u2013420 ml.) of the acetic acid and any unchanged acetic anhydride is distilled under reduced pressure from a water bath. The residue is immediately stirred into 2 l. of cold water, stirred occasionally during the first 3 hours, and allowed to stand overnight.\nAfter the mixture has been chilled to 0\u00b0, the brown, crystalline mass is filtered with suction and washed with 500 ml. of water. The solid is dissolved in 300 ml. of hot 95% ethanol, and the solution is heated with 10\u201315 g. of Norit for 5 minutes and filtered with suction. The filtrate is gradually cooled to 0\u00b0; the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with 20 ml. of cold ethanol. The weight of the first crop is 90\u201393 g. A second crop is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor under reduced pressure to 25 ml., boiling the solution with Norit, filtering, and chilling the filtrate to 0\u00b0. The total yield of colorless pentaacetyl d-glucononitrile melting at 82.5\u201383.5\u00b0 is 95\u201396 g. (50%)."

The heavy oil that separates is extracted with 2.4 l. of chloroform (Note 5), and the aqueous layer is again extracted with 600 ml. of chloroform. The chloroform solutions are combined, washed three times with water, and carefully dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 6).\nThe solution, filtered to remove the drying agent, is placed in a 4-l. beaker and warmed to 50\u00b0. The beaker is then exposed to direct sunlight (Note 7), and 450 g. (2.81 moles) of bromine is added with stirring (Note 8) as fast as it is used. The reaction starts slowly but accelerates rapidly, and considerable heat is evolved. The temperature of the solution should be kept below 55\u00b0 (Note 9).

Two liters of water is added, and the solution is concentrated to dryness. The cake is dissolved in 1.5 l. of 48% hydrobromic acid and refluxed for 2.5 hours. The resulting dark solution is concentrated to a volume of about 500 ml. and then cooled under the tap. The precipitated ammonium bromide is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to a thick syrup (Note 16). One liter of water is added, and the solution is again concentrated to a thick syrup. The syrupy residue is dissolved in 375 ml. of warm water, and ammonium hydroxide is added carefully until a faint odor of ammonia persists after vigorous shaking. One and one-half liters of absolute ethanol is then added slowly (Note 17), and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The crude serine is filtered and the filtrate discarded. The precipitate is dissolved in 500 ml. of boiling water (Note 18), heated on the steam cone for 10 minutes with 10\u201315 g. of Darco (Note 19), and then filtered. Five hundred milliliters of absolute ethanol is added to the filtrate slowly with stirring. The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 and is kept at this temperature for 1 hour with occasional stirring to ensure formation of a finely divided precipitate (Note 20). The serine is filtered, washed with ethanol and ether, and air-dried. The precipitates from several runs may be combined and recrystallized as above from 50% ethanol until a white product is obtained (one or two recrystallizations).\nAll the filtrates should be combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue should be recrystallized as above. The last concentrates (including filter paper and Darco washings), if quite dark, may be precipitated from 70% ethanol before recrystallizing. By this process a nearly quantitative recovery may be effected.\nThe over-all yield is 30 to 40% of the theoretical amount based on the mercuric acetate (Note 21)."

            "The apparatus is assembled as shown in Fig. 27. Ammonia gas from a commercial cylinder (Note 1) enters the system at K. R is a mercury trap which would serve as a safety valve if the system should become blocked by solidification of the amide owing to an accidental drop in temperature. J is a U-tube containing just enough mercury to seal the bend, and it serves to estimate the rate of ammonia flow. I is a Kjeldahl trap which prevents any mercury from being thrown into the fusion pot A, which (Note 2) is conveniently supported on a tripod set on bricks to raise it to a convenient height above the burner M. Through the cover of the fusion pot passes an outlet tube B, a thermometer well T, and the combined inlet tube CDE. The thermometer well is welded shut at the bottom and projects about 6 mm. below the wider inlet tube, to which it is welded at the top. A gland or packed joint O, through which the inlet passes, is packed with a few turns of asbestos cord, the upper hexagonal nut being turned down with a wrench so that ammonia will not escape past the packing and so that there will be sufficient resistance to hold CDE in any position to which it may be raised (Note 3). The rubber tubes H, H' should be of sufficient length (5\u20137 cm.) to be very flexible and facilitate manipulation of the hot cover. The outlet tube B is at least 10 mm. in diameter.\nFig. 27.\nAt the outset of the run the pot A, with the thermometer well in the position shown in the diagram, is heated to about 120\u00b0 for 10 minutes in a slow stream of ammonia (Note 4). This serves to sweep the air and any traces of moisture from the system. The apparatus is then allowed to cool to 70\u201380\u00b0, the cover is removed, and a 250-ml. nickel crucible F is placed in the pot. The ammonia inlet CDE is raised to just above the top of the nickel crucible, in which is then placed approximately 175 g. (7.6 gram atoms) of clean sodium (Note 5). The pot is now heated with the full flame of the burner; the sodium melts in 5\u201310 minutes, whereupon the inlet tube CDE is pushed through the gland until it rests on the bottom of the crucible. When the temperature has reached 320\u00b0, the burner is turned down and adjusted to maintain the temperature at 350\u2013360\u00b0. The ammonia flow is regulated so that the bubbles in J are just too rapid to count. After 3.5\u20134 hours (Note 6) and (Note 7), the temperature is lowered to about 320\u00b0, and the cover is lifted enough to see whether any unreacted metal remains; if none remains, the flame is removed and the crucible allowed to cool to 230\u2013240\u00b0; at this temperature the burner is replaced and heating continued for 30 minutes to ensure removal of the bulk of the sodium hydride.\nThe burner is now extinguished, the ammonia shut off, and the pot cover removed by disconnecting at H, H'. The crucible is removed from the pot with tongs, and the molten amide is poured into a shallow iron tray, which has previously been heated to remove traces of moisture (Note 8). At this point it is essential to work rapidly to avoid solidification of the amide in the crucible (Note 9). As soon as the product has solidified sufficiently, the tray is transferred to a large desiccator to cool. When cold enough to handle, the tray is inverted on a clean heavy paper; the amide is removed by rapping the bottom of the pan and is at once transferred to convenient wide-mouthed bottles and covered with a petroleum fraction (Note 10) and (Note 11). The yields vary from 267 to 282 g. (90\u201395%) (Note 12), (Note 13), and (Note 14).\nThe sodium amide thus prepared is easily pulverized; it may be ground in a mortar under any hydrocarbon solvent. It is safer, though not necessary, where ether is to be used as a reaction medium, to grind the amide first under a hydrocarbon, the mixture being transferred to the reaction flask and then replaced by ether in the usual way (Note 15), (Note 16), and (Note 17)."

After a second recrystallization from 1 l. of chloroform, 190\u2013200 g. of light-gray crystals melting at 168\u2013170\u00b0 is obtained. An additional 15\u201320 g. may be obtained by concentrating the chloroform filtrate to 250 ml. and recrystallizing the precipitate from fresh chloroform. The total yield is 205\u2013220 g. (51\u201355%).",
            "B. Terephthalaldehyde. A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a still head, capillary ebullition tube, and receiver in an assembly for a vacuum distillation. Into the flask are introduced 84.3 g. (0.2 mole) of finely powdered tetrabromo-p-xylene and 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (95%). The reactants are thoroughly mixed by shaking. A vacuum is applied by means of a water pump, and a stream of air is allowed to pass through the capillary tube in order to facilitate the rapid removal of hydrogen bromide. The flask is heated in an oil bath to 70\u00b0, and, as the evolution of gas becomes less vigorous, the temperature of the bath is gradually raised to 110\u00b0 (Note 3). The reaction is complete when a perfectly clear solution is obtained and no more gas is evolved (about 2.5 hours). The flask is then cooled and the contents are poured on 600 g. of crushed ice. The crystalline solid is collected on a filter, washed with a little water, and recrystallized from 600 ml. of 10% methanol with the aid of 1 g. of decolorizing carbon to remove the yellow color. The small amount of tetrabromoxylene which remains undissolved is separated with the carbon and washed on the filter with two 100-ml. portions of hot 10% methanol. The yield of pure product, m.p. 115\u2013116\u00b0, is 21.7\u201322.5 g. (81\u201384%)."

(0.134 mole) of molten \u03b3-phenylbutyric acid (Note 2), previously warmed to 65\u201370\u00b0. The mixture is removed from the steam bath and is stirred steadily by hand for 3 minutes; during this time a temperature of 90\u00b0 or slightly higher is maintained by the heat of the reaction. An additional 70 g. of polyphosphoric acid is then added, and the mixture is again warmed on a steam bath for 4 minutes while being stirred vigorously by hand. The resulting solution is allowed to cool to 60\u00b0, and is hydrolyzed by addition to 200 g. of ice and water.\nWhen the hydrolysis is complete, as indicated by the disappearance of orange, viscous material and the appearance in its stead of yellow oil, the aqueous mixture is transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel and extracted with two portions of ether, 200 ml. and 100 ml., respectively.

            "This preparation must be carried out in a hood having good ventilation. Methyl sulfate has a high vapor pressure in spite of its high boiling point and is very poisonous. Ammonia is a specific antidote and should be kept on hand to destroy any of the ester accidentally spilled. It is advisable to wash the hands in dilute ammonium hydroxide frequently.\nIn a 2-l. distilling flask immersed in a 4-l. water bath are placed 25 g. (0.14 mole) of anhydrous glucose (Note 1) and 15 ml. of water. The flask is fitted with a cork through which passes a strong mechanical stirrer (Note 2) and a dropping tube connected by rubber tubing and a screw clamp to a 500-ml. reservoir flask. The side tube of the flask is connected to a water condenser, fitted with a suction flask, from which fumes are led to a flue by a piece of tubing. The temperature of the water bath is raised to 55\u00b0, and the glucose is brought into solution with rapid stirring, which is maintained throughout the process. A mixture of 90 ml. (120 g., 9.5 moles) of methyl sulfate and 125 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is added from the reservoir as quickly as possible to the flask. The clamp is closed, and 400 ml. (580 g.) of 40% (by weight) sodium hydroxide is placed in the reservoir. The alkali is admitted to the flask at the rate of 1 drop in 2 seconds for 5 minutes, then 1 drop per second for 5 minutes, and then 3 drops per second until the distillation of carbon tetrachloride slackens or ceases. This is usually accomplished in 15\u201320 minutes and after the addition of 70\u201390 ml. of alkali. The heat of reaction generally maintains the proper temperature of 50\u201355\u00b0 throughout this stage without the necessity of heating the water bath externally. The remainder of the alkali is added as quickly as possible, and the bath temperature raised to and maintained at 70\u201375\u00b0. Then 160 ml. (208 g., 1.65 moles) of methyl sulfate is placed in the reservoir immediately and added at the rate of 3\u20134 drops per second (slower if the mixture foams seriously).\nAfter all the methyl sulfate has been added, the bath is boiled for 30 minutes with continued stirring. The contents of the flask are cooled, diluted with sufficient water to dissolve most of the separated sodium sulfate, and extracted four times with 150-ml. portions of chloroform; the chloroform and water layers are separated carefully. The combined chloroform extracts (Note 3) are placed in a 2- or 3-l. distilling flask (with condenser attached) with 400 ml. of 2 N hydrochloric acid, and the chloroform is removed by distillation. A rapid current of steam is then passed through the solution for 1 hour, care being taken to maintain the volume approximately constant by heating the flask. Five grams of Norite is added to the hot solution, which is then cooled and filtered. The filtrate is saturated with sodium sulfate and extracted four times with 150-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried with sodium sulfate, 1 g. of Norit is added, and the mixture is filtered. The chloroform is removed as completely as possible in a boiling water bath without vacuum and finally at the water pump. The heavy syrup is treated with 40\u201350 ml. of petroleum ether (30\u201360\u00b0) and shaken for a short time, whereupon it sets to a mass of crystals. After cooling in an ice bath for 30 minutes, the crystals are filtered, washed with a little cold petroleum ether, and dried over calcium chloride under reduced pressure. The yield is 15\u201318 g. (46\u201355%) (Note 3). The specific rotation, [\u03b1]D26, in water was found to be about +79\u201379.5\u00b0, when c = 4; a drop of 15% ammonia was added to speed equilibration, and the readings were made 1 hour after the solution was prepared in a 2-dm. tube.\nThe slightly impure product is recrystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) containing 0.5% of anhydrous ether in a continuous extractor, using 100 ml. of solvent per 6\u20137 g. of compound. One crystallization is generally sufficient to give a pure product. The specific rotation of pure tetramethyl-d-glucose prepared by this method is approximately [\u03b1]D20 +81.3\u00b0 (Note 4)."

The flask is warmed on a steam cone and shaken vigorously until the mercuric acetate dissolves (about 10 minutes). The solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 hours (Note 3), then the precipitate is filtered, washed twice with 300-ml. portions of methanol, and air-dried. The yield is 625\u2013650 g. (Note 4). This material is powdered and dissolved in a solution of 360 g. (3 moles) of potassium bromide in 2 l. of water, and the solution is placed in a 4-l. beaker, which is cooled in an ice bath and exposed to direct sunlight (Note 5). A solution of 320 g. (2 moles) of bromine and 360 g. (3 moles) of potassium bromide in 600 ml. of water is added with stirring during 20\u201340 minutes, a large excess of bromine being avoided. After 10\u201315 minutes' standing, any excess bromine is destroyed with sodium bisulfite. The bromo acids are isolated as follows: The solution is extracted once with 300 ml. of ether to remove a small amount of lachrymatory material and, after acidification with 400 ml. of 40% hydrobromic acid, is extracted again with six 800-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed once with a small volume of cold water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, leaving the crude bromo acid mixture.\nThe yield of crude bromo acids is 350\u2013370 g. (88\u201393% based on the crotonic acid used in the first step). This material is used without purification in the preparation of aminomethoxybutyric acid.\nThe crude bromo acids may be freed from impurities by fractionation under reduced pressure. The fraction distilling below 125\u00b0/10 mm. (105\u00b0/3 mm.) is discarded; the remainder distils at 125\u2013128\u00b0/10 mm. (105\u2013107\u00b0/3 mm.) and consists of a mixture of stereoisomeric acids. The yield is 75\u201385% based on the crotonic acid used in the first step.",

One hundred and seventy-five grams of crude bromomethoxybutyric acid is heated with 2 l. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide for 6 hours at 90\u2013100\u00b0 in a glass-lined autoclave (p. 777) (Note 6), The solution is concentrated to a thick gum under reduced pressure (Note 7), water is added, and the solution is reconcentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is allowed to stand under acetone with frequent shaking (Note 8) until the material has crystallized completely (1\u20132 days). The acetone is decanted, and the residue dissolved in 1 l. of 85\u201390% formic acid (Note 9). The solution is warmed to 45\u00b0, and 350 g. (330 ml.) of acetic anhydride is added with stirring during 10 minutes. The heat of reaction causes the temperature of the solution to rise to 70\u201380\u00b0, and the temperature of the mixture is maintained within this range for about 15 minutes. The solution is next evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved, while being warmed on the steam bath, in the minimum amount of water (Note 10), and the solution is cooled overnight in the icebox. The crystals are filtered and air-dried. This material is a mixture of formyl derivatives (Note 11). One recrystallization from 150 ml. of hot water yields about 25 g. of practically pure formyl-dl-O-methylthreonine melting at 174\u2013176\u00b0. An additional 3\u20135 g. is obtained by working up the filtrates. The yield is 25% (Note 12).\nTwenty-five grams (0.16 mole) of formyl-dl-O-methylthreonine is refluxed for 2 hours with 360 ml. of constant-boiling hydrobromic acid. The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (Note 13). Sufficient water is added to dissolve all the residue, and the solution is reconcentrated under reduced pressure. The gummy residue is next dissolved in 450 ml. of absolute ethanol, and concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added until the odor of ammonia persists after vigorous shaking. The solution is cooled in the icebox overnight, and the crystals are filtered and dissolved in 3 volumes of hot water (about 5 ml. of water per gram of crude material). Seven volumes of absolute ethanol are added, and the solution is cooled to room temperature with scratching of the flask to induce crystallization. It is then cooled in an icebox overnight. The crystals are filtered and washed twice with 90-ml. portions of absolute ethanol and once with ether. The yield is 18\u201320 g.

            "A. \u03b1-Bromoisovaleric acid. One kilogram of commercial isovaleric acid monohydrate is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask together with 500 ml. of benzene. The water and benzene are distilled, using a short column, until the temperature of the vapor reaches 100\u00b0. The temperature rises rapidly when the benzene is removed. The residue is cooled, and 878 g. (934 ml., 8.6 moles) of it is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a long reflux condenser. The top of the condenser is connected by glass tubing to an empty 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask which acts as a safety trap. A second outlet on the Erlenmeyer flask connects to a gas-absorption trap (Note 1). One and five-tenths kilograms (480 ml.) of dry bromine (Note 2) is added to the acid, and then 15 ml. of phosphorus trichloride is added through the top of the condenser.\nThe mixture is heated on an oil bath at 70\u201380\u00b0 for 10\u201320 hours or until the condenser no longer shows the deep red color of bromine. Another 25-ml. portion of bromine is added and the flask heated as before. When the color has again disappeared, the temperature of the bath is slowly raised to 100\u2013105\u00b0 and maintained there for 1.5\u20132 hours.\nThe crude bromo acid is placed in a 2-l. modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The low-boiling fraction is mainly unbrominated acid (Note 3). The fraction boiling at 110\u2013125\u00b0/15 mm. is collected. The yield is 1364\u20131380 g. (87.5\u201388.6%).",
            "B. dl-Valine. To 2 l. of technical ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask is added 330 g. (1.82 moles) of \u03b1-bromoisovaleric acid. A stopper is wired in and the flask allowed to stand at room temperature for a week. The contents from three such amination flasks are combined in a 12-l. flask, and the ammonia is removed by heating on the steam cone overnight. The solution is then concentrated to a thin paste (about 800 ml.) by means of a water pump (Note 4). The solid material is collected on a filter and, when dry, amounts to 470 g. This is recrystallized by dissolving in 2.4 l. of water heated to 95\u00b0 on a steam cone, treating with 10 g. of Norit for 30 minutes, filtering hot, adding an equal volume of 95% ethanol, and cooling overnight in the icebox. The valine is collected on a filter and washed with 150 ml. of cold absolute ethanol. The yield is 200\u2013235 g. A second crop is obtained by evaporating the filtrate from the recrystallization on the water pump until crystals form, adding an equal volume of 95% ethanol, and cooling as before. The amino acid obtained in this way amounts to 34 g.\nThe second filtrate from the recrystallization together with the filtrate from the original concentration is evaporated to dryness and extracted with 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid on a steam cone. The inorganic salts are filtered and the acetic acid is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. One liter of water is added, and it, too, is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. This operation is repeated. These three distillations require 1 day. The residue is dissolved in the minimum amount of hot water (about 300 ml.). The solution is then treated with Norit as before and filtered hot, and an equal volume of 95% ethanol is added. The yield on cooling overnight in the icebox is 34 g. An additional 8 g. can be obtained from the mother liquor by concentration and addition of ethanol as was done with the original mother liquor. The total yield of valine is 300\u2013311 g. (47\u201348%), which decomposes at 280\u2013282\u00b0 in a sealed capillary (Note 5) and (Note 6)."
