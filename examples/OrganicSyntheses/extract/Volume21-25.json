            "A. Acenaphthenol acetate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 154 g. (1 mole) of acenaphthene (Note 1) and 1.1 l. of glacial acetic acid (Note 2). The flask is fitted with a tantalum or Nichrome wire stirrer1 and a thermometer extending below the surface of the liquid. The solution is stirred and heated to 60\u00b0, at which point the source of heat is removed and 820 g. of red lead (Note 3) is added in portions of about 50 g., each portion being added as soon as the color due to the previous portion has been discharged. During this operation, which requires 30\u201340 minutes, the temperature is maintained at 60\u201370 (Note 4) by external cooling. The reaction is complete when a portion of the solution gives no test for lead tetraacetate (Note 5). The dark red syrupy solution (which may contain a few suspended particles of red lead and lead dioxide) is poured into 2 l. of water contained in a 4-l. separatory funnel. The acetate is extracted with a 350-ml. portion of ether and then with a 250-ml. portion. The total extract is washed first with 100 ml. of water, then with 300 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and is finally dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed colorless with three 50-ml. portions of dry ether. The combined filtrate and washings are placed in a 500-ml. Claisen flask with an inset side arm, and, after distillation of the solvent, the acetate is distilled under reduced pressure. The acetate distils almost entirely at 166\u2013168\u00b0/5 mm. (bath temperature 180\u2013185\u00b0, raised to 220\u00b0 at the end) as a mobile yellow oil. The yield is 170\u2013175 g. (80\u201382%) (Note 6).",
            "B. Acenaphthenol. The acetate obtained as above is dissolved in 275 ml. of methanol in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and a solution of 40 g. (1.2 equiv.) of sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water is added (Note 7). This mixture is refluxed for 2 hours (Note 7) and then cooled below 20\u00b0. The yellow crystalline acenaphthenol is collected on a filter and washed well with about 1.5 l. of water. The crude product is air-dried (138\u2013143 g.) and then dissolved in 2 l. of boiling benzene. The solution is treated with 6\u20138 g. of decolorizing carbon (Note 8) and filtered through a heated funnel. The orange-red filtrate is concentrated to about 1 l., and the acenaphthenol is allowed to crystallize. After filtering with suction and washing with cold benzene (about 500 ml.) until the wash solvent is colorless, the acenaphthenol is obtained as practically colorless needles, m.p. 144.5\u2013145.5\u00b0 (cor.) (Note 9). It weighs 117\u2013121 g. From the filtrate may be obtained an additional quantity of material which on one recrystallization gives only 3\u20135 g. of pure acenaphthenol. The total yield amounts to 120\u2013126 g. (70\u201374% based on the acenaphthene)."

The temperature of the solution in the cells is maintained at 20\u201330\u00b0 by surrounding them with a bath of cool water (Note 4). The reduction is complete after 60\u201370 ampere-hours. This fact is indicated by the increased evolution of hydrogen and the complete solution of the anthranilic acid.\nThe cathode liquid is removed from the cells and neutralized with solid ammonium carbonate or concentrated aqueous ammonia.

When all the alloy has been added (about 2 hours is required) the stirrer is stopped, the beaker is removed from the ice bath, and the contents are allowed to come to room temperature. After the evolution of hydrogen becomes slow, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand on a steam bath until the evolution of hydrogen again becomes slow (about 8\u201312 hours). The heating should not be too rapid at the beginning or the solution may foam over. During this time the volume of the solution is maintained constant by adding distilled water if necessary. After heating, the nickel is allowed to settle and most of the liquid is decanted. Distilled water is then added to bring the solution to the original volume; the nickel is suspended by stirring, again allowed to settle, and the solution is decanted. The nickel is then transferred to a 2-l. beaker (Note 5) with the aid of distilled water, and the water is again decanted. A solution of 50 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 ml. of distilled water is added; the catalyst is suspended and allowed to settle; and the alkali is decanted. The nickel is washed by suspension in distilled water and decantation until the washings are neutral to litmus and then ten times more to remove the alkali completely (twenty to forty washings are required) (Note 6). The washing process is repeated three times with 200 ml. of 95% ethanol and three times with absolute ethanol; the catalyst is then stored under absolute ethanol in bottles which are completely filled with absolute ethanol and tightly closed (Note 7). The product is highly pyrophoric and must be kept under a liquid at all times. The Raney nickel contained in the suspension weighs about 150 g. (Note 8).\nTo prepare the catalyst under methylcyclohexane (Note 9), the catalyst, which has been prepared as above and washed free of alkali with water, but to which no ethanol has been added, is covered with 1 l. of methylcyclohexane which is distilled from an oil bath until all the water has been codistilled with the hydrocarbon, more of the methylcyclohexane being added from time to time so that the nickel always remains covered. When the catalyst is free from water it becomes freely suspended in the liquid.\nTo prepare nickel under dioxane, dioxane (Note 10) is used in place of the methylcyclohexane above and the distillation is continued until the temperature of the vapor reaches 101\u00b0. (Caution. Do not use nickel in dioxane above 210\u00b0; the dioxane may react almost explosively with hydrogen and Raney nickel above this temperature.)"

            "A. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (I). In a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the bottom, and a dropping funnel, is placed 2 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and when the temperature falls below 10\u00b0 a solution of 220 g. (2 moles) of resorcinol in 260 g. (2 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate is added dropwise. The mixture is stirred, and the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0 by means of ice and salt. After all the solution has been added (about 2 hours) the reaction mixture is set aside for 12\u201324 hours without further cooling. The reaction mixture is now poured with vigorous stirring into a mixture of 4 kg. of ice and 6 l. of water. The precipitate is collected on a filter and washed with three 50-ml. portions of cold water. The crude product is then dissolved in 3 l. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the solution is filtered, and the substituted coumarin is reprecipitated from the filtrate by the slow addition of dilute (1:10) sulfuric acid until the solution is acid to litmus. About 1.1 l. of dilute sulfuric acid is required. During the neutralization, the reaction mixture must be well stirred. The product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with four 50-ml. portions of cold water, and dried. The yield of 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin is 290\u2013320 g. (82\u201390%). It is sufficiently pure for use in the next step but may be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol using about 15 ml. of ethanol for 5 g. of product. The recrystallized material forms stout almost colorless needles melting at 185\u00b0.",
            "B. 4-Methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin (II). A mixture of 286 g. (1.6 moles) of crude, dry 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin and 572 g. (5.6 moles) of acetic anhydride is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted to a reflux condenser by a ground-glass joint. The mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hours, cooled to about 50\u00b0, and poured with vigorous stirring into a mixture of 4 kg. of cracked ice and 4 l. of water. The precipitate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with five 50-ml. portions of cold water, and spread on absorbent paper to dry. The drying is completed by placing the product in a steam oven for 10 hours. The yield of crude 4-methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin is 320\u2013340 g. (90\u201396%). It may be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol (5 g. of compound to 20 ml. of solvent) and forms fibrous needles melting at 150\u2013151\u00b0. The crude oven-dried product is finely powdered and used in the next step.",
            "C. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin (III). In a clean, dry, 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 200 g. (0.92 mole) of dry, powdered 4-methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin and 453 g. (3.4 moles) of technical anhydrous aluminum chloride. The flask is stoppered and shaken vigorously for 3\u20135 minutes in order to mix the ingredients thoroughly. The stopper is removed and the flask attached to a reflux condenser fitted with a gas-absorption tube. The flask is placed in an oil bath the temperature of which is raised quickly to 125\u00b0 and then slowly over a period of 2 hours to 170\u00b0. At the end of this time the flask is removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool, and immersed in an ice bath. About 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and then 2.4 l. of dilute (1:7) hydrochloric acid is added over a period of about 2 hours. The mixture is then heated on a steam bath for 30 minutes with vigorous stirring in order to effect complete decomposition. The mixture is filtered and the precipitate washed with four 50-ml. portions of cold water and sucked dry. This crude product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 4 l. of hot 95% ethanol, filtering the hot solution through a warm funnel, and chilling the filtrate. The crystals are collected on a funnel and air-dried. The product melts at 162\u2013163\u00b0, and the yield is 145\u2013155 g. (72.5\u201377.0%) (Note 1).",
            "D. 2,6-Dihydroxyacetophenone (IV). A 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a glass tube, extending to the bottom of the flask, connected to a cylinder of nitrogen (Note 2). In the flask are placed 148 g. (0.68 mole) of 4-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin and 500 ml. of distilled water. A rapid stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the water suspension until all the air in the apparatus is displaced, and then a slow stream of the gas is kept passing through the solution (Note 3). A solution of 129 g. (3.23 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 580 ml. of water is added through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is heated on a steam bath for 5 hours. The solution is then cooled and acidified by the addition of about 1 l. of dilute (1:3) hydrochloric acid. The stream of nitrogen gas is continued throughout the period of heating and while the solution is cooling. It may be stopped after the solution is acid. The crude 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone which separates on acidification is collected on a filter, washed three times with 50-ml. portions of cold water, and air-dried. A yield of 90\u201395 g. (87\u201392% based on the 4-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin) of light-yellow solid is obtained.\nThe purification is accomplished by dissolving the crude product in 1 l. of 95% ethanol, adding 20 g. of Norit, and heating the mixture on a steam cone for 15 minutes with occasional shaking. After this time, 800 ml. of warm water is added, and the solution is heated 5 more minutes and filtered through a hot funnel. The greenish filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath, and the first crop (about 65 g.) of lemon-yellow needles of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone is removed by filtration. The filtrate is then concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 800 ml., again chilled, and the second crop of product (about 15 g.) collected on a filter. The total yield of purified 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone, melting at 154\u2013155\u00b0, is 75\u201385 g. (a recovery of 83\u201389%) (Note 4)."

            "To 200 g. (1.64 moles) of benzoic acid in a 1-l. Kjeldahl flask, in the top of which is inserted a loosely fitting cold finger (Note 1), is added 500 ml. of fuming sulfuric acid (Note 2). The mixture is heated in an oil bath for 5 hours at 240\u2013250\u00b0 (bath temperature).\nAfter standing overnight the syrupy liquid is poured slowly with stirring into 3 kg. of ice in a 3-gal. crock (Note 3). The solution is then neutralized by adding barium carbonate in 100-g. portions, stirring occasionally until the gas evolution slackens before each addition: 2.4\u20132.5 kg. is required. The pasty mass is filtered by suction on a 30-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the barium sulfate is washed with five 300-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrates are evaporated nearly to dryness on a steam bath and finally dried in an oven at 125\u2013140\u00b0 (Note 4). The yield of crude barium salt is 640\u2013800 g.\nThe operator should wear goggles and long-sleeved gloves during the next two operations. The dried, pulverized barium salt is introduced in 200-g. portions into a melt of 600 g. each of sodium and potassium hydroxides contained in a 14 by 20 cm. copper beaker. The mixture is stirred with a copper stirrer and the temperature determined with a thermometer in a copper well. (Note 5). Each portion is well stirred in before the next is added. The temperature is then slowly raised to 250\u2013260\u00b0, at which point a vigorous reaction occurs with copious evolution of gas. After this has slackened (about 30 minutes) the temperature is raised to 280\u2013310\u00b0 and maintained there for 1 hour, then allowed to drop to 200\u00b0. The melt is ladled into 6 l. of water (Note 6) and (Note 7). The barium sulfite is filtered by suction, and the filtrate is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 2.5 l. is required).\nThe resulting solution (about 9 l.) is divided into two portions and each is extracted three times, 600 ml. of ether being used each time (Note 8). The combined extracts are concentrated to about 1 l. and dried overnight over 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration and evaporation of the ether, there remains 137\u2013160 g. (58\u201365%) of a slightly colored product, melting with decomposition at 227\u2013229\u00b0. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

            "A. 3,3'-Dimethoxybiphenyl. In a 1.5-l. beaker are placed 400 ml. of water and 31 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This solution is heated to boiling, the flame is removed, and 40 g. (0.16 mole) of o-dianisidine (Note 1) is added. The hot mixture is stirred for about 3 minutes, until only a small amount of solid remains. The beaker is then placed in an ice-salt mixture and its contents are stirred mechanically until the temperature has dropped to about 15\u00b0. At this point 35 ml. more of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. When the temperature of the mixture has fallen to 10\u201313\u00b0, a solution of 23.3 g. (0.33 mole) of 97% sodium nitrite (or an equivalent amount of sodium nitrite of higher or lower purity) in 50 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel in the course of 10\u201315 minutes. The contents of the beaker are then stirred for 15\u201320 minutes at 5\u201310\u00b0, and finally filtered rapidly with suction from an appreciable amount of dark material (Note 2).\nThe cold, clear red filtrate is now poured rapidly into a 2-l. flask containing 325 ml. of ice-cold 30% hypophosphorous acid solution (Note 3). Immediate evolution of nitrogen occurs. The flask is stoppered loosely, placed in a refrigerator for 8\u201310 hours, and then allowed to stand at room temperature for another 8\u201310 hours (Note 4). The reaction product is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the lower dark brown layer is separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 125-ml. portions of ether (Note 5). The brown oil combined with the ether extracts is washed in a separatory funnel with two 30-ml. portions of 20% sodium hydroxide solution (Note 6). Separation into two layers occurs rapidly, but occasionally the aqueous phase will remain turbid for some time. The loss by discarding the turbid sodium hydroxide washings is negligible. The ether solution is dried with a minimal amount of anhydrous potassium carbonate, 5 g. usually being sufficient (Note 7).\nAfter filtration of the ether solution from the mixture of solid potassium carbonate and dark solids which have settled out, the ether is removed by distillation on a steam cone from a 50-ml. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. column. Usually suction must be applied to remove the last traces of ether. The residue is distilled at 4 mm. and a bath temperature of 200\u00b0. There is a small fore-run of 1\u20131.5 g. of a very pale yellow liquid which distils at 155\u2013157\u00b0. The main fraction, boiling at 157\u2013159\u00b0, is practically colorless and weighs 19\u201322 g. When the temperature of the thermometer in the flask starts to drop, the bath temperature is gradually raised to 240\u00b0. In this way, 3\u20134 g. more of light orange-yellow dianisyl is obtained. The yield based on the three fractions is 23\u201327.5 g. (66\u201378%). The fractions usually crystallize spontaneously; if they do not crystallize, they are cooled and scratched.\nThe main fraction melts at 41\u201343\u00b0 (Note 8), and the other two fractions usually melt about a degree or two lower. The product is pure enough for most purposes; it may be recrystallized from the minimal volume of ethanol necessary for solution at 45\u201350\u00b0. The solution is cooled to about 35\u00b0; any oil that precipitates is brought back into solution by cautious addition of ethanol. The saturated solution is seeded, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then kept in a refrigerator for at least 4 hours. In this manner, 20\u201321 g. of flat, colorless needles is obtained; the product melts at 42\u201343.5\u00b0.",
            "B. 3,3'-Dimethylbiphenyl. Twenty-seven grams (0.13 mole) of o-tolidine (Note 9) is tetrazotized according to Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 145 (1943). It is not necessary to take the indicated precautions against a slight excess of nitrous acid. The clear orange tetrazonium solution is added to 290 ml. of 30% hypophosphorous acid (Note 10), and the mixture is allowed to stand, loosely stoppered, at room temperature for 16\u201318 hours (Note 11).\nThe reaction product is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the red oily layer is separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 60 ml. of benzene. The combined red oil and benzene extract are dried with 1\u20135 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 12). The benzene is removed by distillation from a 50-ml. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. column. The flask is heated in an oil bath to a final temperature of about 150\u00b0 to ensure removal of the last traces of benzene. The residue is distilled at 3 mm. and a bath temperature of 155\u00b0. A practically colorless fore-run of 1\u20131.5 g. comes over from 109\u00b0 to 114\u00b0. This is followed by 15.5\u201316 g. of a very pale lemon-yellow liquid which boils at 114\u2013115\u00b0. When the temperature of the thermometer in the flask starts to fall the bath temperature is raised to 170\u00b0, and an additional 1\u20131.5 g. of light lemon-yellow material is obtained (Note 13). The total yield is 17.5\u201319 g. (76\u201382%) (Note 14) and (Note 15)."

Vigreux column fitted to a condenser and receiver protected by a calcium chloride tube, are placed 345 g. (400 ml.) of dry xylene, 120 g. (117 ml., 1 mole) of dry acetophenone, and 135 g. (0.55 mole) of aluminum tert-butoxide (p. 48) (Note 2). The stirrer is started and the flask heated in an oil bath so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is held between 133\u00b0 and 137\u00b0. tert-Butyl alcohol slowly distils at a temperature in the vapor of 80\u201385\u00b0. The distillation of the alcohol can be accomplished by maintaining the temperature of the heating bath between 150\u00b0 and 155\u00b0 for 2 hours after distillation has commenced (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to 100\u00b0, and 40 ml. of water is added cautiously in small portions with continued stirring. As the water is added the mixture sets to a gel, and then, upon the addition of the remainder of the water and gentle tapping of the reaction flask, the stiff mass breaks up and boiling begins. Refluxing is continued by heating the oil bath for another 15 minutes to ensure the complete hydrolysis of the aluminum tert-butoxide.\nAfter cooling, the reaction mixture is transferred in nearly equal portions to four centrifuge bottles and the aluminum hydroxide is centrifuged out (Note 5). The upper liquid layer is removed, and the aluminum hydroxide is worked up to a smooth paste, by means of a spatula, with a total of approximately 250 ml. of ether for the four portions. The aluminum hydroxide is again centrifuged out and the ether extract poured off. The centrifuging is repeated three more times so that approximately a liter of ether is used to separate the product from the aluminum hydroxide (Note 6).\nEther and tert-butyl alcohol are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure without a column, and the xylene is removed by distillation through a 35-cm. Vigreux column at 25\u201350 mm. The residue is transferred to a smaller flask, and the acetophenone is first distilled at about 80\u00b0/10 mm., and finally the dypnone is distilled at 150\u2013155\u00b0/1 mm.

            "In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted (Note 1) with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a stirrer (Note 2) are placed 24 g. (1.05 gram atoms) of oxide-free sodium and 200 ml. of xylene (Note 3). The condenser is protected by a drying tube containing soda-lime. The flask is surrounded by an oil bath which is heated until the sodium is melted. The stirrer is started, and, after the sodium is powdered, the oil bath is removed. When the contents of the flask have cooled to room temperature, the stirrer is stopped, the xylene decanted, and the sodium washed with 100 ml. of dry ether to remove traces of xylene.\nThe flask is replaced and completely surrounded by an ice bath (Note 4). A current of nitrogen is passed through the flask for 5 minutes by means of a rubber tube attached to the dropping funnel. The nitrogen inlet tube is removed, and a mixture of 60 g. (0.44 mole) of o-hydroxyacetophenone (Note 5) and 125 g. (140 ml., 1.2 moles) of ethyl propionate (Note 3) is placed in the dropping funnel and protected by a soda-lime tube. The ester-ketone mixture is dropped very slowly onto the powdered sodium. After a small amount (2\u20135 ml.) of the mixture has been added, the ice bath is removed and the flask warmed with the hand to make sure that the reaction has started (Note 6). When the reaction has started, the funnel is adjusted so that one-half of the ester-ketone mixture is added over a period of 1.5\u20132 hours. After half of the mixture has been added, the rate of addition is again regulated so that the remainder is added in 30 minutes.\nAfter all the ester-ketone mixture has been added and the reaction has subsided, the ice bath is removed and replaced by a steam bath. The crust on the mixture is broken up and the mixture heated on a steam bath until all the sodium has reacted (30\u201360 minutes). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is poured with stirring onto 300 g. of crushed ice. Ninety-five milliliters of glacial acetic acid in 350 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes. The organic layer which separates is removed by means of a separatory funnel, and the water layer is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the original organic material, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. To the residue are added 150 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, after which it is allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 7).\nThe entire reaction mixture is then subjected to fractional distillation through a Widmer column (Note 8). The material boiling up to 120\u00b0 is removed at atmospheric pressure and discarded. The contents of the flask are cooled and the pressure reduced to 7 mm. The fraction up to 80\u00b0/7 mm. is removed and discarded. The material boiling at 80\u201390\u00b0/7 mm. is collected, and, after the contents of the flask have been cooled, the pressure is reduced to 2 mm. and all the material boiling up to 110\u00b0/2 mm. is collected and combined with the 80\u201390\u00b0/7 mm. fraction. The next fraction, boiling at 110\u2013138\u00b0/2 mm., is collected separately. On refractionation of the lower fraction (b.p. 80\u00b0/7 mm.\u2013110\u00b0/2 mm.) there is obtained 13\u201315 g. of o-hydroxyacetophenone (b.p. 87\u201388\u00b0/7 mm.). To the residue after recovery of the o-hydroxyacetophenone is added the fraction boiling at 110\u2013138\u00b0/2 mm. The pressure is again reduced to 2 mm. and the fraction boiling at 124\u2013126\u00b0/2 mm. collected. This fraction is pure 2-ethylchromone and weighs 42\u201345 g.

(1.50 moles) of acetyl chloride is heated under reflux for 2 hours in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a condenser closed by a calcium chloride tube and supported in an oil bath (85\u201390\u00b0) (Note 1). The yellow reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the liquid portion is decanted into a separatory funnel. The residue in the flask is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of ether, and the ethereal solution is poured over ice. The ether-water mixture is then added to the benzene solution in the separatory funnel, and the mixture is shaken thoroughly (Note 2); the aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The benzene-ether solution is washed once with 500 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and once with 50 ml. of water, and finally is dried over calcium chloride. The ether and most of the benzene are removed by distillation from a water bath, and the remainder of the benzene is driven off at 50\u00b0/50 mm. The ethyl diacetylacetate is then precipitated from the residue as the copper derivative by the addition of 1.2 l. of a saturated aqueous solution of copper acetate (Note 3). After addition of the copper acetate solution, the contents of the flask are shaken vigorously now and then and allowed to stand for an hour to ensure complete precipitation of the copper derivative. The blue copper derivative is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 50-ml. portions of water, and transferred directly to a separatory funnel where it is mixed with 600 ml. of ether.\nFour hundred milliliters of 25% sulfuric acid is added, and the contents of the funnel are shaken continually until the copper derivative has disappeared (5\u201310 minutes). After separation of the ethereal layer, the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over calcium chloride. The ether is removed on the steam bath and the residual ester distilled under diminished pressure. A few drops come over up to 90\u00b0, but the bulk of the material distils at 92\u201398\u00b0/12 mm. Redistillation yields pure ethyl diacetylacetate boiling at 95\u201397\u00b0/12 mm.

The solution is then diluted to approximately 250 ml., yielding a 1.5 N solution of potassium ethyl sebacate.\nThe solution of potassium ethyl sebacate (Note 1) is poured into a 500-ml. tall beaker provided with a cooling coil (Note 2), a thermometer, a stirrer, a platinum sheet anode 45\u201355 sq. cm. in area (Note 3), and two platinum wire cathodes (Note 4). To the solution 10 g. of monoethyl sebacate (Note 5) is added.\nThe electrodes are connected to a suitable source of direct current, 10 amperes of which is allowed to pass through the cell. To the solution there is now added 40 g. more of monoethyl sebacate in portions of 10 g. each over a period of 10 minutes (Note 6). The temperature of the cell is held below 50\u00b0 by running cold water through the cooling coil (Note 7).\nThe run is finished in 60\u201370 minutes. The reaction will have reached completion when a few drops of the electrolyte removed with a pipet show an alkaline reaction to phenolphthalein. The alkalinity should be tested every 10 minutes after the first 45.\nWhen the electrolyte has become alkaline, the oily product floating on the top is removed by means of a pipet (Note 8). The oil is washed with an equal volume of 10% potassium carbonate (Note 9), then with an equal volume of 3.5% hydrochloric acid, and finally twice with half its volume of water (a little ether effectively breaks up any emulsions which may form at this point). It is then crystallized from methanol, filtered by suction, and washed twice while in the funnel with ice-cold methanol (Note 10). The product, snow-white and waxy in appearance, is dried in a desiccator over sulfuric acid. The yield is 16\u201322 g. (40\u201355%) of material melting at 41\u201342\u00b0. These figures for the percentage yields, however, are based only upon the 50 g. of ethyl hydrogen sebacate used in the second part and no account is taken of the 86.5 g. used in preparing the electrolyte solutions. This preparation becomes practicable, therefore, only when several consecutive runs are made (Note 8)."

(0.61 mole) of benzaldehyde (Note 4) in 80 ml. of dry benzene and 20 ml. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. About 10 ml. of this solution is added to the zinc, and the flask is warmed until the reaction starts (Note 5). The mixture is then stirred and the rest of the solution added at such a rate that the reaction mixture refluxes, care being taken that the reaction does not become too vigorous. The addition should take about an hour. The reaction mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes on a water bath after the addition of the solution is complete.\nThe flask is then cooled in an ice bath and the reaction mixture hydrolyzed by the addition of 200 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid with vigorous stirring during the addition. The acid layer is drawn off and the benzene solution extracted twice with 50-ml. portions of 5% sulfuric acid. The benzene solution is washed once with 25 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution, then with 25 ml. of 5% sulfuric acid (Note 6), and finally with two 25-ml. portions of water. The combined acid solutions are extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether and benzene solutions are dried with 5 g. of magnesium sulfate or Drierite. The solution is filtered, the solvent removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure from a steam bath, and the residue fractionated under reduced pressure. The ester is collected at 151\u2013154\u00b0/11\u201312 mm. (128\u2013132\u00b0/5\u20137 mm.). The total yield is 59\u201362 g. (61\u201364%) (Note 7)."

The acid is heated to boiling on a sand bath until the sodium chloride is in solution, and then 1 l. of defibrinated blood (Note 1) is added in a thin stream from the dropping funnel over a period of about 30 minutes. The blood should not touch the sides of the flask. During this time the temperature is kept at 100\u2013105\u00b0, and heating is continued for 10 minutes after all the blood has been added. The flame is then removed and the mixture allowed to cool and stand overnight.\nThe precipitated hemin is removed by centrifuging (Note 2). If the centrifuging is carried out in 100-ml. tubes, each lot of tubes is centrifuged 10 minutes, the supernatant liquid is decanted, more of the mixture added, and the centrifuging repeated. The hemin is allowed to accumulate in the tubes until all the mixture has been centrifuged, after which it is stirred with a glass rod and washed from the several tubes into one with 75 ml. of 50% aqueous acetic acid. After centrifuging and decanting, the hemin is washed successively in the same manner with two 75-ml. portions of distilled water, one 50-ml. portion of 95% ethanol, and one 50-ml. portion of ether. After the ether has been decanted the hemin is transferred to a watch glass by means of a rubber policeman and about 5 ml. of ether. After evaporation to dryness 3.5\u20134.5 g. of crude product is obtained.\nFor recrystallization, 5 g. of the crude hemin is placed in a 100-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, 25 ml. of pyridine is added, and the flask is shaken until the hemin has dissolved. Forty milliliters of chloroform is added, and the flask is stoppered with a cork and shaken for 15 minutes; the cork is carefully removed from time to time to release the pressure. The solution is then filtered with slight suction through a small B\u00fcchner funnel, and the Erlenmeyer flask and filter are washed with 15 ml. of chloroform.\nDuring the shaking 350 ml. of glacial acetic acid is heated to boiling in a 600-ml. beaker under a hood, and 5 ml. of a saturated sodium chloride solution and 4 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added. The flame is extinguished, and the filtered hemin solution poured in a steady stream with stirring into the hot mixture; the suction flask is rinsed with 15 ml. of chloroform. After the mixture has stood for 12 hours, the crystals are filtered with suction on a small B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of 50% aqueous acetic acid, 100 ml. of distilled water, 25 ml. of ethanol, and 25 ml. of ether.

The flask is removed from the freezing mixture, and 255 g. (1 mole) of ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (p. 633) is added and made into an even paste by thorough shaking. After standing for 30 minutes, during which time the temperature rises to 15\u201320\u00b0, the flask is heated gradually on the steam bath with continuous shaking and rotating so that the solution reaches its boiling point in about 15 minutes. The solution becomes red, sulfur dioxide is evolved, and methoxynaphthoquinone begins to separate. The mixture is kept boiling very gently, with continued shaking, for 15 minutes, when the paste of separated material becomes very stiff. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of methanol is added, and the heating and rotating continued for an additional 15\u201320 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled to 20\u201325\u00b0, water and ice are added until the flask is nearly filled, and the methoxynaphthoquinone is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold water until the filtrate is nearly colorless; about 2\u20132.5 l. of water is required (Note 1).\nThe moist material is washed into a solution of 30 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of water, and the mixture is heated rapidly nearly to the boiling point. In about 10 minutes all the ether is hydrolyzed and a deep red solution results (Note 2). The hot solution is filtered by suction from a trace of residue, transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and acidified while still hot by adding 130 ml. of 6 N hydrochloric acid slowly, and with good stirring. The yellow suspension of hydroxynaphthoquinone thus obtained is cooled to 0\u00b0 and allowed to stand for 2 hours (Note 3). The hydroxynaphthoquinone is collected, washed with 2 l. of cold water, dried overnight at room temperature, and finally to constant weight at 60\u201380\u00b0. The yield is 101\u2013112 g.

At the end of this time, the reflux condenser is exchanged for a downward condenser and the ethanol is removed by distillation (Note 2). The residue is treated with 200 ml. of water, shaken, and allowed to stand until the ester layer separates. The ester layer is separated from the aqueous layer and distilled from a 500-ml. two-necked flask fitted with a well-wrapped 18-in. Vigreux column.

To the hot solution, 250 g. (1.16 moles) of diethyl sec-butylmalonate is added in a steady stream with vigorous stirring (Note 3). A tube connected to a vacuum line assists in the removal of ethanol. The mixture is stirred and heated for 5 hours (Note 4), and then the contents of the flask are transferred to a beaker fitted with a stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The cooling is hastened by the addition of 50 g. of ice, and, when the temperature reaches 15\u00b0, technical hydrochloric acid is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20\u00b0. After the addition of about 250 ml. of acid, the monopotassium salt separates, necessitating stirring by hand until solution again occurs. When the solution is acid to Congo red (Note 5) it is transferred to a separatory funnel (Note 6).\nThe sec-butylmalonic acid is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts are dried over calcium chloride overnight. The ether solution is then decanted into a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel. Five milliliters of bromine is added at one time, and the solution is stirred until decolorized (Note 7). Then 50 ml. more bromine is added dropwise at such a rate that the ether refluxes gently.

A stopper is wired in, and the flask is allowed to stand at room temperature for a week (Note 9). The stopper is removed and the mixture heated on a steam cone overnight to remove ammonia. The aqueous solution is concentrated under reduced pressure until bumping becomes violent (about 300 ml.). The mixture is then cooled to 15\u00b0 and the crystals are collected on a filter. The crystals are washed with 40 ml. of ethanol and dried. The filtrate is again concentrated to about 150 ml., and a second crop of crystals is obtained.

            "Three 300-ml. gas-washing cylinders (Note 1) are connected in series, and the second and third cylinders are charged with 150 ml. each of dry acetone. Each of the three cylinders is immersed, in a thermos bottle, in sufficient Dry Ice-acetone cooling mixture to cover half of the cylinder. Ketene gas, prepared by the pyrolysis of acetone (Note 2), is passed through the system (Note 3) until a quantity of 2 moles has been introduced. This process requires 4\u20134.5 hours. During this time, after the ketene has been passing through the system for 1.5 hours, the Dry Ice-acetone cooling mixture is removed from the thermos bottle around the first cylinder. The cold thermos bottle is then replaced around the cylinder. Two hours after the completion of the ketene passage, the cooling mixture is removed from the second thermos bottle, and 6 hours later the third thermos bottle is emptied, both bottles being immediately restored to position. The entire system should be at room temperature 24 hours after the beginning of the run.\nThe liquids from all three cylinders are combined and fractionally distilled (Note 4). Most of the acetone is removed at room temperature under a pressure of 20 mm.; the last small portion is removed under atmospheric pressure. When the distillation temperature reaches 120\u00b0, the system is evacuated to a pressure of 80\u2013100 mm. (Note 5), and the ketene dimer is collected within the boiling range 67\u201369\u00b0/92 mm. The yield of pure product is 42\u201346 g. (50\u201355%) (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

            "In a 3-l. three-necked flask provided with a stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath are placed 402 g. (3.09 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Note 1) and 1.2 1. of glacial acetic acid. To this solution is then added dropwise with stirring a solution of 246 g. (3.55 moles) of sodium nitrite in 400 ml. of water. The rate of addition is controlled so that the temperature does not rise above 12\u00b0. After the sodium nitrite solution has been added, the mixture is stirred an additional 2\u20133 hours. It is then allowed to warm up to room temperature and stand about 12 hours, after which 348 g. (3.48 moles) of acetylacetone is added at one time.\nTo the reaction mixture 450 g. of zinc dust (Note 2) is added in portions of about 10 g. with vigorous stirring. The rate of addition is regulated so that the temperature never rises above 60\u00b0. After the addition is complete (Note 3), the mixture is refluxed for 2\u20133 hours on a hot plate until the unreacted zinc dust collects in balls. The hot solution is then poured through a fine copper sieve, with stirring, into 30 l. of ice water. The crude product which separates is contaminated with zinc (Note 4). On recrystallization from 1.5 l. of 95% ethanol, 360\u2013390 g. of 2,4-dimethyl-3-acetyl-5-carbethoxypyrrole (m.p. 143\u2013144\u00b0) is obtained (55\u201360% based on the ethyl acetoacetate used) (Note 5). A second recrystallization may be necessary to secure a perfectly white product, but the product of the first recrystallization is sufficiently pure for conversion to kryptopyrrole.\nThirty grams of sodium is dissolved in 430 ml. of absolute ethanol, the last protions by heating under reflux. The hot ethanolic solution is poured into an autoclave (Note 6), 75 g. (0.36 mole) of 2,4-dimethyl-3-acetyl-5-carbethoxypyrrole is stirred in, and 36 ml. of hydrazine hydrate (Note 7) is added. The autoclave is then heated and the mixture kept at 165\u2013170\u00b0 for 12 hours. After being cooled, the contents of the autoclave are emptied into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask. The autoclave is rinsed with a small amount of absolute ethanol, and these washings are added to the 2-l. flask. Then 50 ml. of water is added, and the ethanol is distilled from a steam bath, followed by steam distillation of the kryptopyrrole. The ethanolic distillate is collected separately. A glass condenser should be used for the steam distillation, as in some runs a white solid which melts around room temperature begins to appear after about 1 l. has distilled. The condenser water is turned off periodically to allow the solid in the condenser to melt. Steam distillation is continued until the drops of distillate are no longer cloudy, that is, after about 1.7 l. has distilled. A slow stream of nitrogen is passed over the surface of the distillate during the steam distillation (Note 8).\nThe ethanolic distillate is diluted to 2 l. with distilled water and extracted with a 500-ml. and then a 300-ml. portion of ether. The steam distillate is extracted twice with this ether extract, and twice more with 250-ml. portions of fresh ether. The ether extracts are combined and dried with 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The space above the solution is filled with nitrogen. The ether solution is decanted, and the sodium sulfate is washed three times with distilled ether. The ether is then distilled, the temperature of the bath about the flask being raised finally to 130\u00b0. The kryptopyrrole is then fractionated under reduced pressure (Note 9). The yield of water-white product boiling within a 1.5\u00b0 range (85.5\u201387\u00b0/12.5 mm.; 92.5\u201394\u00b0 /18 mm.) is 22\u201325.5 g. (50\u201358%)."

Five hundred grams (4.3 moles) of commercial isocaproic acid is mixed with 250 ml. of benzene in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and the water and benzene are removed by distillation through a short column until the temperature of the vapors reaches 100\u00b0. The temperature rises rapidly as soon as the last of the benzene is removed. The residual acid is cooled to room temperature, 743 g. (4.65 moles, 243 ml.) of dry bromine (Note 1) is added, and the flask is fitted with a long condenser and placed in an oil bath. The top of the condenser is connected to an empty 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask which acts as a safety flask, and this in turn leads to a gas-absorption trap (Note 2). Ten milliliters of phosphorus trichloride is added to the mixture through the top of the condenser, and the flask is heated to 80\u201385\u00b0. The bromination proceeds smoothly at this temperature and is allowed to continue for 8\u201315 hours until the dark red color of bromine disappears from the condenser. When it has, the temperature is raised to 100\u2013105\u00b0 and kept there 2 hours. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask or a flask attached to a Widmer column and distilled. The fraction boiling at 125\u2013131\u00b0/12 mm. is collected. The yield amounts to 530\u2013550 g. (63\u201366%). The low-boiling fraction is mainly isocaproic acid (Note 3).",

A rubber stopper is wired in, and the flask is allowed to stand for a week at room temperature. The crude leucine from four such flasks is collected on a filter and washed with 400 ml. of ethanol. This crop amounts to about 300 g. The ammonia is removed from the filtrate by heating the solution in a 12-l. flask on a steam cone overnight. The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure until vigorous bumping occurs (about 2.5 l.). The mixture is then cooled to about 15\u00b0 and filtered. The precipitate is washed with 250 ml. of cold water and 250 ml. of 95% ethanol. The total yield of crude leucine in the two fractions is 440\u2013460 g.\nThe amino acid is recrystallized by dissolving all the crude material in 12.5 l. of water heated to 95\u00b0 on a steam cone. The hot solution is treated with 20 g. of Norit for 30 minutes and filtered hot. An equal volume of 95% ethanol is added immediately, and the flask is placed in the ice chest overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter and washed with 200 ml. of 95% ethanol. The yield of pure leucine in this fraction is 290\u2013300 g.

            "In a dry 2-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed wire stirrer, a condenser protected by a drying tube, and a dropping funnel, are placed 85.0 g. (3.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings and 150 ml. of dry ether (Note 1). A solution of 199 g. (1 mole) of carefully fractionated bromomesitylene and 218 g. (2 moles) of ethyl bromide (Note 2) in 1 l. of dry ether (Note 1) is placed in the funnel. Stirring is commenced, and about 25 ml. of the ether solution is added; the reaction begins almost at once. The rest of the solution of halides is added during the course of 1.25\u20131.5 hours to the vigorously refluxing mixture; moderate cooling is necessary to permit addition within the specified period. After completion of the addition, refluxing is maintained by external heating for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is then cooled, and the solution of alkyl magnesium bromides is decanted slowly from the excess magnesium onto 600 g. of Dry Ice which is stirred manually in a 4-l. beaker. The Dry Ice should be in the form of small lumps, and the addition must be slow enough to avoid spattering. The flask is rinsed with two 200-ml. portions of dry ether, which are added to the carbonation mixture. When most of the Dry Ice has evaporated, an additional 200-g. portion is added along with 250 ml. of dry ether. The viscous is stirred until it becomes largely granular.\nWhen the bulk of the Dry Ice has evaporated, 800 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid and enough ice to keep the mixture cold are added with stirring. After most of the solid has dissolved, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel with the addition of ordinary ether if the volume of the organic layer is much less than 1 l. After agitation until both layers are clear, the aqueous layer is rejected, and the ethereal layer is washed with three 1-l. portions of cold water to remove hydrochloric acid and most of the propionic acid formed in the carbonation. The product is extracted by shaking first gently and then vigorously with a 540-ml. (600-g.) portion of ice-cold 10% sodium hydroxide solution. After agitation for several minutes the aqueous solution should still be strongly basic as shown by testing with a suitable indicator paper. The aqueous layer is separated and acidified with stirring by the slow addition of 250 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid. The suspension is cooled, and the nearly colorless product, consisting of small granules, is collected and washed well with water. The crude acid, amounting to 141\u2013143 g. (86\u201387%) (Note 3), melting at 152\u2013154\u00b0 (cor.), is satisfactory for most purposes. A purer product may be obtained as large, nearly colorless crystals, m.p. 153.4\u2013154.4\u00b0 (cor.), by crystallization from a solution, saturated at the boiling point, in 45% methanol. The yield of the recrystallized acid is 138\u2013141.5 g. (84\u201386%) (Note 4).",
            "In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a condenser protected by a drying tube, a dropping funnel, and a sealed stirrer, are placed 24.3 g. (1 gram atom) of magnesium turnings, a small crystal of iodine, enough absolute ether to cover the magnesium, and 10 g. (0.05 mole) of bromomesitylene. The bottom of the flask is warmed with the hand or a warm cloth until the reaction begins. The mixture is then stirred gently during the gradual addition of 190 g. (0.95 mole) of bromomesitylene dissolved in 500 g. (700 ml.) of absolute ether. When all the ethereal solution has been added, the reaction mixture is refluxed for about 2 hours, or until all the magnesium has dissolved. A large excess of solid carbon dioxide is now added slowly in small pieces with rapid stirring (Note 1). The resulting tough addition product is decomposed by pouring, with stirring, into a large volume of finely crushed ice to which has been added 100 ml. (1.2 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ether is removed by evaporation, and the resulting oily solid is filtered, dissolved in 200\u2013400 ml. of hot methanol, filtered, and thrown out by dilution with 1 l. of ice water. The crude mesitoic acid melts between 135\u00b0 and 148\u00b0 and weighs 110\u2013120 g. The acid is recrystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0), about 10 ml. of petroleum ether being used per gram of the crude acid. The product, melting at 150\u2013152\u00b0 after one recrystallization, weighs 90\u2013100 g. (55\u201361%) (Note 2).\nA mixture of 90 g. (0.55 mole) of mesitoic acid and 100 g. (63 ml., 0.84 mole) of thionyl chloride in a 500-ml. large-mouthed Claisen flask, with the side arm and adjacent neck closed, and with the other neck fitted with a condenser protected by a drying tube, is refluxed gently until the evolution of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride ceases (Note 3). The excess thionyl chloride is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residual acid chloride is distilled at 143\u2013146\u00b0/60 mm. (Note 4). The yield is 90\u201397 g.

Vol. 2, 387 (1943)] and 50 ml. of dry ether is slowly added with stirring. The colorless addition product separates at once. After standing at room temperature for 2 hours, the mixture is again cooled and then decomposed by adding, with stirring, 500 ml. of water and cracked ice, and then 100 ml. of cold dilute sulfuric acid (Note 1). When the decomposition is complete (Note 2), the ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with a little ether. This ether extract is combined with the ether layer, and the whole is washed with 5% aqueous sodium carbonate solution and then with water. The solution is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate.\nThe ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under diminished pressure. \u03c9-Methoxyacetophenone is a colorless liquid which boils at 118\u2013120\u00b0 /15 mm. or 228\u2013230\u00b0 /760 mm.

            "A mixture of 145 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 400 ml. of water in a 2-l. beaker is cooled to 30\u00b0 in a slush of ice and water, and 350 g. (1.46 moles) of pure, anhydrous 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid (Note 1) is weighed into a separate 2-l. beaker. The beaker is removed from the bath; a 10-g. portion of the 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid is stirred into the solution, and the liquid is then allowed to become entirely motionless. Generally, oxidation starts during this addition; if not, 2 ml. of concentrated nitric acid is poured carefully down the side of the beaker without stirring. Oxidation commences in 1\u20132 minutes and the mixture turns yellow (Note 2).\nThe beaker is replaced in the ice bath, and 20\u201325 g. of 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid is stirred into the mixture by hand. A second portion of 20\u201325 g. is added immediately and stirred. The mixture begins to froth and is covered with a layer of 100 ml. of ether which serves as an efficient subsident (Note 3). The remainder of the 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid is added in 20\u201325 g. portions during the course of 3\u20134 minutes, the mixture being stirred well after each addition. Oxides of nitrogen are freely evolved, and a stiff yellow-orange paste is formed. The temperature is maintained between 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 by vigorous stirring and by controlling the rate of addition of the compound (Note 4). The oxidation is complete within 3\u20134 minutes after the last addition and gas is then no longer evolved. The thick mass is stirred until the temperature has dropped to 5\u201310\u00b0 and then 175 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution (30\u00b0) is added.\nAfter the mixture has been cooled to 0\u00b0, the ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate is collected on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and as much of the mother liquor is removed as possible by pressing the cake with a porcelain spatula or glass stopper. The product is washed with three equal portions of a cold mixture of 150 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution and 100 ml. of water. The wash solution is removed as completely as possible, and the product is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of ethanol, followed by 300 ml. of ether in small portions (Note 5). The ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate is spread out in a thin layer and dried to constant weight at 35\u201340\u00b0. An orange, microcrystalline product of bright appearance is thus obtained. The yield is 350\u2013365 g. (94\u201398%). The ammonium salt is of good quality and is sufficiently pure for many purposes. No satisfactory method has been devised for its further purification, but it can be converted into a pure potassium salt as follows.\nSeventeen hundred milliliters of water containing 0.3 ml. of liquid bromine is heated in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask to 50\u00b0 on a steam bath (Note 6). The flask is removed, 50 g. of ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate is added, and the mixture is shaken for a few minutes until solution is complete. Three grams of Norit is added, and the solution is stirred for 2\u20133 minutes. It is then filtered by suction and the clear orange filtrate is transferred to a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask. Four hundred milliliters of saturated potassium chloride solution (30\u00b0) is added rapidly in one portion, and the flask is allowed to stand undisturbed. Orange crystals of potassium salt begin to separate immediately, and after standing for 30 minutes the contents of the flask are cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath and the potassium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid is washed with 150 ml. of cold, dilute potassium chloride solution (30 ml. of saturated potassium chloride solution added to 120 ml. of water), and then with 150 ml. of ethanol in small portions followed by 300 ml. of ether. The potassium salt is dried to constant weight at 40\u201350\u00b0. The yield is 48\u201350 g. (90\u201392% based on the ammonium salt used). The product consists of orange needles free of colored decomposition products but still containing traces of ammonium salts. An ammonium-free compound is obtained by a second crystallization. Seventeen hundred milliliters of water containing 0.2 ml. of liquid bromine is heated to 60\u00b0 in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask on a steam bath; the flask is removed, and 50 g. of the potassium salt is added. The salt dissolves rapidly; the solution is filtered with suction; and the clear orange filtrate is transferred to a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask. Three hundred milliliters of saturated potassium chloride solution is added rapidly in one portion, and the flask is allowed to stand undisturbed. Orange needles of potassium salt appear in a moment or two, and after standing for 30 minutes the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath. The crystals are collected, washed, and dried as outlined above. The salt thus obtained weighs 45\u201349 g. (90\u201398% based on the potassium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate used). This product compared favorably with the sodium salt prepared by the more elaborate borax process1 with respect to color, colored decomposition products and ammonia content (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

            "A 5-qt. enamel pail or bain-marie jar is fitted with two mechanical stirrers (Note 1) placed off center, a thermometer for reading low temperatures, and a dropping funnel, the lower end of which is placed just over the vortex created by one of the stirrer blades, so that each drop of added liquid is immediately mixed with and diluted by the chilled reaction mixture.\nIn the pail are placed 1 kg. (544 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid and 300 ml. of glacial acetic acid (Note 2), and this mixture is chilled by Dry Ice until the temperature is 0\u00b0 to \u22125\u00b0. Next, 500 g. (585 ml.) of p-cymene (Note 3) is added from the dropping funnel with vigorous stirring, any rise of temperature being prevented by the addition of Dry Ice (Note 4). Concurrently the nitrating mixture is prepared from 369 g. (262 ml.) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 1 kg. (544 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 by the direct addition of small pieces of Dry Ice (Note 4).\nThe hydrocarbon emulsion is then cooled to \u221215\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0 and the nitrating mixture is admitted dropwise from the dropping funnel over a period of about 2 hours, avoiding any temperature rise (Note 4) and (Note 5). Stirring is continued for 10 minutes, after which the entire contents of the pail are poured, with adequate stirring, into a mixture of 1 kg. of cracked ice and 1 l. of water. Separation into layers occurs after about 2 hours, whereupon the lower acid layer is drawn off by siphoning or by means of a large separatory funnel (Note 6) and extracted twice, using 50-ml. portions of petroleum ether or 500-ml. portions of ether (Note 7). The extracts and crude nitrocymene are combined and washed three times with 300-ml. portions of water (Note 8), and the ether layer is dried by 50 g. of calcium chloride. After the ether is filtered and distilled, the residual liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure, using a 1-l. modified Claisen flask with indented neck. Fractions are collected at 15\u201317 mm. as follows: up to 125\u00b0, 25\u201330 g. (Note 9); 125\u2013139\u00b0, 520\u2013550 g. (78\u201382%), nD26 1.5280; tarry residue, 25\u201330 g. The product is mainly 2-nitro-p-cymene but contains about 8% of p-nitrotoluene; it is suitable for reduction1 to 2-amino-p-cymene, from which the p-toluidine is readily removed. Upon refractionation of the mixed nitro compounds, the last half is essentially pure 2-nitro-p-cymene, b.p. 137\u2013139\u00b0/17 mm.; 128\u2013131\u00b0/12 mm.; 108\u00b0/3 mm., nD25 1.5290. The properties of pure 2-nitro-p-cymene are as follows: b.p. 126\u00b0/10 mm.; 142\u00b0/20 mm.; nD20 1.5287."

            "A. Diethyl benzylmalonate. To 2.5 l. of absolute ethanol in a 5-l. three-necked flask set on a steam cone and equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, reflux condenser, and a 500-ml. dropping funnel is added 115 g. (5 gram atoms) of sodium cut in small slices. When all the sodium has reacted, a calcium chloride tube is placed on the condenser and 830 g. (5.18 moles) of diethyl malonate is added through the separatory funnel in a steady stream. This is followed by the dropwise addition of 632 g. (5 moles) of benzyl chloride over a period of 2\u20133 hours. The mixture is refluxed, with stirring, until neutral to moist litmus paper (about 8\u201311 hours). The reflux condenser is then exchanged for a downward condenser, and the ethanol is distilled into another 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser (Note 1). About 3 hours is required to remove the ethanol, and slightly more than 2 l. is recovered.\nThe residue is then treated with no more than 2 l. of water (Note 2) and shaken; if necessary, salt is added to make the ester layer separate sharply from the aqueous layer. The combined ester layers from two such runs are distilled from a 5-l. two-necked flask fitted with a well-wrapped 18-mm. Vigreux column. The fraction distilling at 145\u2013155\u00b0/5 mm. is collected; it amounts to 1265\u20131420 g. (51\u201357%). The residue is chiefly diethyl dibenzylmalonate.",
            "B. \u03b1-Bromo-\u03b2-phenylpropionic acid. Eight hundred and sixty grams of technical potassium hydroxide is dissolved in 850 ml. of water in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and set on a large steam cone. While the solution is still hot, 1 kg. (4 moles) of diethyl benzylmalonate is added from a dropping funnel over a period of 1 hour. The removal of alcohol vapors is facilitated by placing a tube connected to the water pump in the mouth of the flask. Heating and stirring are continued for 3 hours, and more water is added, if necessary, to keep the mass from solidifying. The flask is then cooled and the contents poured into a crock surrounded by an ice bath and equipped with a stirrer. Five hundred grams of ice is added to lower the temperature; when it reaches 20\u00b0, technical hydrochloric acid is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise. The addition is slow at first, but more rapid when the excess alkali has been neutralized. The solid monopotassium salt that separates is returned to solution by adding the acid more rapidly and stirring by hand. When the reaction mixture is acid to Congo red paper, an excess of 150 ml. of acid is added and the contents of the crock are transferred to a 12-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stopper containing a large stopcock which barely pierces the stopper, and a glass tube which reaches to the bottom of the flask. In this way the flask may be used as a large separatory funnel if the stopper is wired in tightly.\nThe benzylmalonic acid is extracted with four 1-l. portions of ether; the ether extracts are combined in a 5-l. flask and allowed to stand over 150 g. of calcium chloride overnight. The ether layer is then decanted into a 5-l. flask equipped with an efficient reflux condenser, mercury-sealed stirrer, and dropping funnel. Two hundred and twenty-five milliliters of dry bromine is dropped in at such a rate that the ether refluxes (Note 3). The time required is about 4 hours. After the complete addition of bromine, 1 l. of water is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that the ether merely refluxes (Note 4).\nThe ether layer of bromobenzylmalonic acid is separated by decantation and the ether removed by distillation. The residue is then decarboxylated by heating to a temperature of 130\u2013135\u00b0 in a 3-l. flask in an oil bath for 5 hours.",
            "C. dl-Phenylalanine. The crude bromo acid is divided into four portions and each portion is added to 2 l. of technical ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is well shaken, a rubber stopper is wired in, and the mixture is allowed to stand for a week. The contents of the four amination flasks (Note 5) are then combined in a 12-l. flask, 20 g. of Norit is added, and the flasks are heated on a steam cone overnight. The ammonia which is evolved is conducted into a gas-absorption trap or merely led into water by a tube from the flask. The solution is filtered while still hot; on cooling most of the phenylalanine precipitates. This is filtered, washed with 250 ml. of methanol, and the filtrate evaporated under the pressure of a water pump until more crystals form. The solution is then cooled and an additional crop of phenylalanine obtained, which is also washed with methanol. The yield of crude product is 500 g., but it is slightly wet; if it is dried overnight in an oven at about 80\u00b0, it will weigh 460 g. This need not be done, however, as the yield of pure product is the same whether or not the crude product is dried.\nThe phenylalanine is recrystallized as follows: the crude product is dissolved in 9 l. of water heated to 95\u00b0 on a steam cone, treated with 15 g. of Norit, and filtered. Three liters of alcohol is added and the solution cooled in the ice chest overnight. The yield of pure product amounts to 367 g. An additional 45 g. may be obtained by evaporating the mother liquor under reduced pressure until crystals separate, adding an amount of alcohol equivalent to one-third the volume of the concentrated mother liquor, and cooling. Additional material may be obtained by continuing to work down all mother liquors. The yield, 412 g., is 62.4% based on the diethyl benzylmalonate. The white crystals decompose at 271\u2013273\u00b0 (uncor.) in a closed capillary (Note 6)."

The solution is heated on a sand bath until it just begins to boil (about 152\u00b0). The flame is then removed and the reaction allowed to complete itself at a temperature not in excess of 159\u00b0 (Note 2). After standing on the sand bath without further heating for 20 minutes, the solution is diluted with a mixture of 250 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 250 ml. of water. The dark red solution is placed in an ice bath and cooled at 5\u00b0. The resulting precipitate is collected on a filter and washed free from zinc salts with 1 l. of dilute (1:3) hydrochloric acid in 200-ml. portions. This orange-red product, after drying, weighs 104\u2013110 g. and melts at 141\u2013143\u00b0. It is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 3), and boils at 180\u2013181\u00b0 at 10 mm.

Then about 200 ml. of mixed acetic acid and acetic anhydride is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 3).\nSixty-five grams (60 ml., 0.64 mole) of acetic anhydride is added to the warm, viscous, light-yellow syrup; the mixture is warmed slightly and is mixed by imparting a swirling motion to the flask until the solution is homogeneous. The flask is then fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper bearing an inlet tube and an exit tube, the former reaching within 5 mm. of the bottom. Dry hydrogen bromide is passed into the mixture, while it is cooled in an ice bath, until the gain in weight is 140\u2013160 g. (Note 4). The flask is then sealed with a rubber stopper and allowed to stand at 5\u00b0 overnight.\nThe hydrogen bromide, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride are then removed from the straw-yellow solution by distillation under reduced pressure; a water bath whose temperature does not exceed 60\u00b0 should be used to heat the mixture (Note 5). During the distillation the solution becomes slightly darker. When no further distillate comes over, or when the residue crystallizes, distillation is stopped, 250\u2013300 ml. of dry isopropyl ether is added (Note 6), and the flask is warmed carefully on a water bath to hasten solution of the product (Note 7). The hot solution is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and is cooled rapidly, with cold water, to about 45\u00b0. The mixture is then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and is finally placed in a refrigerator at 5\u00b0 for 2 or more hours. The acetobromoglucose is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed into a firm cake, and washed with about 50 ml. of dry isopropyl ether. The white crystalline material, after being dried under reduced pressure over calcium (or sodium) hydroxide, weighs 110\u2013120 g. (80\u201387%) (Note 8)."

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled condenser, 50 g. (0.23 mole) of N-phenylanthranilic acid (or 46 g. of acridone) is mixed with 160 ml. (270 g., 1.76 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 1). The mixture is slowly heated (about 15 minutes) to 85\u201390\u00b0 on a water bath. A vigorous reaction sets in, and the flask is removed at once from the hot bath. If the reaction becomes too violent, the flask is immersed in a beaker of cold water for a moment. After 5\u201310 minutes, when the boiling subsides somewhat, the flask is immersed in an oil bath. The temperature of the bath is then raised to 135\u2013140\u00b0, where it is maintained for 2 hours. The excess phosphorus oxychloride is removed by distillation from an oil bath at 140\u2013150\u00b0 under a vacuum of about 50 mm. The residue, after cooling, is poured into a well-stirred mixture of 200 ml. of concentrated ammonia solution, 500 g. of ice, and 200 ml. of chloroform. The flask is rinsed by shaking with a little chloroform-ammonia mixture (about 25\u201330 ml.). When no more undissolved solid remains (about 30 minutes is required), the chloroform layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with an additional 40 ml. of chloroform. The united chloroform extracts are dried over 10 g. of calcium chloride and filtered, and the solvent is removed by distillation. The resultant greenish gray powder is dried at 70\u00b0 for 20 minutes (Note 2) and (Note 3). The yield of crude 9-chloroacridine is 50 g. (practically theoretical), m.p. 117\u2013118\u00b0 (Note 4).\nIn a 1-l. beaker are placed 50 g. (0.23 mole) of crude 9-chloroacridine and 250 g. (2.7 moles) of phenol (Note 5). The mixture is stirred mechanically while it is heated to 70\u00b0 (internal temperature) in an oil bath. Stirring is continued, and 30 g. (0.38 mole) of powdered ammonium carbonate (Note 6) is added as rapidly as the vigorous effervescence permits. The internal temperature is quickly raised to 120\u00b0 and maintained there while the mixture is stirred for 45 minutes. The mixture is cooled to 30\u00b0 and poured into 600 ml. of acetone in a beaker surrounded by ice. After about an hour, precipitation of 9-aminoacridine hydrochloride is complete and the product is filtered and washed free from phenol with 250 ml. of acetone (Note 7). The cake is extracted by boiling it with water three times, using successively 800, 200, and 100 ml., the last portion containing 2 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The hot solutions are filtered to remove the small amount of carbonaceous matter, and the filtrates are combined. Any precipitate is redissolved by heating, and then a solution of 60 g. of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water is added. The mixture is cooled and filtered; the solid is washed with 300 ml. of cold water and dried at 120\u00b0. The yield is 34\u201338 g. (76\u201385% based on phenylanthranilic acid or acridone) of bright yellow powder, m.p. 230\u00b0. This product is pure enough for most purposes, but the crude material may be purified by boiling 38 g. of it with 1.2 l. of acetone. The mixture is filtered by suction, and the filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath. The first crop weighs 26\u201327 g., and concentration of the mother liquor to 500 ml. yields an additional 6\u20137 g. of crystals. Both crops melt at 232\u2013233\u00b0, and the recovery is 32\u201334 g. (84\u201389%) (Note 8)."

(167 ml., 1 mole) of 2-nitro-p-cymene (p. 653), 300 ml. of absolute ethanol, and 3\u20135 g. of Raney nickel (p. 181) is placed in the steel reaction vessel of a high-pressure hydrogenation apparatus.1 The bomb is then closed, and hydrogen is admitted until the pressure, at 25\u00b0, is about 1000 lb. While the bomb is shaken, the temperature is rapidly raised to 80\u201390\u00b0, and then the heater is shut off (Note 1). Owing to the strong exothermic reaction, the temperature continues to rise, reaching about 120\u00b0, while the pressure drops rapidly. The pressure in the reaction vessel is maintained at 700\u20131500 lb., by the introduction of hydrogen from a tank, until the rapid reaction is over (15 minutes). The reaction mixture is kept at 100\u2013120\u00b0 for 30 minutes after there is no further drop in the pressure of hydrogen. After the bomb has cooled, the hydrogen is slowly released and the catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture by centrifuging, or by filtration through a sintered-glass or B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 2). The alcohol and water are removed by distillation, and the product is fractionated in a suitable apparatus (Note 3), (Note 4), (Note 5), (Note 6), (Note 7).\nThe amine distils at 239\u2013240\u00b0/740 mm., 242\u00b0 (cor.)/760 mm., 110\u00b0/10 mm., or 92\u201394\u00b0/2 mm.

This mixture is stirred mechanically and is cooled by a stream of water while a solution of 86.1 g. (1 mole) of diethyl ketone in 160 ml. of methanol (Note 2) is added. The flask is then stoppered (Note 3) and half immersed for 5 hours in a water bath, the temperature of which is kept at 55\u201360\u00b0. The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice bath and poured (with precautions, i.e., under a properly ventilated hood) into 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) contained in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask which is surrounded up to the neck by ice and water. The reaction flask is rinsed with two 25-ml. portions of water. The mixture is now saturated at 0\u20135\u00b0 with hydrogen chloride gas. After standing overnight under a hood, the mixture is refluxed for 2.5 hours (Note 4).\nThe solution is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath. In order to remove as much hydrochloric acid as possible, the temperature of the bath is raised to 100\u00b0 toward the end of the distillation. The residue of amino acid hydrochloride and inorganic salts is suspended in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol. The suspension is boiled on a steam bath for a short time, then cooled to room temperature and filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The residue of inorganic salts is washed with 500 ml. of absolute ethanol. To the combined filtrates is added 400 ml. of ethyl ether (U. S. P. quality) in order to precipitate inorganic material. After several hours the mixture is filtered, and the residue is washed with a 5:2 mixture of absolute ethanol and ether. The filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, about 200 ml. of water is added, and the liquids are removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The nearly dry residue is dissolved in 2 l. of water, and the solution is treated with an excess of freshly prepared lead hydroxide (Note 5). The suspension is diluted with water to a volume of about 3.5 l. and is then concentrated under reduced pressure, at as low a temperature as possible, to a volume of about 2 l. The suspension is then filtered with suction (Note 6), and the residue of lead salts is washed thoroughly with water. The cloudy filtrate, which still contains some free ammonia, is concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure to a volume of about 300\u2013400 ml. The mixture is filtered, the filtrate is saturated with hydrogen sulfide gas, and the precipitate of lead sulfide is removed by filtration with suction (Note 6). The solution is now concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure on a water bath, and 1 l. of 95% ethanol is added to the nearly dry residue of the amino acid. The suspension is boiled under a reflux condenser until nearly all the amino acid is dissolved, and the mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature. The amino acid, which separates in the form of fine needles, is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with a little 95% ethanol. A second crop of crystals is obtained by evaporating the combined filtrates to dryness, dissolving the residue in the minimum amount of hot water, and treating the solution with 95% ethanol.

The autoclave is closed, and then, with continuous stirring or shaking (Note 5), it is gradually heated, so that, at the end of 3 hours, the temperature is 195\u00b0. This temperature is maintained for 36 hours; the pressure is about 400 lb. (Note 6). The autoclave is allowed to cool to room temperature, with continuous stirring or shaking. The cover is removed, the solid is scraped off the walls, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 5-l. flask. The autoclave is rinsed with two 700-ml. portions of water, which are added to the reaction mixture.\nTo the reaction mixture is added 660 g. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), and the suspension is boiled for 30 minutes. It is then filtered, while hot, through a B\u00fcchner funnel. The residual cake is boiled again, for the same length of time, with a mixture of 500 ml. of water and 30 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then filtered as before.\nThe combined filtrates, on cooling, deposit the hydrochloride of the aminonaphthoic acid; this is filtered with suction and is pressed as dry as possible. To obtain a second crop of the hydrochloride, the filtrate is heated to 85\u00b0, 500 g. of salt is added, and the solution is cooled.\nThe combined moist filter cakes are placed in a 5-l. flask with 1.3 l. of water, and, with stirring, sufficient 40% sodium hydroxide solution is added to make the solution just alkaline to Clayton yellow paper (Note 7); about 110 ml. is required. The mixture is heated to 85\u00b0 and is filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble material. The filtrate is then made acid to Congo red by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml. of acid is required). The mixture is stirred for 15 minutes, and then enough 10% sodium acetate solution is added so that Congo red paper is no longer turned blue; the amount needed depends on the acidity; usually about 15 ml. is sufficient.\nThe hot mixture is filtered; the aminonaphthoic acid is washed on the B\u00fcchner funnel with 400 ml. of hot water and is pressed as dry as possible.

            "To a solution of 100 g. (2.0 moles) of 98% sodium cyanide in 400 ml. of water, contained in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer, is added 118 g. (2.2 moles) of ammonium chloride. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under a properly ventilated hood. When the ammonium chloride has dissolved, a solution of 212 g. (2.0 moles) of benzaldehyde in 400 ml. methanol is added in one portion. The reaction begins rapidly, the temperature rising to about 45\u00b0. Stirring is continued for 2 hours. The heterogeneous mixture, after dilution with 1 l. of water, is extracted with 1 l. of benzene, and the aqueous layer is discarded. The benzene layer is washed with three 50-ml. portions of water, and the aminonitrile is extracted, in the form of its hydrochloride, by shaking the benzene solution with 6 N hydrochloric acid, first with one 600-ml. portion and then with two 300-ml. portions.\nThe combined acid extracts are placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and refluxed for 2 hours (Note 1). The hydrolysate is diluted with water to bring its volume to about 2 l. and is then subjected to distillation under reduced pressure (20\u201330 mm.) to remove all benzaldehyde and other volatile substances (Note 2). To remove some resinous matter deposited in the course of the hydrolysis, the mixture is treated with 10 g. of Norit and filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel. The yellow filtrate is transferred to a 3-l. beaker. It is stirred by hand with a thick glass rod while ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added through a dropping funnel until the liquid is faintly alkaline to litmus (Note 3). The mixture becomes quite hot and acquires a strong odor of benzaldehyde. The amino acid separates in the form of yellow crystals. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the crystals are collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. After washing with about 1 l. of water in small portions to remove the ammonium chloride, the solid is washed successively with 150 ml. of ethyl ether, three 50-ml. portions of hot 95% ethanol, and finally with about 500 ml. of water. The crystals, when dried by suction, weigh 220 to 240 g. (Note 4). Drying is completed in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield of crude amino acid is 102\u2013116 g. (34\u201339%).\nFor purification, the product is dissolved in 800 ml. of 1 N sodium hydroxide, 500 ml. of ethanol is added, and the solution is filtered. The filtrate is transferred to a 2-l. beaker and is heated to the boiling point. Then 160 ml. of 5 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added, through a dropping funnel, while stirring by hand. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and is filtered with suction. The product is washed with 100 ml. of ethanol, then with 200 ml. of water, and is dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The nearly white, lustrous platelets have no definite melting point (Note 5). The yield of pure amino acid is 98\u2013112 g. (33\u201337%) (Note 6)."

The solution is cooled and placed in a refrigerator for 10\u201312 hours. The crystalline mass is then broken up with a spatula, and the addition product is filtered and washed with 50 ml. of cold ethanol. The product forms white, feathery crystals melting at 147\u2013149\u00b0 (Note 1). The yield is 116 g. (96% based on the 1,4-naphthoquinone).\nFor the dehydrogenation, 40 g. of the addition product is dissolved in 600 ml. of 5% ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution (Note 2) in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and inlet tube. A current of air is bubbled through the solution for 24 hours; considerable heat is generated, and the initial green color soon changes to yellow. The yellow quinone that has separated is then filtered with suction and is washed, first with 200 ml. of water, then with 100 ml. of ethanol, and finally with 50 ml. of ether. The yield of air-dried product (m.p. 209\u2013210\u00b0) is 36.5\u201337.5 g. (94\u201396%) (Note 3). The over-all yield for both steps is 90% (Note 4)."

The tube is inserted in an electric furnace (Note 3) capable of maintaining a temperature of 420\u2013470\u00b0; the temperature is measured by a thermometer placed alongside the tube in the furnace. The drawn-out end of the tube is connected by a rubber stopper to an efficient Pyrex coil-condenser, which is in turn connected by a rubber stopper to the first of two receivers, arranged in series and connected by a short length of rubber tubing. Each receiver consists of a 500-ml. filter flask, which carries an inlet tube (Note 4) extending somewhat more than halfway to the bottom of the flask. The first receiver is immersed in an ice-salt mixture (Note 5); the second is immersed in a Dry Ice-methanol mixture contained in a Dewar flask. The exit tube of the second receiver is connected to a manometer (Note 6) and to a water pump.\nPinacol (Note 7) or pinacolone is placed in the Claisen flask and is distilled, under the vacuum of a water pump, through the Pyrex tube, which is maintained at a temperature of 420\u2013470\u00b0. About 100 g. of pinacol is distilled in 15 minutes, and then the apparatus is swept out by maintaining the reduced pressure for 15 minutes longer. The water and resinous material collected in the ice-cooled receiver are discarded (Note 8). The second receiver is removed from the cooling bath, and the product is allowed to melt. Two layers are formed; these are allowed to separate, and then the receiver is replaced in the cooling bath until the lower water layer is frozen. The crude dimethylbutadiene is then decanted. The yellow product is dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate and is fractionated (Note 9) through a Widmer or other column; the portion boiling at 67\u201370\u00b0 is collected. The yield from 100 g. of pinacol is 55\u201360 g. (79\u201386%) (Note 10). The diene is best stored over a small amount of hydroquinone in a refrigerator."

            "A solution of 1.65 kg. of crystallized glucose or 1.5 kg. of anhydrous glucose (8.3 moles) is prepared by heating the solid on a steam bath with 1.35 l. of distilled water. The solution is cooled and placed in a 2.5-1. glass-stoppered bottle. Fifteen grams of emulsin (Note 1) is added, then 20 ml. of toluene, and the flask is closed and allowed to stand at room temperature, with occasional shaking, for 5 weeks. The solution is then boiled, diluted with 8.5 l. of water, and filtered. To the filtrate is added 56 g. of baker's yeast in 650 ml. of water, and the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 28\u201332\u00b0 for 12\u201314 days (Note 2). The mixture is then boiled for 30 minutes with an excess of powdered calcium carbonate and filtered.\nThe filtrate is evaporated under a pressure of 20\u201330 mm. to as thick a syrup as possible. For this operation the solution is placed in a 12-l. flask set in a steam bath and connected by a goose-neck to a condenser, which in turn is connected to a suction or distilling flask. A very fine capillary inlet tube into the 12-l. flask prevents any violent ebullition (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nTo the thick syrup (170\u2013185 g.) are added 100 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate and 1.125 l. of acetic anhydride. The mixture is carefully heated to the boiling point with provision for cooling the flask with wet cloths should the acetylation become too violent. When the reaction is complete (about 20 minutes is required) the solution is poured into 10 l. of ice water. The water is decanted and renewed twice at 24-hour intervals in order to render the acetylated sugar filterable.\nThe dark brown product is filtered and, after drying in the air, is extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus. The ether is removed by evaporation, and the light-colored residue (170 g.) is recrystallized from 1.65 l. of hot methanol. The crystals are washed on a B\u00fcchner funnel with methanol until free from colored impurities. The yield is 77\u201387 g. of material which melts at 187\u2013190\u00b0. A second recrystallization from methanol (1.25 ml. per g. of product) gives pure \u03b2octaacetylgentiobiose, with about 10% loss. The pure substance melts at 196\u00b0 (cor.)."

(0.7 mole) of trityl chloride, and 500 ml. of anhydrous pyridine [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 100 (1941)], is heated on the steam cone until solution is complete (Note 1). Without cooling, 360 ml. of acetic anhydride is added in one portion (Note 2). After standing for 12 hours, the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 10 l. of ice water, to which 500 ml. of acetic acid has been added, and the resulting mixture is vigorously stirred mechanically for 2 hours (Note 3). The precipitate is filtered and is immediately stirred for a short time with 10 l. of ice water. The white, granular precipitate is filtered, washed well with cold water, and then air-dried (Note 4). The dried solid is digested with 500 ml. of ether (Note 5). The insoluble portion is dissolved in hot 95% ethanol (approximately 3 l.), and the solution is decolorized and filtered while hot. The filtrate, upon cooling, deposits fine needles of 6-trityl-\u03b2-d-glucose-1,2,3,4-tetraacetate of sufficient purity for further use. The yield at this point is about 169 g. (43%). Recrystallization from 95% ethanol gives the pure compound which melts at 166\u2013166.5\u00b0. In pyridine, [\u03b1]19D is + 44.8\u00b0; [\u03b1]28D, +45.3\u00b0.

            "In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, and 1-l. dropping funnel is placed 200 g. (1.33 moles) of powdered d-tartaric acid (Note 1). To this are added, successively, 432 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 432 ml. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50). The mixture is stirred until the tartaric acid is all, or nearly all, in solution (5\u201310 minutes) (Note 2). Then 800 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is slowly added from the dropping funnel. As soon as the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 38\u00b0, the flask is surrounded by a vessel of ice water, and the rate of addition of acid is regulated so that the temperature is maintained at 38\u201343\u00b0 (Note 3). Near the end of the addition (about 15 minutes), tartaric acid dinitrate sometimes begins to crystallize. After all the sulfuric acid has been added the mixture is allowed to stand in a cool (20\u201325\u00b0) place for 3 hours.\nThe crystalline mass is broken up with a glass rod and collected on a glass filter cloth (Note 4) in an 18-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The resulting cake is pressed nearly dry by means of a large flat glass stopper or the bottom of a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. After most of the mother liquor has been removed (Note 5), the solid is transferred in portions to a 4-l. beaker containing about 3 l. of finely cracked ice The ice is stirred to effect solution of each portion of the solid as it is added; a wooden stirring rod with a flat end is advisable. Not more than 10 minutes should be required.\nThe cold solution is poured immediately into a previously assembled apparatus, consisting of a 5-l. three-necked flask, immersed in a 20-in. tub of ice-salt mixture (Note 6), and provided with a stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer for reading low temperatures. The solution is neutralized by the addition of 600\u2013700 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) at such a rate that the temperature never exceeds \u22125\u00b0(Note 7); the tip of the dropping funnel should be placed directly over the vortex created by the stirrer. After 500 ml. of ammonium hydroxide has been added, the solution is tested with Congo red paper at intervals corresponding to the addition of 50 ml. of ammonium hydroxide; 3\u20134 hours is required for the neutralization. An additional 100 ml. of ammonium hydroxide is then added.\nWhile the neutralization is in progress, a solution of hexamethylenetetramine (Note 8) is prepared by the cautious addition of 520 ml. of formalin (sp. gr. 1.08; approximately 7 moles) to 500 ml. of ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90; approximately 7.5 moles). The temperature must be maintained below 20\u00b0 by external cooling with ice water. The solution is finally chilled to 0\u00b0 and added dropwise to the cold ammoniacal solution of tartaric acid dinitrate; the temperature should not exceed 2\u00b0. The addition requires 30 minutes. Stirring is then discontinued, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. During this period the cooling bath and the reaction mixture come to room temperature.\nThe solution is now filtered, and 100 ml. of ethanol is added to the filtrate, which is then acidified (hood) to Congo red paper by the slow (30 minutes) addition of about 400 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The acidified mixture is cooled in an icebox for 4\u20135 hours, and the imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid is collected on an 18-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid is transferred to a 1-l. beaker, stirred with 400\u2013500 ml. of water, and again filtered. It is washed on the funnel successively with three 150-ml. portions of water, two 75-ml. portions of methanol, and finally with 75 ml. of ether. After drying in the air, it weighs 90\u2013100 g. (43\u201348%) and melts with decomposition at about 280\u00b0.\nThe imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid is divided into two portions. Each portion is intimately mixed with about 0.5 g. of copper-chromium oxide catalyst [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 142 (1943)] or powdered copper oxide (Note 9), and the resulting mixture is transferred to a 250-ml. Claisen flask having a modified side arm; the receiving flask is loosely placed over the side arm. The flask is heated gently with a free flame. After a small fore-run at 95\u2013100\u00b0, the temperature rises sharply to 260\u00b0 (Note 10), and the imidazole distils at 262\u2013264\u00b0. The product is purified by dissolving it in 60\u201370 ml. of benzene, boiling the solution for a few minutes with 2\u20133 g. of decolorizing carbon (Note 11), filtering the mixture through a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel, and cooling the filtrate to 10\u00b0 for 2 hours. The yield is 13\u201314.5 g. (68\u201376%) of a pure white product, m.p. 88\u201390\u00b0 (Note 12)."

            "A. Fatty acids. In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 250 ml. of dynamite-grade glycerin (Note 1) and 40 g. (0.71 mole) of potassium hydroxide. The mixture is heated to 120\u2013140\u00b0 and is shaken by hand until the alkali is dissolved. To the hot solution there is added, in one portion (Note 2), 110 ml. (100 g., 0.11 mole) of sunflower-seed oil (Note 3) and (Note 4) which has been preheated to 110\u2013115\u00b0. The hot solution is swirled vigorously until saponification is complete (Note 5). This is indicated by the formation of a permanent lather. After the mixture has cooled somewhat, 150 ml. of sulfuric acid (25% by volume) is added cautiously (Note 6) while the flask is swirled. Then 200 ml. of hot water is added, and, if necessary, the mixture is heated until the layer of fatty acid is clear. The water layer is removed, the acid layer is washed with two 500-ml. portions of hot water, and then it is filtered with the aid of suction through a large Hirsch funnel which is heated by a steam or hot-water jacket. The acids (90\u201395 g.) (Note 7) are dried thoroughly by heating them rapidly to 130\u00b0, with stirring.",
            "B. Tetrabromostearic acid. In a 4-l. beaker equipped with a mechanical stirrer the above fatty acids are dissolved in 2 l. of petroleum ether (Note 8), and the solution is chilled to 0\u201310\u00b0. After 20\u201325 minutes, the solution deposits about 10 g. of solid saturated fatty acids, which are removed by rapid filtration with gentle suction. The filtrate is transferred to the 4-l. beaker and cooled to 0\u201310\u00b0. Then, with stirring, 30.7 ml. (90 g., 0.56 mole) of bromine (Note 9) is slowly introduced from a dropping funnel (Note 10). The bromine is added at such a rate that the temperature remains between 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0; about 20 minutes is usually required. Tetrabromostearic acid begins to separate toward the end of the addition. The solution, which should contain a slight excess of bromine (reddish color), is allowed to remain in the ice bath for 15\u201320 minutes (Note 11). The precipitate settles rapidly, and a large portion of the liquid is removed by decantation, after which the precipitate is finally collected with suction on a 12.5-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and is washed with 200 ml. of petroleum ether. The solid is then thoroughly stirred with 300 ml. of petroleum ether (Note 12) in a 600-ml. beaker and is filtered as before. The gray-white tetrabromide, after being dried at 50\u00b0, is transferred to a 2-l. beaker and dissolved in 90\u2013100 ml. of hot ethylene dichloride (Note 13). The solution is filtered through filter paper and allowed to crystallize at room temperature. The solid is removed by filtration and is washed on the funnel with 200 ml. of fresh petroleum ether. The tetrabromide is transferred to a glass plate and is worked to a powder (Note 14) with a spatula. The needle-shaped crystals are snow-white, with a silvery sheen, and have a melting point of 114.7\u2013115.2\u00b0. The yield (Note 15) is 35\u201340 g. (32\u201336%) (Note 16). The product should be stored in brown screw-top bottles and kept away from sunlight.",
            "C. Ethyl linoleate. In a 300-ml. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 26\u201330 g. of recrystallized tetrabromostearic acid, 85 ml. of absolute ethanol, and 30 g. of granulated zinc (20 mesh). This mixture is warmed gently until the debromination reaction begins. Since the reaction is exothermic, it is usually necessary to moderate it from time to time by dipping the flask into a basin of cold water. The vigorous reaction subsides in about 5 minutes, after which the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes. In order to esterify the linoleic acid, 10 ml. of a 4 N solution of hydrochloric acid in ethanol (Note 17) is poured into the refluxing mixture through the top of the condenser, and successive 5-ml. portions are then added every 30 minutes for 2 hours. At the end of this time the solution is removed from the unchanged zinc by decantation into another flask. The zinc is washed with 15 ml. of absolute ethanol to complete the transfer of the solution. A 10-ml. portion of 4 N ethanolic hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is refluxed for an hour, with addition of a second 10-ml. portion of ethanolic acid after 30 minutes. The mixture is poured into 300 ml. of hot, saturated brine solution in a 500-ml. separatory funnel, and the crude ester is allowed to settle for 10\u201320 minutes. The brine layer is removed, and the ester is washed (Note 18) at room temperature with 300 ml. of 0.5% sodium carbonate solution. The rather stable emulsion is broken by centrifuging the solution, in 100-ml. tubes, for 5 minutes at 3300 r.p.m. The ester and any remaining emulsion are washed with 80 ml. of warm water, and the emulsion is again broken by centrifuging. Washing is continued (Note 19) until the wash water is neutral to methyl orange. The neutral ester is then transferred to a 50-ml. distilling flask and is distilled under reduced pressure; boiling point, 175\u00b0/2.5 mm., 193\u00b0/6 mm. The product is water-white (Note 20), gives a negative Beilstein test, has an iodine value (Wijs, 30-minute exposure) of 162.3\u2013162.5, an nD48 of 1.4489, and a true specific gravity of 0.8846 at 15.5/4\u00b0. The yield (Note 15) is 12\u201315 g.",
            "D. Linoleic acid. The ester is dissolved in 200 ml. of a 5% ethanolic (Note 21) solution of sodium hydroxide in a 400-ml. beaker and is allowed to saponify overnight at room temperature. The resulting jelly is dissolved in 200 ml. of warm water, and a slow stream of carbon dioxide is introduced, beneath the surface of the liquid, while it is acidified with 50 ml. of dilute sulfuric acid (1:1 by volume). The stream of carbon dioxide is maintained throughout the subsequent operations. The linoleic acid rises to the surface as a clear layer. The water layer is siphoned off; the acid is washed once with hot water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and preserved under carbon dioxide. The yield is 10\u201312 g. of material having a melting point of \u22128\u00b0 to \u22129\u00b0 (Note 22)."

The flask is heated externally during this time so that the volume of the solution remains constant. The mixture is transferred to a 2- or 3-gal. crock, 10 g. of decolorizing charcoal (Norit) is added, and the solution is rapidly stirred while it is neutralized (litmus) by the addition of barium carbonate (Note 1).\nThe mixture is filtered with suction through an asbestos mat supported on a filter paper in a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the barium sulfate is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water. The filtrate and washings are combined, and the clear colorless solution of the sugar is concentrated to about 300 ml. under reduced pressure (water pump) on a water bath whose temperature does not exceed 60\u00b0. The mixture is filtered, and the solid is washed on the filter with a little water. The combined filtrate and washings are then concentrated to a volume of 100 ml. under the conditions described above. The warm, slightly tan-colored syrup is poured into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The transfer is completed by rinsing the distilling flask five times with 40-ml. portions of glacial acetic acid, each portion of the acetic acid being warmed to 50\u00b0 in the bath before it is transferred. The acetic acid solution of the sugar is seeded with crystalline D-mannose (Note 2), and, after standing overnight at room temperature, the solution is placed in a refrigerator for a day or two.\nThe crystalline D-mannose is filtered and washed successively with two 20-ml. portions of cold glacial acetic acid, two 20-ml. portions of cold dry ethanol, and three 30-ml. portions of cold, dry ether (Note 3). After drying in the air for 3 days, the product weighs 112 to 115 g. (60%) (Note 4) and melts at 126.5\u2013127.5\u00b0 (Note 5)."

            "A. 5-(3-Methoxy-4-hydroxybenzal)creatinine (I). In a large Pyrex test tube (51 mm. outside diameter and 200 mm. long) is placed an intimate mixture of 11.3 g. (0.1 mole) of creatinine [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 172 (1941)] and 24 g. (0.16 mole) of vanillin. The tube is placed in an oil bath, which is then heated to 170\u00b0, and the mixture is melted while it is constantly agitated (Note 1). The temperature of the mixture reaches 155\u00b0 in about 10 minutes; reaction then begins, and water is evolved. After 3\u20135 minutes longer, evolution of water ceases, and the mixture solidifies. The tube is heated for 3 minutes more, and then it is removed from the bath and allowed to cool.\nWhen the temperature has fallen to 50\u201360\u00b0, 50 ml. of ethanol is added and the mixture is heated gently by occasional immersion in the warm oil bath. The solid partially disintegrates and forms a suspension. The suspension is filtered, and the solid remaining in the tube is warmed with a second 50-ml. portion of ethanol. This operation is repeated until all the orange-colored condensation product has been transferred to the filter. The material on the filter is then washed with three successive 30-ml. portions of water at 60\u00b0.\nAfter drying, the crude product weighs 24 g. (95%), melts at 261\u2013263\u00b0, and is suitable for use in the next step. A pure product, which melts at 273\u00b0, may be obtained by recrystallizing the crude material from acetic acid.",
            "B. 5-(3-Methoxy-4-hydroxybenzyl)creatinine (II). To a suspension of 24 g. (0.1 mole) of the crude condensation product in 150 ml. of water, contained in a 500-ml. beaker, there is added, with continuous agitation, 180 g. of 3% sodium amalgam (Note 2). The amalgam is added in six portion, at intervals of 5 minutes. The solid dissolves, and the initial orange-red color of the solution slowly fades as the reduction proceeds. With good agitation, decolorization is complete in 45\u201360 minutes, if the starting material is pure. When the crude condensation product is used, the color of the solution fades to a faint, but permanent, yellow tint, which should mark the end point of the reduction.\nThe solution is decanted from the mercury and filtered from suspended impurities. The filtrate is stirred and is acidified with hydrochloric acid to pH 6.6, phenol red being used as the indicator (Note 3). After standing for 2 hours at 0\u00b0, the mixture is filtered and the solid is washed with a little cold water and dried. The product (free base) is microcrystalline, weighs 17.5\u201318 g. (72\u201374%), and usually melts at 167\u2013169\u00b0 (Note 4). After solidification from fusion, the substance melts at 226\u2013228\u00b0. When recrystallized from water, the substance melts at 231\u2013233\u00b0. The crude product may be used for the subsequent hydrolysis.",
            "C. N-Methyl-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)alanine (III). In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 5), 18 g. (0.07 mole) of the crude reduction product is refluxed for 12 hours with a solution of 180 g. of crystalline barium hydroxide in 270 ml. of water. The hot solution is diluted with 1.2 l. of water, and the barium is precipitated by addition of 250\u2013270 ml. of 6 N sulfuric acid (Note 6). The precipitated barium sulfate is separated by centrifuging and washed with two 100-ml. portions of water; the combined water; solutions are evaporated under reduced pressure at 50\u00b0 to a volume of about 50 ml. The acid solution is made alkaline to litmus by addition of about 10 ml. of a 12% solution of ammonium hydroxide in water. After standing for 24 hours at 0\u00b0, the mixture is filtered, and the solid is washed with cold water and dried. The yield is 12 g. (74%) (Note 7). On rapid heating, the solid melts at 273\u2013275\u00b0. When recrystallized from water, the substance melts at 276\u2013278\u00b0. The crude product may be used for the next step.",
            "D. N-Methyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (IV). In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, 12 g. (0.05 mole) of the methoxy compound is boiled gently for 3 hours with 24 g. of red phosphorus and a mixture of 60 ml. of acetic anhydride and 60 ml. of hydriodic acid (sp. gr. 1.7). The phosphorus is then removed by filtration and washed with 25 ml. of 50% acetic acid. The filtrates are combined and, in a current of carbon dioxide, are evaporated to a syrup at 50\u00b0 under 35 mm. pressure. A 60-ml. portion of warm water is then added, and the solution is evaporated as before. The residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of water, and dilute ammonia (10% by volume) is added until the solution does not change Congo red paper to blue (Note 8). The mixture is allowed to stand for 2 hours at 0\u00b0, and then the white crystalline precipitate is filtered. The precipitate is washed on the funnel with a little water containing sulfur dioxide, and is dried by washing with ethanol and ether. The product weighs 9.5 g. (82%). When slowly heated it becomes slightly brown at 230\u00b0 and melts at 282\u2013283\u00b0; when rapidly heated it becomes slightly brown at 255\u2013260\u00b0 and melts at 290\u2013292\u00b0.\nThis material may be purified by boiling 1 g. of it with 50 ml. of water containing sulfur dioxide, filtering the solution, and keeping the filtrate at 0\u00b0 for 24 hours. The purified product (0.74 g.), when slowly heated, becomes slightly brown at 245\u00b0 and melts at 287\u00b0; when rapidly heated it becomes slightly brown at 260\u00b0 and melts at 298\u2013300\u00b0."

            "In a 1-l. Claisen flask is placed a mixture of 64 g. of finely divided sodium amide (Note 1) and 100 g. of acetyl-o-toluidine (Note 2). About 50 ml. of dry ether is added (Note 3), and the apparatus is swept out with dry nitrogen. Then, with a slow current of nitrogen passing through the mixture, the reaction flask (Note 4) is heated in a metal bath (Note 5). The temperature is raised to 240\u2013260\u00b0 over a 30-minute period and is maintained in this range for 10 minutes. A vigorous evolution of gas occurs, the cessation of which indicates that the reaction is complete (Note 6). The metal bath is removed, the flask is allowed to cool, and 50 ml. of 95% ethanol and 250 ml. of warm (about 50\u00b0) water are added, successively, to the reaction mixture. The decomposition of the sodium derivative of 2-methylindole, and of any excess sodium amide, is completed by warming the mixture gently with a Bunsen burner. The cooled reaction mixture is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether (Note 7). The combined ether extracts are filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 125 ml. The solution is then transferred to a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask and distilled. The 2-methylindole distils at 119\u2013126\u00b0 /3\u20134 mm. as a water-white liquid, which rapidly solidifies in the receiver to a white crystalline mass. This product melts at 56\u201357\u00b0. The yield is 70\u201372 g. (80\u201383%) (Note 8).\nThe product may be further purified by dissolving it in 100 ml. of methanol, adding 30 ml. of water, and allowing the solution to stand in the ice chest for 5 hours. The pure white plates (52 g.) melt at 59\u00b0. An additional 10 g. may be recovered by cooling the filtrate after it has been diluted with about 20 ml. of water."

            "In a 500-ml. flask (Note 1), fitted with a mechanical stirrer, are placed 36 ml. of water and 25 g. (0.078 mole) of finely crystalline alloxantin dihydrate (p. 42). The flask and contents are heated on a steam bath to 50\u00b0, and 3.6 ml. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.62) is added in a fine stream while vigorous stirring is maintained and the temperature is not allowed to rise above 60\u00b0 (Note 2). After all the fuming nitric acid has been added, the temperature is brought to 55\u00b0 and the stirrer is stopped. In a few minutes a vigorous reaction begins, and large quantities of oxides of nitrogen are evolved. The stirrer is again started, and, if the reaction becomes too violent, the mixture is cooled somewhat; otherwise, the reaction is allowed to take its course. The reaction is complete when a current of air, introduced into the flask above the mixture, does not produce much color due to formation of nitrogen tetroxide (Note 3). The mixture is then heated to 60\u201365\u00b0 for 10\u201315 minutes, whereupon practically all the solid dissolves. The reaction mixture is poured into a glass (Pyrex) tray and cooled overnight at 0\u00b0 or below. The large triclinic, colorless crystals of alloxan tetrahydrate are broken up, filtered with suction, washed with ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crystals are then added to 25\u201326 ml. of hot water (Note 4), and the mixture is shaken until solution is complete. The solution is filtered immediately, and the filtrate is cooled overnight in a tray at 0\u00b0. The crystals are broken up, filtered, washed with ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. These moist crystals of the tetrahydrate, which weigh 22\u201324 g., are dried to constant weight in a glass tray over concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting product is a fine white powder (Note 5) which weighs 16 g.\nThe mother liquor from the recrystallization is placed in a 250-ml. flask and is concentrated to a volume of 8\u201310 ml. under reduced pressure at not over 30\u201340\u00b0 (Note 6). The concentrate, when cooled overnight at 0\u00b0, deposits a solid which is filtered, recrystallized from its own weight of boiling water, and dried over sulfuric acid. This solid weighs about 2 g. The mother liquors from the two crystallizations are combined with the original mother liquor from the oxidation, and the whole is evaporated to dryness under diminished pressure at not above 30\u201340\u00b0. This solid residue is somewhat yellow and possesses a strong odor of nitric acid. It is kept on a tray for several days until the odor of nitric acid disappears, and then it is dissolved in its own weight (2\u20133 g.) of boiling water, and the solution is cooled for several days below 0\u00b0 (Note 7). The solid is removed, recrystallized from water, and dried over sulfuric acid (Note 8). This crop weighs about 0.5 g. The total yield of alloxan monohydrate is 18\u201319 g. (72\u201376%) (Note 9).",

(1 mole) of barbituric acid and 1250 ml. of water in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient stirrer and a reflux condenser is heated on a steam bath to effect solution (Note 1). When the acid has dissolved, 115 g. (110 ml., 1.08 moles) of benzaldehyde is added while heating and stirring are continued. The solution rapidly fills with the insoluble benzalbarbituric acid. The mixture is heated for 1 hour on the steam bath to complete the reaction, and then is filtered by suction (Note 2). The filter cake is washed with several portions of hot water and dried at 100\u00b0. The yield is 190\u2013205 g. (88\u201395%) of product possessing a very pale yellow color. The substance melts at 254\u2013256\u00b0 and needs no further purification.",
            "B. Alloxan monohydrate. A mixture of 730 ml. of acetic acid, 95 ml. of water, and 162 g. (1.62 moles) of chromium trioxide (Note 3) is placed in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a thermometer; the stirrer is started, and the mixture is warmed to 50\u00b0. To the solution 180 g. (0.83 mole) of benzalbarbituric acid is added in small portions during the course of 30 minutes, a cold water bath being used to maintain the temperature at 50\u201360\u00b0. After all the acid has been added, stirring is continued and the temperature maintained at 50\u201360\u00b0 by a warm water bath for another 30 minutes to complete the reaction. Alloxan monohydrate generally starts to crystallize from the warm solution. The mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0 and filtered. The product is washed on the filter with cold glacial acetic acid until the washings are no longer green, and then is dried by washing with ether. The yield is 105\u2013112 g. (79\u201384%) of yellow crystals which melt at about 254\u00b0 (Note 4) with decomposition and are sufficiently pure for most purposes.\nIn order to obtain practically colorless alloxan monohydrate (Note 5), 25 g. of the yellow crystals is dissolved in 37 ml. of hot water, the solution is boiled with Norit, and the hot solution is filtered into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. About 15\u201320 ml. of water is removed by distillation under reduced pressure on a water bath. The colorless crystalline residue is dissolved in the minimal volume of hot water, the solution is cooled somewhat, and to it is added 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid. After the mixture has been kept cold (5\u201310\u00b0) for 4\u20136 hours, the alloxan monohydrate is filtered. The yield is 20\u201321 g. (80\u201384% recovery) (Note 6) of practically colorless crystals which melt at about 254\u00b0 (Note 7) with decomposition."

(2 gram atoms) of sodium in 800 ml. of absolute ethanol is added through the separatory funnel while the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at 60\u201365\u00b0 (Note 1). During the addition of the first quarter of the ethoxide solution (20 minutes) it is necessary to cool the reaction mixture occasionally in order to maintain the proper temperature, but after this point the remainder of the ethoxide solution is added just rapidly enough to keep the reaction mixture at 60\u201365\u00b0; this part of the addition requires about 30 minutes.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to stand until the temperature drops to 50\u201355\u00b0, after which it is heated on a steam bath until a sample added to water is neutral to phenolphthalein (about 2 hours). Water is added to dissolve the precipitate of sodium bromide, and the ethanol is removed by distillation. The flask is now arranged for steam distillation, and the ethyl 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylate and unchanged malonic ester are removed by steam distillation (Note 2); about 4 l. of distillate is collected. The ester layer in the distillate is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with 1 l. of ether. The extract and the ester layer are combined, and the ether is removed on the steam bath (Note 3).\nThe esters are hydrolyzed by refluxing them for 2 hours with a solution of 112 g. of potassium hydroxide in 200 ml. of ethanol. Most of the ethanol is removed by distillation, and the mixture is then evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The residue is dissolved in the minimum amount of hot water (100 to 125 ml.), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 90\u201395 ml.) is added until the solution is slightly acid (Note 4). After the solution has been boiled for a few minutes to removed carbon dioxide, it is made slightly alkaline with ammonia. To the boiling solution there is added a slight excess of barium chloride. The hot solution is filtered to remove barium malonate, the filtrate is cooled, and to it is added 100 ml. of 12 N hydrochloric acid. The solution is then extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined and dried over calcium chloride, and the ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residual pasty mass (about 38 g.) is pressed on a porous plate to remove adherent oil and then dissolved in 30\u201350 ml. of hot ethyl acetate. The solution, when cooled in an ice-salt bath, deposits the pure dicarboxylic acid. This is filtered; the filtrate, when evaporated, yields a pasty mass of acid which, in turn, is crystallized from ethyl acetate. The yield of pure 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid melting at 156\u2013158\u00b0 is 30\u201334 g. (21\u201323%).",
            "B. Cyclobutanecarboxylic acid. The above dibasic acid is placed in a 75-ml. distilling flask carrying a thermometer and attached to a 75-ml. Claisen flask as a receiver. The receiver is cooled with running water while the flask containing the dibasic acid is heated in a metal or oil bath (bath temperature, 160\u2013170\u00b0) until no more carbon dioxide is evolved. Then the temperature of the bath is raised to 210\u2013220\u00b0, and the material that boils at 189\u2013195\u00b0 is collected. The crude cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (19\u201322 g.) is redistilled from the Claisen flask in which it was collected. The pure acid boils at 191.5\u2013193.5\u00b0/740 mm. (Note 5) and weighs 18\u201321 g. (18\u201321% based on malonic ester). There is a small higher-boiling fraction, which comes over at 193.5\u2013196\u00b0/740 mm."

            "The apparatus shown in Fig. 10 is assembled in a good hood. One liter of liquid ammonia and 0.5 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate are placed in the 2-l. three-necked flask A, which is equipped with a stirrer and a special reflux condenser cooled with Dry Ice. This condenser is attached to a soda-lime tower which is connected to a source of compressed air through the T-tube C. Over a period of about 45 minutes, 92 g. (4 gram atoms) of clean sodium shavings is added to the liquid ammonia, and the mixture is stirred until the blue color disappears (1\u20132 hours).\nFig. 10.\nIn the similarly equipped 5-l. three-necked flask B are placed 1.5 l. of liquid ammonia and 440 g. (4.25 moles) of \u03b3-chlorobutyronitrile [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 156 (1941)]. The flasks are connected by means of the 12-mm. glass tube D reaching to the bottom of the sodamide flask A and extending 1 cm. through the rubber stopper in one neck of flask B. Vigorous stirring is maintained in both flasks while the sodamide suspension is slowly forced over into the reaction flask in small portions (Caution! (Note 1)) by means of air pressure applied through C; the rate of addition is controlled by placing the finger over the by-pass in the T-tube. At first the reaction is violent, and only small amounts of the sodamide solution should be added. The addition is continued at such a rate that the total time required for addition of all the sodamide solution is 1\u20131.5 hours. The sodamide flask is rinsed with 300 ml. of liquid ammonia, and the washings are added to the reaction mixture, after which stirring is continued for 2 hours. During the second hour, addition of Dry Ice to the reflux condenser is discontinued, and the ammonia is permitted to evaporate slowly. At the end of the 2-hour stirring period, the inlet tube is replaced by a dropping funnel and 1 l. of dry ether is slowly added (Note 2). The reaction mixture is quickly filtered through a sintered-glass funnel, and the filter cake is washed with two 200-ml. portions of dry ether (Note 3). The ammonia and ether are removed by distillation on a water bath through a packed column (Note 4). The residue is then distilled through the column under the pressure of a water pump (Note 5). The yield of cyclopropyl cyanide boiling at 69\u201370\u00b0/80 mm. (75\u201376\u00b0/95 mm.) is 149\u2013152 g. (52\u201353% based upon \u03b3-chlorobutyronitrile) (Note 6) and (Note 7). The pressure is then reduced, and the unchanged \u03b3-chlorobutyronitrile is collected at 93\u201396\u00b0/26 mm. It amounts to 52\u201362 g."

            "A rubber tube from an inverted cylinder of liquid ammonia is attached to a glass tube which extends beneath the surface of 325 ml. of 90% ethanol in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Ammonia is passed into the ethanol until the weight increases by 41 g. (2.4 moles). The flask is cooled in ice water occasionally in order to hasten the absorption of the ammonia.\nThe ethanolic ammonia is added to 49 g. (0.16 mole) of di-n-butylaminoethyl bromide hydrobromide [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 92 (1943)] (Note 1) in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is stoppered tightly and allowed to stand for 6 days at room temperature. The solution is then transferred to an evaporating dish and stirred while it is evaporated to a crystalline paste under a hood. The crystalline paste is transferred to a 400-ml. beaker, and to it is added a solution of 16 g. of sodium hydroxide in 18 ml. of water. The solution separates into an upper layer of brown oil and a lower layer which contains a considerable amount of undissolved sodium bromide. About 10 ml. of water is added to dissolve most of the precipitate. The whole is then extracted with three 50-ml. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are placed in a 250-ml. flask over 15 g. of potassium carbonate and set aside to dry overnight.\nThe dried benzene extract is placed in a 250-ml. flask fitted with a 30-cm. fractionating column, and the benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. Fractionation of the residue is carried out under reduced pressure using a 50-ml. Claisen flask with a built-in 12- to 15-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 100\u2013103\u00b0/13 mm. is collected; it weighs 11 to 14.7 g. (41\u201355%) (Note 2)."

(1.02 moles) of mesityl oxide, and a solution of 4.6 moles of potassium hypochlorite in 3 l. of water (Note 1), and the stirrer is started.

            "A 2-l. three-necked flask is mounted on a steam bath and fitted with a reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and an efficient sealed stirrer. In the flask is placed 600 ml. of absolute ethanol, and to this is added gradually 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of clean sodium cut into small pieces. The sodium ethoxide solution is stirred and cooled to room temperature, after which 267 g. (260 ml., 2.05 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Note 1) is added slowly through the separatory funnel. The reflux condenser is then replaced by a short still head, and the ethanol is removed by distillation at approximately room temperature and under the pressure of a water pump. When approximately half the ethanol has been removed, sufficient sodium enolate precipitates so that stirring has to be discontinued. When the residue appears dry (after about 2 hours) the last traces of ethanol are removed by heating for an hour on the steam bath under a pressure of 2 mm. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature under reduced pressure.\nTo the cooled residue of sodium enolate is added 600 g. (570 ml., 4 moles) of ethyl benzoate. The steam bath is replaced by an oil bath, and the temperature of the bath is raised to 140\u2013150\u00b0 and maintained there for 6 hours. Then, over a period of another hour, the temperature of the bath is gradually raised to 180\u00b0 (Note 2). The distillate that is collected during this period of heating amounts to 200\u2013210 g. and consists chiefly of ethyl acetate and ethanol.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled, 250 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is made acid to litmus by addition of a cooled solution of 100 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water. Chipped ice is added if necessary to keep the mixture cool. The upper ester layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 200 ml. of ether. The combined ether and ester layers are shaken with 350 ml. of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution until no more carbon dioxide is evolved, and then the organic layer is washed with 200 ml. of water. The water layer is combined with the sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with 400 ml. of ether. The combined ether and ester layers are dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation on the steam bath, and the excess ethyl benzoate and acetoacetic ester (Note 3) are then removed by distillation under reduced pressure through a 15-cm. fractionating column. Finally, the ethyl benzoylactetate is distilled (Note 3) at 101\u2013106\u00b0 /1 mm. (130\u2013135\u00b0 /3 mm.). The yield of ester boiling over a 5\u00b0 range is 190\u2013210 g.

            "A. Bromoacetic acid. (Note 1). A mixture of 1 l. (17.5 moles, excess) of glacial acetic acid, 200ml. of acetic anhydride, and 1 ml. of pyridine is placed in a 3-l. flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser, the end of which is protected with a drying tube (Note 2); the tip of the dropping funnel should reach below the level of the liquid. Some glass beads are added, and the mixture is heated to boiling. The flame is then removed, approximately 1 ml. of bromine is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed until the liquid becomes colorless (Note 3). Then the remainder of 1124 g. (360 ml., 7.03 moles) of bromine (Note 4) is added as rapidly as it will react (Note 5); during this period (about 2.5 hours), the acid is kept boiling gently by means of a flame. After about half the bromine has been added, the liquid assumes a cherry color which is retained throughout the remainder of the bromination. After all the bromine has been added, the mixture is heated until it becomes colorless.\nThe mixture is allowed to cool, and 75 ml. of water is added slowly to destroy the acetic anhydride. Excess acetic acid and water are now removed on a boiling water bath under a pressure of approximately 35 mm. When the evaporation is complete, the residue will crystallize on cooling; this residue, which is almost pure bromoacetic acid, weighs 845\u2013895 g. (Note 6).",
            "B. Ethyl bromoacetate. For the esterification, an apparatus similar to that used in the preparation of anhydrous oxalic acid [Org. Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 1, 422 (1941)] may be used, but with the outlets from the trap reversed so that the lighter liquid returns to the mixture and the heavier liquid (water) is drawn off at the bottom. A somewhat simpler apparatus may be built using the water trap shown in Fig. 12 (Note 7). The crude bromoacetic acid is placed in a 3-l. flask, together with 610 ml. of ethanol (9.9 moles, excess) and 950 ml. of benzene. About 1.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to hasten the reaction (Note 8), and the mixture is refluxed on a boiling water bath while the water is separated and measured. Approximately 296 ml. of liquid (whose composition is approximately 50% ethanol and water) separates from the benzene; this includes all the water formed in the reaction, together with the excess ethanol. When no more water separates from the benzene, 75 ml. of ethanol is added to the reaction mixture and heating is continued for 30 minutes. If the reaction has been completed, there will not be a second phase in the distillate. The end of the reaction is also indicated when the benzene flowing through the side tube becomes clear and the rate of refluxing decreases considerably. At this point, 150 ml. of benzene is condensed and removed through the trap.\nFig. 12.\nThe mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed once with 1.5 l. of water, once with 1.5 l. of 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally with 1.5 l. of water. It is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and fractionated at atmospheric pressure from an oil bath using a Vigreux column 1 ft. in length (Note 9). The fraction boiling at 154\u2013155\u00b0/759 mm. is collected (Note 10). The yield is approximately 818 g. (65\u201370%)."

The first suction flask is empty; the second contains 100 ml. of paraffin oil, and the inlet tube of this flask extends slightly below the surface of the oil.\nIn the reaction flask is placed 600 ml. of commercial tert-butyl alcohol (Note 1), and the air in the flask is displaced by dry nitrogen gas. Then 29 g. (0.75 gram atom) of metallic potassium is added, in portions, to the alcohol. The mixture is heated on a water bath until all the potassium has dissolved, and then 68 g. (0.5 mole) of o-formotoluide (Note 2) is added and brought into solution. The condenser is set for distillation with a filter flask as the receiver; this flask is protected from the air by connecting it to the trap used in the initial operation. The reaction flask is surrounded by a metal bath, and the excess alcohol is removed by distillation. The residue is heated to 350\u2013360\u00b0 for about 20 minutes (Note 3) and then is allowed to cool in a stream of nitrogen. The residue is decomposed by addition of 300 ml. of water, and the mixture is steam-distilled to remove the indole. The distillate is extracted successively with 300 ml. and 100 ml. of ether, and the combined ether extracts are shaken with cold dilute 5% hydrochloric acid to remove small amounts of o-toluidine. The ether extract is washed with 100 ml. of water, followed by 100 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution, and is dried over 20 g. of sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. Indole distils at 142\u2013144\u00b0/27 mm.

Vigreux column, equipped with a glass insulating jacket and a total-reflux partial take-off still head1 (Note 4), and the tert-butyl alcohol is distilled from an oil bath (about 120\u2013130\u00b0) at the rate of 25 drops per minute with a reflux ratio at the still head of about 6:1.

A 3-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a three-holed rubber stopper through which are passed an inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask, an outlet tube, and a thermometer. The inlet tube is connected to a cylinder of chlorine through a bubble counter consisting of a 500-ml. wash bottle which contains about 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The outlet tube is connected with a gas trap in which the evolved hydrochloric acid is absorbed by running water. It is best to set up the apparatus under a good hood.\nIn the flask are placed 240 g. (2 moles) of acetophenone and 1 l. of glacial acetic acid. The thermometer is adjusted so that it extends considerably below the surface of the solution, and chlorine is admitted at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 60\u00b0 (Note 1). Chlorination is continued until an excess of the halogen has been absorbed. This requires about 5 hours; completion of the reaction is indicated by the development of a yellow color. The reaction mixture is poured over 6 l. of crushed ice in a 2-gal. jar. The mixture is stirred several times (Note 2) and allowed to stand until the ice has melted. The dichloroacetophenone, which separates as a heavy lachrymatory oil, is removed. The yield is 340\u2013370 g. (90\u201397%). This product, containing only a few per cent of water and acetic acid, is pure enough for the preparation of mandelic acid. It may be purified by adding about 100 ml. of benzene, removing the water and benzene by distillation, and fractionally distilling the residual oil under reduced pressure. There is obtained 302\u2013356 g. (80\u201394%) of a colorless oil boiling at 132\u2013134\u00b0/13 mm. (142\u2013144\u00b0/25 mm.).",
            "B. Mandelic acid. In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer, is placed 156 g. (3.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 1.4 l. of water. The solution is warmed to 60\u00b0 (Note 3), vigorous stirring is begun, and 200 g. (1.06 moles) of dichloroacetophenone (either crude or distilled) is added from the dropping funnel. The dichloroacetophenone is added slowly at first so that the temperature does not exceed 65\u00b0. The addition requires about 2 hours (Note 4). Stirring is continued for 1 hour longer while the temperature is maintained at 65\u00b0 by means of a water or steam bath. After addition of 170 ml. of 12 M hydrochloric acid (Note 5), the solution is extracted with ether. The continuous extractor shown in Fig. 18 is very useful for this purpose. About 250\u2013300 ml. of ether is used, and the extraction is continued until no more material is obtained. With this apparatus, about 130 g. of crude mandelic acid is recovered after 24 hours, and 150 g. after 48 hours. The volume of liquid in the larger flask must be great enough so that, when 250\u2013300 ml. of ether is used for the extraction, there will be a continuous overflow from the larger to the smaller flask; the latter serves as the \"boiler.\"\nFig. 18.\nThe ether extracts are transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, the ether is removed by distillation, and the residue of crude mandelic acid is dried by warming it on a steam bath under the vacuum of a water pump. About 400 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is distilled until 100 ml. of distillate is collected. The acid in the residual mixture is brought completely into solution by the addition of 6\u201310 ml. of ethanol. The hot solution is then filtered through a warm B\u00fcchner funnel, and the filtrate is cooled overnight at 6\u00b0. The first crop of pure mandelic acid weighs 100\u2013120 g. A second crop is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquor to about one-fourth its volume; this weighs 20\u201340 g. The total yield is 136\u2013144 g. (85\u201390% based on the dichloroacetophenone, or 76\u201387% based on the acetophenone). The white crystalline product melts at 115\u2013117\u00b0 (Note 6)."

            "A 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1) and a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride tube. A solution of 400 g. (2.56 moles) of l-menthol (crystals, m.p. 41\u201342\u00b0) in 1 l. of dry toluene (Note 2) is placed in the flask, and to it is added 70 g. (3.04 gram atoms) of clean sodium. The third neck of the flask is then tightly closed with a cork stopper, and the flask is heated in an oil bath until the toluene refluxes gently. As soon as the sodium has melted, stirring is begun and is maintained at such a rate that the sodium is broken into fine globules.\nAfter the reaction mixture has been refluxed for 15 hours, the stirrer is stopped, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool, and the excess sodium (Note 3) is carefully removed. The apparatus is then assembled as before (Note 1), but with a 1-l. separatory funnel fitted into the third neck of the flask (Note 4). The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 85\u201390\u00b0, and with continued stirring, a solution of 95 g. (1.01 moles) of monochloroacetic acid (Note 5) in 800 ml. of warm dry toluene is added from the separatory funnel at such a rate that refluxing is not too vigorous. A heavy precipitate of sodium chloroacetate forms immediately. After all the chloroacetic acid has been added, the mixture is refluxed and stirred for 48 hours. During this period, the stirring must be as thorough as possible; it is necessary to add 1\u20131.5 l. of dry toluene, and the stirrer must be stopped at frequent intervals while the solid material is removed from the side of the flask.\nWhen the reaction is complete, the flask is removed from the oil bath and the cooled reaction mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel and extracted with three 1-l. portions of water (Note 6). The water extract is carefully acidified with 20% hydrochloric acid, and the crude menthoxyacetic acid, which collects on top as a brown oil, is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene extracts are combined, and the solvent is removed by distillation on a steam cone. The residue is then fractionally distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling below 100\u00b0/20 mm. is mainly water and toluene. The second fraction boiling at 100\u2013115\u00b0/8\u201310 mm. is impure l-menthol and may be saved for redistillation (Note 6). The yield of l-menthoxyacetic acid, boiling at 134\u2013137\u00b0/2 mm. (150\u2013155\u00b0/4 mm.), [\u03b1]2D \u221292.4\u00b0, amounts to 166\u2013180 g. (78\u201384%)."

(118 ml., 0.85 mole) of mesitylene, 147 g. (1.25 moles) of zinc cyanide (Note 3), and 400 ml. of tetrachloroethane (Note 4). The inlet tube is connected to a source of hydrogen chloride (Note 5), and the mixture is stirred at room temperature while a rapid stream of dry hydrogen chloride is passed through it. This is continued until the zinc cyanide is decomposed; usually about 3 hours is required. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath, the inlet tube is removed, and 293 g. (2.2 moles) of finely ground anhydrous aluminum chloride is added to the mixture (Note 6) and (Note 7), with very vigorous stirring. The ice bath is then removed, and the passage of hydrogen chloride is resumed for the remainder of the reaction period. The heat of reaction is sufficient to warm the mixture slowly, and a temperature of about 70\u00b0 is reached at the end of an hour. A temperature of 67\u201372\u00b0 is maintained for an additional 2.5 hours. The cooled mixture is decomposed by pouring it cautiously, with stirring by hand, into a 4-l. container about half full of crushed ice, to which has been added 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After the mixture has stood overnight, it is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and refluxed for 3 hours. The organic layer is then separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with 50 ml. of tetrachloroethane. The combined tetrachloroethane solutions are washed with 150 ml. of a 10% solution of sodium carbonate and distilled with steam. The first 800\u2013900 ml. of distillate is set aside for recovery of the solvent (Note 8) and (Note 9), and the second portion is collected as long as oily drops are observed (Note 10). This distillate is extracted with 500 ml. of benzene, the solvent is removed on the steam bath, and the residue is distilled from a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask. After a small fore-run, the mesitaldehyde distils at 118\u2013121\u00b0/16 mm. The yield is 95\u2013102 g. (75\u201381%) (Note 11) and (Note 12).",

The top of the condenser is connected by a rubber tube to a 6-mm. glass tube extending to the bottom of a 500-ml.

A buret containing approximately 5 N sodium hydroxide solution (prepared by dissolving 20.5 g. of analytical reagent sodium hydroxide in water and diluting to 100 ml.) is arranged for delivery into this flask, which for safety should be placed at least 2 ft. away from any flame. Commercial electrolytic hydrogen is passed from a cylinder directly into the reaction flask at such a rate that 100\u2013300 bubbles per minute emerge in the Erlenmeyer flask.\nAfter the air in the reaction flask has been displaced by hydrogen, the flask is heated in an oil bath at 140\u2013150\u00b0, the stirrer is started (Note 5), and 1 ml. of alkali is run into the Erlenmeyer flask. The course of the reaction is followed by the rate of hydrogen chloride evolution. The first 5 ml. of alkali should be neutralized in 12\u201315 minutes, and the reaction should be complete in approximately 3 hours. About 92% of the theoretical amount of hydrogen chloride (equivalent to 55 ml. of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution) is recovered. The end of the reaction is evidenced by a rather abrupt cessation of hydrogen chloride evolution, and the reaction is discontinued at this point.\nThe flask is cooled, 1\u20132 g. of Norit added with stirring, and the solution filtered with suction through a hardened filter paper (Note 6). The xylene is removed from the nearly colorless filtrate by flash distillation under diminished pressure. For this purpose, a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask is arranged for vacuum distillation, the usual capillary being replaced by a separatory funnel whose stem extends to the bottom of the flask. The flask is heated in an oil bath at 90\u2013100\u00b0 and the solution added from the funnel as rapidly as possible without causing accumulation of xylene in the distilling flask.

            "A. 2-Bromophthalide. The apparatus shown in Fig. 26 is used for the bromination. Flasks A and B are of 200-ml. capacity. Bromine is introduced by means of a current of carbon dioxide, which passes through mineral oil or sulfuric acid in the bubble counter, then through the bromine in flask B, and finally through the drying tower. The tower is conveniently made from a condenser jacket and is filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. Flask A is surrounded by an oil bath and is equipped with a thermometer, an outlet tube of wide bore connected to a gas-absorption trap, and a gas-inlet tube having an inside diameter of 2 mm. The inlet tube reaches to the bottom of the flask.\nFig. 26.\nIn the reaction flask A is placed 134 g. (1 mole) of phthalide (Note 1). In flask B is placed 160 g. (53.5 ml., 1 mole) of bromine. The oil bath is maintained at 140\u2013155\u00b0, and the stream of carbon dioxide is started when the temperature of the phthalide has reached 140\u00b0. The temperature inside flask A is maintained at 135\u2013150\u00b0 (oil bath 140\u2013155\u00b0) during the course of the reaction (Note 2). Carbon dioxide is introduced at such a rate that no bromine vapor is observed in the outlet tube (5\u20138 bubbles per second). The stream of carbon dioxide is continued for 30 minutes after all the bromine color has disappeared from the train. The reaction is complete in 10\u201313 hours, depending upon the rate at which the bromine has been introduced into the reaction mixture.\nWhile still warm, the reaction mixture is transferred to a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask fitted for distillation under reduced pressure. Any hydrogen bromide remaining in the reaction mixture is removed by heating at 120\u00b0 under the vacuum of a water pump. The product is then distilled under reduced pressure. The fore-run of less than 15 g. is largely phthalide (Note 3). The 2-bromophthalide, which distils at 138\u2013142\u00b0/4 mm. (128\u2013132\u00b0/2 mm.), weighs 175\u2013178 g. (82\u201383% based on the phthalide) (Note 4). It is water-clear and solidifies to a solid which melts at 69\u201373\u00b0.\nThe distilled product is pure enough for use in the subsequent hydrolysis, but it may be purified by recrystallization from 100 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. Upon cooling, 100 g. of pure 2-bromophthalide melting at 75\u00b0 is obtained. An additional 30\u201340 g. of slightly yellow material is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor.",
            "B. Phthalaldehydic acid. The entire distillate is placed in a 500-ml. flask and covered with 230 ml. of water. The flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and is heated on a steam cone. The hydrolysis is complete when the layer of 2-bromophthalide has disappeared (about 30 minutes). The reaction mixture is then placed in a refrigerator overnight, during which time the entire mass solidifies. The product is filtered, washed with two 50-ml. portions of ice water, and dried in the air. The yield of crude product melting at 60\u201365\u00b0 (Note 5) is 140\u2013160 g.\nThe crude product is recrystallized from 400 ml. of hot water and dried in the air. The recrystallized product is white, melts at 95\u201396\u00b0, and weighs 97\u2013102 g. (78\u201383% based on the bromo compound or 65\u201368% based on the phthalide)."

            "A. Purification of citral. In a 4-l. bottle are placed 1 l. of water, 1 kg. of crushed ice, 450 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfite (or an equivalent amount of hydrated sodium sulfite), 320 g. of sodium bicarbonate, and 270 g. (304 ml., 1.78 moles) of commercial citral (Note 1). A tightly fitting stopper is securely wired into place, and the bottle is shaken thoroughly for 5\u20136 hours. The solution, which contains very little unchanged citral, is extracted twice with 300-ml. portions of ether (Note 2).\nA 5-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 1-l. dropping funnel, the mouth of which is connected to a tube passing through the stopper of the flask, and the whole apparatus is rigidly attached to a shaker (Note 3). About one-half of the sulfite solution is placed in the flask and covered with 800 ml. of ether. In the dropping funnel is placed 800 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide. Shaking is begun, and when the contents of the flask are thoroughly mixed, the sodium hydroxide solution is admitted in a thin continuous stream over a period of about 1 hour. After all the sodium hydroxide solution is added, shaking is continued for not longer than 5 minutes, and the mixture is then poured into a large separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is drawn off and the ether layer is set aside. The aqueous layer is returned to the separatory funnel, covered with 300 ml. of ether, and shaken with an additional 200 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide. After separation, the aqueous layer is extracted once with 150 ml. of ether, and the combined ether extracts are then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.\nThe remaining half of the sulfite solution is subjected to the same treatment, and the total ether extract, after drying, is evaporated on a water bath. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 200\u2013215 g. of almost colorless citral which boils at 84\u201385\u00b0/2 mm. (93\u201395\u00b0/5 mm.).",
            "B. Pseudoionone. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer, are placed 203 g. (230 ml., 1.33 moles) of pure citral and 800 g. (110 ml., 13.8 moles) of acetone (C.P., dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate). The mixture is cooled to \u22125\u00b0 (or below) in an ice-salt bath, vigorous stirring is begun, and there is added through the dropping funnel a cold solution of 9.2 g. (0.4 mole) of sodium in 200 ml. of absolute ethanol. The solution of sodium ethoxide is added at the maximum rate which will permit maintenance of the temperature at \u22125\u00b0 or below (rapid dropping). After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 3\u20134 minutes. A solution of 30 g. (0.2 mole) of tartaric acid in 200 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is immediately steam-distilled to remove the excess acetone. A white precipitate may form when the tartaric acid is added, but this disappears during the steam distillation (Note 4). The mixture in the distilling flask is cooled in an ice bath, and the upper layer (about 380 ml.) is then removed and refluxed vigorously for 5\u20136 hours with three times its volume of 25% aqueous sodium bisulfite.\nAfter cooling, the mixture is extracted twice with 200-ml. portions of ether to remove any material that has not reacted with the bisulfite. One-half of the aqueous solution is placed in the shaking extractor together with 650 ml. of ether. The calculated amount of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mole of sodium hydroxide per mole of sodium bisulfite used) is now added as described for purification of the citral. Shaking is continued for 15 minutes after the addition of the alkali is complete (Note 5). The layers are separated (Note 6); the aqueous layer is returned to the separatory funnel and covered with 200 ml. of ether. After 100 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide has been added, the mixture is vigorously shaken, and then the aqueous layer is removed and extracted with another 200-ml. portion of ether. The two ether extractions, one with addition of sodium hydroxide and one without, are repeated. The second half of the bisulfite solution is subjected to the same treatment as the first half, and all the ether extracts are combined (Note 7) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed on the water bath, and the residual yellow-green oil is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 120\u2013130 g.

(1 gram atom) of lithium (in small pieces) (Note 1) are placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser protected from moisture. The stirrer is started, and 10\u201315 ml. of a solution of 79 g. (0.5 mole) of dry bromobenzene in 100 ml. of dry ether is added from the dropping funnel. The reaction usually starts immediately; if not, the flask may be warmed, and the remainder of the mixture is then added at such a rate that the ether refluxes gently. The mixture is stirred until the lithium disappears (Note 2).\nForty-six grams (0.5 mole) of \u03b1-picoline (Note 3) is then added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, during which time the dark red solution of picolyllithium is formed. The flask is then immersed in an ice-salt bath, and when the mixture is thoroughly chilled the nitrogen train is disconnected. Then 20 g. of dry acetaldehyde in 50 ml. of dry ether (Note 4) is slowly dropped into the mixture over a period of 20 minutes. The red color entirely disappears. After 15 minutes, 100 ml. of water is slowly added and then 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.2). The aqueous layer is removed and poured, with stirring, into a warm solution of 300 g. of sodium carbonate decahydrate in 100 ml. of water (Note 5). The crude reaction product separates as an oil and is taken up in 300 ml. of chloroform. The precipitated lithium carbonate is filtered, transferred to a beaker, and stirred with four 200-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are decanted or filtered, and all the chloroform solutions are combined (Note 6). The chloroform is removed by distillation, and the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure through a good column. The 1-(\u03b1-pyridyl)-2-propanol boils sharply at 116\u2013117\u00b0/17 mm. (124\u2013125\u00b0/20 mm.). A small fore-run and a considerable amount of high-boiling residue are discarded. The yield is 30\u201334 g. (44\u201350% based on the \u03b1-picoline) (Note 7) and (Note 8). This product darkens on exposure to light, and it should be preserved in a brown glass bottle."

The bottle is fitted with a rubber stopper bearing a small dropping funnel and a glass tube that leads to one arm of a three-way stopcock. The other arms of the stopcock are connected respectively to a water pump and a source of inert gas (Note 1) in such a way that the ether can be pumped off and the bottle can then be filled with the inert gas. When this has been done, 50.5 g. (0.6 mole) of dihydropyran (p. 276) is introduced through the dropping funnel.\nThe bottle is connected to the hydrogenation apparatus and alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is then admitted to the system until the pressure gauge reads 40 lb. The shaker is started, and the pressure drops to the theoretical value for absorption of 0.6 mole in 15\u201320 minutes; beyond this point shaking causes no further absorption of hydrogen (Note 2). The bottle is removed and the nickel catalyst is allowed to settle. The tetrahydropyran is decanted, but enough is left in the bottle to cover the catalyst (Note 3). The product boils at 85\u201386\u00b0, but it need not be distilled for many purposes. The yield is practically quantitative."

Vol. 1, 226 (1941). Calcium chloride tubes are used to prevent the entrance of moisture through the condenser and the separatory funnel during the addition. In order to dissolve all the magnesium it may be necessary, in some instances, to continue stirring for longer than the prescribed 10 minutes after addition is complete.\nTo the Grignard solution, 75 g. (71.5 ml., 0.5 mole) of ethyl benzoate in 200 ml. of dry benzene (Note 2) is added at such a rate that the mixture refluxes gently. The flask is cooled in a pan of cold water during the addition, which requires about an hour. After the addition is complete, the mixture is refluxed for an hour on a steam bath. The reaction mixture is cooled in cooled an ice-salt bath and then poured slowly, with constant stirring, into a mixture of 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and 50 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The mixture is stirred at intervals until all the solid that separates at the benzene-water interface has dissolved. If necessary, 50 g. of ammonium chloride is added to facilitate the decomposition of the magnesium salt, and additional benzene may be added if the amount present is insufficient to dissolve all the product. When the solids have disappeared, the benzene layer is separated and washed, successively, with 200 ml. of water, 200 ml. of a 5% solution of sodium bicarbonate, and finally with 200 ml. of water. The solvents are removed as completely as possible by distillation on a steam bath, and the remaining solution or solid mass is steam-distilled to remove biphenyl and unchanged bromobenzene. The product is filtered, washed with water, and dried. The crude triphenylcarbinol, which weighs 120\u2013125 g., is recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride (4 ml. of solvent per gram of solid). The weight of the first crop of colorless triphenylcarbinol is 110\u2013115 g. (Note 3). A second crop may be obtained by heating the filtrate with a gram of Norit, then concentrating to about 125 ml. and cooling the solution.

        "Procedure": [
            "A mixture of 250 g. of pure triphenylcarbinol (p. 839) and 80 ml. of dry benzene is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser. The condenser is provided with a calcium chloride tube at the top (Note 1). The mixture is heated on a steam bath; when it is hot, 50 ml. of acetyl chloride (Note 2) is added through the top of the condenser. Heating is continued while the mixture is shaken vigorously. In about 5 minutes all the solid triphenylcarbinol disappears and a clear solution results. In the course of 10 minutes, an additional 100 ml. of acetyl chloride is added in 10-ml. portions. The solution is then refluxed for 30 minutes longer.\nThe solution is cooled by shaking the flask under running water, and during this operation 200 ml. of petroleum ether (Note 3) is added through the top of the condenser; the triphenylchloromethane separates in sugarlike crystals. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath for 1\u20132 hours, and the product is filtered and washed with 100\u2013150 ml. of petroleum ether (Note 4). The colorless solid, after drying in a desiccator over soda-lime and paraffin (Note 5), weighs 212\u2013224 g. (79\u201383%) and melts at 111\u2013112\u00b0 with slight previous softening. An additional 30\u201337 g. of colorless material may be obtained by concentrating the filtrate to a volume of about 75 ml. For this purpose, the petroleum ether and acetyl chloride are distilled at ordinary pressure, and the acetic acid under reduced pressure. The warm solution is treated with 2 g. of Norit, filtered, and again warmed with 2 g. of Norit. The mixture is filtered, 50 ml. of petroleum ether is added to the filtrate, and the solution is then cooled in an ice bath. The crystals of triphenylchloromethane are collected on a filter and washed with 70 ml. of cold petroleum ether. This second crop of material is pure white, like the first crop; the solid melts at 110.5\u2013112\u00b0 with previous softening (Note 6). The total yield is 249\u2013254 g. (93\u201395%).",
            "A mixture of 2 kg. (2.28 l., 25.6 moles) of dry thiophene-free benzene (Note 1) and 800 g. (470 ml., 5.2 moles) of dry sulfur-free carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) is placed in a 5-l. three-necked flask immersed in an ice bath and equipped with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser which is connected to a trap for the absorption of hydrogen chloride. The third neck of the flask is connected to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask by means of short pieces of large-bore (15-mm.) glass and rubber tubing (see Fig. 19, p. 550). In the Erlenmeyer flask is placed 600 g. (4.51 moles) of fresh resublimed aluminum chloride (Note 3). The Erlenmeyer flask is tilted and gently tapped, so that the aluminum chloride is added in small portions to the reaction mixture, and at such a rate that addition is completed in 1.5\u20132 hours. The reaction mixture is not allowed to reflux during the addition of the aluminum chloride. Fifteen minutes after all the aluminum chloride has been added, the ice bath is removed, and the reaction is allowed to proceed without further cooling. When no further heat is evolved, the mixture is refluxed until the evolution of hydrogen chloride subsides (about 2 hours). The mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature.\nA 10-l. copper can (22.5 cm. in diameter and 30 cm. deep) (Note 4) is equipped with a powerful mechanical stirrer and a thermometer and is immersed to a depth of 20 cm. in an ice bath. A mixture of 1 l. of thiophene-free benzene and 2 l. of 6 N hydrochloric acid is placed in the copper vessel. The above reaction mixture is added to the vigorously stirred contents of the copper can at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 25\u00b0 (about 2 hours is required). When the addition is complete, the reaction flask is rinsed with a little ice water, and the rinsings are added to the hydrolysis mixture. Stirring is continued for 10 minutes longer. The benzene layer is decanted, and the aqueous layer is diluted with 1 l. of ice water. The aqueous layer is extracted with 500 ml. of benzene and is discarded. The combined benzene solutions are washed with 250 ml. of ice-cold hydrochloric acid and are dried for 2 hours in a stoppered flask over 250 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride.\nThe dried benzene solution is filtered through glass wool into a 5-l. flask fitted with a cork carrying a delivery tube and a thermometer which reaches within 5 cm. of the bottom of the flask. Several boiling chips are added, and the benzene is removed by distillation, slowly towards the last, until the temperature of the boiling residue reaches 120\u00b0. The residue is transferred to a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask with the aid of 40\u201350 ml. of dry benzene and is cooled to about 40\u00b0. Twenty-five milliliters of acetyl chloride (Note 5) is added, and the mixture is heated nearly to the boiling point. The solution is vigorously shaken while it is cooled rapidly to room temperature; it is then chilled in ice water for 2 hours. The solid triphenylchloromethane is crushed thoroughly with a porcelain spatula and is filtered with suction. The filtrate is set aside, and the crystals are washed with three 300-ml. portions of ligroin (b.p. 70\u201390\u00b0) (Note 6). The solvent is removed from the product by allowing it to stand in a vacuum desiccator over mineral oil or paraffin shavings for 24 hours. The crystals are stirred occasionally, and the desiccator is evacuated to 5\u201310 mm. (Note 7). The light-greenish yellow crystals melt at 111\u2013112\u00b0 and weigh 870\u2013940 g. (69\u201375% based on the aluminum chloride).\nSecond crops of crystals may be obtained by distilling, separately, the filtrate and washings until the temperature reaches 110\u00b0 and 100\u00b0, respectively, and cooling the residues rapidly while they are shaken. The crystals are washed with minimum quantities of ligroin (b.p. 70\u201390\u00b0) and are dried as described for the first crop. The second crop from the filtrate weighs 70\u201380 g. and melts at 111\u2013112\u00b0 with sintering at 108\u00b0; that from the washings weighs 50\u2013135 g. and melts at 110\u2013111\u00b0 with sintering at 107\u00b0. These second crops are darker in color than the first crop, and of the two second crops, that from the washings is the darker greenish yellow. The total yield of product varies from 1060 g. to 1085 g. (84\u201386% based on the aluminum chloride) (Note 8)."

A thermometer and a powerful stirrer are inserted, and 325 g. (1.1 mole) of sodium bichromate dihydrate is added over a period of 2 hours, the temperature being kept at 40\u00b0 (Note 3). Stirring is then continued at room temperature for an additional 8 hours; during this time the reaction mixture becomes quite thick, owing to the separation of the quinone and chromium salts. The suspension is diluted with 1.5 l. of cold water, and the solid is collected on a 10-in. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed free from acid.\nThe solid is next digested on the steam bath for 30 minutes with 500 ml. of a 10% sodium carbonate solution, and is filtered and washed. The solid is then extracted for 30 minutes at 80\u00b0 with 1 l. of 4% sodium bisulfite solution; at the end of this period 15 g. each of Filtercel and Norit are added, and the suspension is filtered. The extraction is repeated, and the combined filtrates are acidified at 80\u00b0 with constant stirring (Note 4), to Congo red paper, with concentrated hydrochloric acid (50\u201360 ml.). The temperature is maintained at 80\u00b0 for 1 hour with constant stirring.

            "In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed, in the order mentioned, 50 g. (1 mole) of 98% sodium cyanide in 100 ml. of water, 58.9 g. (1.1 moles) of ammonium chloride in 140 ml. of lukewarm water (about 35\u00b0), and 134 ml. (2 moles) of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The mixture is shaken while 120 g. (1 mole) of acetophenone in 300 ml. of 95% ethanol is added. The flask is stoppered with a rubber stopper, which is wired in place (Note 1), and is then immersed in a water bath maintained at 60\u00b0. The flask is shaken from time to time, and a homogeneous solution results within 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is heated for 5 hours at 60\u00b0, then well cooled in an ice-water mixture, and poured, with precautions (under a well-ventilated hood), into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask which is immersed up to the neck in an ice-water mixture and which contains 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18\u20131.19). The reaction flask is rinsed with two 25-ml. portions of water, which are added to the hydrochloric acid solution. The solution of the aminonitrile is saturated at 0\u20135\u00b0 with dry hydrogen chloride (Note 2) and is then set aside overnight in the ice-water bath, which is allowed to melt and come to the temperature of the room. The mixture of solid and liquid material is diluted with 1 l. of water and boiled vigorously for 2.5 hours under a reflux condenser in a well-ventilated hood (Note 3). The dark hydrolysate is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the acetophenone and other volatile impurities. The solution is finally transferred to a 10-in. evaporating dish and is stirred occasionally while it is evaporated almost to dryness. Once a heavy deposit of inorganic salts has formed, very little bumping occurs. The solid residue is evaporated on a water bath twice with 100-ml. portions of water in order to remove as much hydrochloric acid as possible. The residue is crushed, and 600 ml. of absolute ethanol is added. The suspension is warmed for a short time on a steam bath; it is shaken thoroughly and then chilled in an ice-water mixture. The inorganic salts are removed by filtration through a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, and the cake is washed with small portions of absolute ethanol until 600 ml. has been used. The combined filtrates and washings are placed in a 3-l. beaker, and pyridine is added while the mixture is stirred by hand with a thick glass rod. The addition of pyridine is continued until the solution is nearly neutral to Congo red paper, and then an additional 50 ml. is added; the total amount of pyridine required is 80\u2013100 ml. (Note 4).\nThe resulting rather stiff paste is chilled in an ice-water mixture for 1 hour. The solid is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 25-ml. portions of absolute ethanol until it is white and until the filtrate becomes colorless (100\u2013200 ml. of ethanol is required). The fluffy material, after it is dried in a vacuum desiccator over flake sodium hydroxide, weighs 66 g. (40%).\nThe amino acid contains a small amount of ammonium chloride, which can be removed by dissolving the product in 21 times its weight of water and precipitating it by the addition of 42 times its weight of absolute ethanol (Note 5). The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in a refrigerator. The amino acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with an ethanol-water mixture containing 80% by weight of ethanol. The amino acid is dried in a vacuum desiccator over flake sodium hydroxide. The recovery is about 70% (Note 6)."

One hundred and twenty grams (2 moles) of 85% hydrazine hydrate is added cautiously to this solution (Note 1) with shaking over a period of 10 minutes. After the reaction has subsided, the solution is refluxed on a steam bath for 18 hours. The bulk of the water and ethanol is now removed by evaporation under reduced pressure until the volume in the flask is about 150 ml. The resulting syrup, crude formhydrazide, is heated under atmospheric pressure for 3 hours, during which time the temperature of the bath is raised from 150\u00b0 to 200\u00b0. After cooling to about 100\u00b0, the oil is taken up in 50 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 5 g. of Norite is added. The filtered solution is then diluted with 75 ml. of ether and placed in an icebox to cool. The crystalline product is filtered, washed with 50 ml. of 1:2 ethanol-ether, and dried. The yield of aminotriazole, melting at 77\u201378\u00b0, is 55\u201360 g. (65\u201371%) (Note 2).

(118 ml., 1.02 moles) of purified benzoyl chloride (Note 3). The flask is shaken to moisten almost all the cuprous cyanide and is placed in an oil bath (Note 4) which has been previously heated to 145\u2013150\u00b0. The temperature of the bath is raised to 220\u2013230\u00b0 and maintained between these limits for 1.5 hours. During the heating the flask is frequently removed from the bath (about every 15 minutes) and the contents are thoroughly mixed by vigorous shaking (Note 5). At the end of the 1.5 hours the flask is connected with an air-cooled condenser set for downward distillation. The temperature of the bath is slowly raised to 305\u2013310\u00b0, and distillation is continued until no more product comes over (Note 6). About 100\u2013112 g. of crude benzoyl cyanide boiling at 207\u2013218\u00b0/745 mm. is obtained.\nThe crude benzoyl cyanide is purified by fractional distillation through a column (Note 7).

This operation should require about 10 minutes. When the temperature starts to drop, the water bath is warmed and the temperature is maintained at about 50\u00b0 for an additional 20 minutes. The solution is then cooled, and the excess chromic acid is destroyed by adding carefully about 30 ml. of methanol, the temperature being kept below 50\u00b0 (Note 1).\nThe reaction mixture is concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure. At first the solvent may be distilled rapidly, but, after the mixture becomes syrupy, the distillation should be carried out below 30\u00b0 until the residue is almost solid. At a pressure of 10 mm. the concentration requires about 2 hours. The residue is diluted with 500 ml. of cold water, which should be added in several portions with thorough shaking to break up all the lumps.

The alkaline solution is immediately acidified with 200 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and the crude 3,12-diacetoxy-nor-cholanic acid (Note 4) is collected on a filter.\nThe crude diacetate is hydrolyzed by dissolving it in 350 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide and refluxing the solution for 2 hours.

About 50 ml. of a 500-ml. portion (approximately 6 moles) of pure concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is stirred until a clear solution results (Note 1). The remainder of the 500 ml. of hydrochloric acid is then added. If the internal temperature does not rise to 45\u00b0, the stirred solution should be warmed gently with a free flame until this temperature is reached. At this point 65 g.

After 5 minutes the solution fills with a white precipitate which increases rapidly in amount and becomes delicately colored. When the temperature has reached 60\u00b0, about 10 minutes after adding the peroxide (Note 3), any further rise is preferably prevented by judicious cooling (Note 4). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 15 minutes more at 60\u00b0, and then an ice bath is raised about the flask while stirring is continued. When the temperature has fallen to 25\u201330\u00b0, the mixture is filtered at once. The yield of 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide is 45\u201350 g. (65\u201371%), and the crude dusky pink product melts over a range of 1\u20132\u00b0 in the region 200\u2013205\u00b0 (Note 5).",
            "B. 2,6-Dichloroaniline. The crude 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide is added to 200\u2013250 ml. (5 ml./g.) of 70% sulfuric acid (50 ml. of concentrated acid diluted with 31 ml. of water) in a 500-ml. flask, and the mixture is boiled gently for 2 hours; heat is supplied by an oil bath kept at 165\u2013195\u00b0 (Note 6). The dark mixture is then poured into 1 l. of water in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, whereupon partial separation of a suspension of black oil occurs. The flask is attached to a condenser by a gooseneck of glass tubing; the tubing entering the flask is bent at a slight angle and cut so that its opening is at right angles to the level of the solution (Note 7). The product is steam-distilled by boiling the mixture with a free flame; the collecting vessel should be immersed in an ice bath. The solid product is separated from the distillate and dried in the air (Note 8); the white 2,6-dichloroaniline weighs 23.5\u201326 g. (75\u201380% based on 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide or 50\u201355% based on sulfanilamide) and melts at 39\u201340\u00b0. If the product is colored it can be purified by a second steam distillation; recovery is over 90%.",
            "C. 3,5-Dibromosulfanilamide. The bromination of sulfanilamide is carried out in much the same way as the chlorination. The stirrer must be more efficient (Note 9); a glass stirrer with two sets of blades is satisfactory if run at high speed. Fifty grams (0.29 mole) of sulfanilamide is dissolved in a mixture of 850 ml. of water (Note 9) and 100 ml. (0.68 mole) of 40% hydrobromic acid (Note 10). The solution is heated as above, but to 70\u201375\u00b0, and 65 g. (59 ml., 0.58 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added (Note 2) and (Note 11). A precipitate settles in 2\u20133 minutes, and the solution becomes yellow. The heat of reaction causes the internal temperature to rise without further application of heat to a maximum of 85\u201390\u00b0 after 10 minutes; by the end of the reaction time the temperature will have fallen to about 70\u00b0 (Note 12). After a total reaction time of 30 minutes (Note 13), during which the mixture has become almost solid and is very difficult to stir, the material is filtered hot (Note 14). The yield of 3,5-dibromosulfanilamide is 85\u201390 g. (90\u201394%), and the crude tan product (Note 15) melts over a range of 1\u20132\u00b0 in the region 230\u2013237\u00b0 (Note 16).",
            "D. 2,6-Dibromoaniline. In a 2-l. flask, equipped with a two-holed stopper carrying an exit tube to a condenser and an entrance tube for steam, 50 g. of crude 3,5-dibromosulfanilamide (Note 17) and (Note 18) and 250 ml. (5 ml./g.) of 70% sulfuric acid are heated in an oil bath; when the temperature of the bath reaches 175\u2013180\u00b0, steam is passed rapidly through the mixture (Note 19). The hydrolysis is continued in this way for 2 hours; small amounts of the dibromoaniline distil (Note 20). The bath is then allowed to cool to 105\u2013110\u00b0. At this temperature the main mass of the product is steam-distilled. The slightly colored 2,6-dibromoaniline melts at 84\u201386\u00b0 and weighs 25\u201330 g. (66\u201379% based on 3,5-dibromosulfanilamide) (Note 21). It may be purified by recrystallization from 70% alcohol (7 ml./g.); after recrystallization the product is obtained as long colorless needles which melt at 87\u201388\u00b0. The recovery is 85\u201390%."

A stopper in the third neck of the flask carries a glass tube that reaches to the bottom of the flask, enters the top of a 1-l. separatory funnel, and extends down to the stopcock.\nA solution of 140 g. (1 mole) of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride and 3 g. of sodium acetate in 150 ml. of water is added to the flask and cooled to 2\u00b0 by means of an ice-salt bath. A cold solution of 80 g. (1.15 moles) of sodium nitrite in 100 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the temperature has fallen to 0\u00b0. The temperature is maintained below 2\u00b0, and stirring is continued throughout all the following operations. To the cold mixture are added 80 ml. of cold, ethanol-free ethyl ether (Note 1) and 3 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid. After 5 minutes, the reaction mixture is blown over into the 1-l. separatory funnel by application of air pressure. The lower aqueous layer is quickly sucked back into the reaction flask. The ether layer is removed and immediately washed with 50 ml. of cold 10% sodium carbonate solution. This ether solution should be neutral to moist litmus paper; if not, the washing with sodium carbonate is repeated. The ether solution is finally dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate.\nA second portion of 80 ml. of ethanol-free ether is then added to the reaction mixture with stirring, followed by 15 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid over a period of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes' contact (Note 2), the ether layer is removed as before, washed immediately with 50 ml. of fresh 10% sodium carbonate solution, and dried over 10 g. of sodium sulfate. This procedure is repeated (about 6 or 7 times) until the ether layer is no longer yellow.\nThe combined ether solutions are then subjected to distillation at 20\u00b0or below under the vacuum obtainable from a water pump until all the ether is removed. Prolonged distillation results in decomposition of the diazo ester and in a decreased yield. The yellow residual oil is practically pure ethyl diazoacetate and is satisfactory for most synthetic purposes (Note 3). The yield is about 98 g. (85%) (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

The flask is then arranged for steam distillation and heated with a free flame while steam is passed into the reaction mixture until about 200 ml. of distillate is collected (Note 5). While hot, the mixture is placed in a large separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer removed; the nitrobenzene layer is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 6) and (Note 7).\nThe nitrobenzene is then removed by vacuum distillation using a 2-l. Claisen flask, and the residue in the flask is distilled under diminished pressure; the fraction boiling at 180\u2013195\u00b0/15 mm. is collected (Note 8) and (Note 9). The red-yellow oil, which solidifies on cooling, amounts to 128\u2013176 g. (40\u201355%) and is sufficiently pure for some purposes (Note 10). A nearly white product can be obtained by dissolving the crude product in ether, shaking the ether solution with portions of 5% sodium hydroxide solution until no color appears in the aqueous layer, evaporating the ether, and recrystallizing the residue from a mixture of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201390\u00b0, Skellysolve B) and benzene (Note 11). The recrystallized product melts at 83\u201384\u00b0; the recovery is 80\u201385%."

(6.25 moles) of glacial acetic acid is refluxed for 8\u201310 hours in a 2-l. flask heated by an oil bath, the temperature of which is maintained at 160\u2013170\u00b0 (Note 1). After this time the bath is allowed to cool to about 125\u00b0, and the acetic acid is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Care must be taken not to reduce the pressure too rapidly in the early stages of the distillation. As the distillation slows down, the pressure is further reduced until it reaches 50 mm. or lower, and the temperature is slowly raised to 160\u00b0. From 2.5 to 3 hours is required for the complete removal of the acetic acid. About 500 ml. of water is added, and the hard cake is broken up with a stirring rod (Note 2).\nThe entire contents of the flask are then transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker and stirred with a mechanical stirrer for about 30 minutes or long enough to break up all the lumps. The finely divided material is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 200 ml. of cold water. The above process of washing, stirring, and filtering is repeated twice. The product is then transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of methanol is added and heated to boiling in order to effect solution. The hot solution is filtered through a heated B\u00fcchner funnel and allowed to cool slowly. When the solution has cooled to 20\u00b0, the product is collected on a filter and air-dried. This first crop consists of yellow needles which melt at 74\u201377\u00b0 and weigh 215\u2013225 g. The filtrate is evaporated to 100 ml. and cooled. An additional 25\u201330 g. of solid separates. Both crops are again washed with cold water and recrystallized from 500 ml. of hot methanol. The first crop from this second crystallization weighs 210\u2013218 g. and melts at 77\u201378\u00b0. Evaporation of the filtrate to 100 ml. and cooling yield an additional 15\u201318 g. of acetate which is purified by recrystallization from methanol; about 12 to 15 g. of product is obtained. The combined yield of pale yellow crystals which melt at 77\u201378\u00b0 amounts to 222\u2013233 g. (78\u201382%)."

An absorption train,1 with the addition in J of a safety tube which extends nearly to the bottom, is connected to the upper end of the reflux condenser (Note 2). A 2-cm. layer of water in J allows it to serve as a bubble counter; K is one-third filled with a 50% potassium hydroxide solution. The entire apparatus is set up in subdued light in a hood and swept with dry hydrogen (Note 3) and (Note 4). Phenylmagnesium bromide is prepared in the flask by the usual procedure2 from 78.5 g. (0.5 mole) of bromobenzene, 12 g. (0.5 gram atom) of magnesium, and 500 ml. of dry ether. The dropping funnel is then replaced by an addition flask (p. 550) which contains 38 g. (0.48 gram atom) of dry powdered black selenium (Note 5). The solution is warmed sufficiently to bring about gentle refluxing, and the selenium is then added gradually over a period of 30 minutes at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing without heating. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes (Note 6).\nThe contents of the flask are then poured upon 600 g. of cracked ice, and, with hand stirring, 75 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added. The cold mixture is now filtered through glass wool in an ordinary funnel into a 2-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted once with 250 ml. of ether (Note 7). The combined extract and main product are dried over 30 g. of calcium chloride, the ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled using a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask. The selenophenol is collected at 57\u201359\u00b0/8 mm. or 84\u201386\u00b0/25 mm.; the yield is 43\u201354 g. (57\u201371%) (Note 6) and (Note 9) through (Note 14). The product should be sealed at once in a glass vial (Note 8)."

Further purification is accomplished by the following procedure: In a 250-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, a small dropping funnel, and a thermometer for reading low temperatures, 24 g. of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 80 ml. of water. While the temperature of of the solution is maintained at 8\u201315\u00b0 by external cooling, 45 g. (40.5 ml.) of the impure vinylacetic acid is added; this operation requires 25 minutes. This solution is transferred to a 600-ml. conical separatory funnel and extracted with 50 ml. of chloroform (Note 6) and (Note 7). The alkaline solution is immediately transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and 300 ml. of dilute sulfuric acid (Note 8) and (Note 9) is added with stirring.

The rate of shaking and the valve on the chlorine cylinder are so regulated that the pressure as indicated on the manometer is maintained between 100 and 150 mm. (Note 5). The addition of the chlorine is continued until the white fumes of the hydrochloride, which form when chlorine comes in contact with the amine vapor, disappear, and the non-aqueous layer takes on a greenish yellow color, due to a slight excess of chlorine. This indicates that chlorination is complete (Note 6).\nFig. 7.\nThe ligroin solution of the chloramine is separated from the aqueous layer in a chilled, short-stemmed 1-l. separatory funnel and washed successively with 50 ml. of ice-cold 3 N sodium hydroxide (Note 7), 50 ml. of ice water, and 50 ml. of cold 2 N sulfuric acid. The ligroin solution becomes nearly colorless. The chloramine is extracted from the solution with sulfuric acid in the following manner. An ice-cold mixture of 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) and 80 ml. of water is allowed to stand in contact with the ligroin solution for 10 minutes without shaking, then for 20 minutes with occasional shaking; the mixture is kept cool by immersion in an ice bath. After separation from the acid layer, the ligroin is extracted with two 60-ml. portions of cold concentrated sulfuric acid. The combined sulfuric acid extracts are used for ring closure (Note 8). The ligroin, which contains not more than a trace of chloramine, is discarded.\nA 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, fitted with a propeller-type stirrer and a thermometer, is set in an oil bath. A mixture of 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 10 ml. of water is placed in the flask, the oil bath is heated to 120\u00b0, and the cold sulfuric acid solution of the chloramine is allowed to flow into the heated acid from the short-stemmed separatory funnel (Note 9). The addition, which requires 30\u201340 minutes (Note 10), is carried out at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture in the flask is dropped from 120\u00b0 rapidly to 95\u00b0 by the addition of the cold chloramine solution, and thereafter at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 90\u2013100\u00b0, preferably at 95\u00b0. The reaction is exothermic, and the rise in temperature is controlled by the addition of the cold chloramine solution. To avoid an undue rise in temperature after the last addition of the chloramine, the oil bath is removed, and the flask and contents are allowed to come to room temperature.\nA 5-l. flask is fitted with a separatory funnel and arranged for steam distillation (p. 64). Two liters of crushed ice is placed in the flask, and the sulfuric acid solution, cooled to 0\u00b0, is slowly added. The amines are then liberated (Note 11) by adding cold concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (650 g. in 1.5 l. of water) through the separatory funnel. The amines are steam-distilled and collected in a solution of 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 200 ml. of water (Note 12). Distillation is continued until all amine has passed over, as indicated by a negative test with litmus paper. About 2 l. of distillate is usually required.\nThe amine hydrochloride solution is evaporated nearly to dryness on a steam bath (Note 13) and transferred with about 300 ml. of water to a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer,2 separatory funnel, and condenser. The stirrer is started, and the acid solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 by immersing the flask in an ice bath. The amines are liberated by adding slowly 100 g. of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 250 ml. of water.\nHinsberg separation. To this solution, which should be cold (5\u20138\u00b0), is now added 23 g. of benzenesulfonyl chloride,3 and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. The separatory funnel is replaced by a stopper bearing a thermometer, and the contents of the flask are warmed to 40\u00b0 and stirred until the odor of the acid chloride is no longer noticeable. This usually requires about 30 minutes. The 1-n-butylpyrrolidine is separated (Note 14) from the non-volatile di-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide by steam distillation, the amine being collected in dilute acid (Note 12) as before. The acid solution is then evaporated to dryness, and the amine is liberated by adding 20% sodium hydroxide solution until the aqueous layer turns red litmus blue. The amine is extracted by one 200-ml. portion of ether, and the ethereal solution is dried over 15\u201320 pellets of potassium hydroxide. After the ether has been distilled from the decanted solution, the residue is distilled from an oil bath. The yield of 1-n-butylpyrrolidine boiling at 154\u2013155\u00b0/758 mm. is 44\u201351 g. (70\u201380%); nD27 1.437 (Note 15)."

The apparatus is dried in an oven and assembled rapidly to exclude moisture; it is advisable to set up the apparatus in a hood to vent ammonia that may escape by accident. The flask is cooled in a Dry Ice-trichloroethylene bath, and 200 ml. of anhydrous (refrigeration grade) ammonia is introduced through the inlet tube from an ammonia cylinder which is either inverted or equipped with a siphon tube. Just before the apparatus is assembled, 8.1 g. (0.35 gram atom) of sodium is cut, weighed, and kept under kerosene in a small beaker. The Dry Ice bath is removed, the inlet tube is replaced by a rubber stopper, and a crystal of hydrated ferric nitrate (about 0.2 g.) is added. A small (about 5-mm.) cube of the sodium is cut, blotted rapidly with filter paper, and added quickly to the liquid ammonia. The solution is stirred until the blue color disappears, after which the remainder of the sodium is added in narrow, thin strips about as rapidly as it can be cut and blotted, while the solution is stirred vigorously (Note 1). After the solution has turned from blue to gray, the flask is swirled by hand until the blue flecks of sodium that have spattered onto the upper part of the flask are washed into the solution.\nThe flask is again cooled in the Dry Ice bath, and 41 g. (0.35 mole) of benzyl cyanide (Note 2) is added during about 10 minutes through a dry dropping funnel. The Dry Ice bath is removed, and the clear solution is stirred for about 15 minutes, after which 200 ml. of dry sulfur-free toluene (Note 3) and 25 ml. of anhydrous ether are added dropwise through the funnel while the ammonia evaporates. The solution is allowed to stand or is warmed in a water bath until it comes to room temperature; the ammonia may be vaporized at any rate that does not cause gas to escape through the mercury seal on the stirrer. The remainder of the ammonia is removed by turning off the water in the reflux condenser, warming the flask in a hot water bath, and distilling most of the ether (and ammonia) through the reflux condenser.\nA fresh drying tube is attached to the reflux condenser, the cooling water is turned on, and to the warm solution is added 65.2 g. (0.4 mole) of bromocyclohexane (Note 4) during approximately 20 minutes. The reaction is vigorous and may require cooling. Refluxing is continued by heating the mixture in an oil bath for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled and washed with 300 ml. of water. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined benzene and toluene solutions are washed with two 50-ml. portions of water and distilled from a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask under reduced pressure.

(2.1 moles) of 30% aqueous methylamine (Note 1). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the solution has dropped to 5\u00b0, 196 g. (2 moles) of mesityl oxide is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains below 20\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3). After the mesityl oxide has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand without cooling for 30 minutes.\nThe solution is then cooled to 10\u00b0 by means of the ice bath, and 125 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains below 15\u00b0; then an additional 75 ml. of the acid is added rapidly.\nThe ice bath is removed, and 300 ml. of 8 N sodium nitrite (Note 4) is added in 20\u201330 minutes to the stirred solution, which is kept at 25\u201335\u00b0 by intermittent cooling with the ice bath. Stirring is then discontinued, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 6 hours or longer (Note 5).\nThe oily layer is separated from the aqueous layer, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts and oil are dried over calcium chloride. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is distilled on a water bath; finally, all low-boiling material is removed from the mixture on a boiling water bath under the lowest pressure obtainable with a water pump (Note 6). The nitrosoaminoketone which remains in the flask is sufficiently pure for the preparation of diazomethane (Note 7). The yield is 221\u2013257 g. (70\u201380% based on mesityl oxide).\nIf a purer product is desired for other purposes, the nitrosoaminoketone is distilled at low pressure (see Caution). The substance boils at 119\u00b0/5 mm., at 111\u00b0/3 mm., or at 101\u00b0/1.5 mm.",
            "B. Diazomethane. Sodium isopropoxide method (Note 9).\nCaution! Diazomethane is very toxic; its preparation should be carried out only in a well-ventilated hood. Individuals differ in their susceptibility; some develop symptoms similar to asthma from very small concentrations, whereas others notice no ill effects from much larger quantities. The use of a safety screen is also recommended.\nThirty milliliters of a solution of sodium isopropoxide, prepared from 1 g. of sodium and 100 ml. of isopropyl alcohol, is placed in a 250-ml. Claisen flask arranged for heating in a water bath. The flask is provided with a dropping funnel, a condenser, and a receiver cooled in a Dry Ice bath; this receiver is connected to a second one containing 20 ml. of anhydrous ether; the inlet tube of the second receiver should dip below the surface of the ether.\nThe water bath is heated to 70\u201375\u00b0, and one-half of a solution prepared by dissolving 15.8 g. (0.1 mole) of N-nitroso-\u03b2-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone in a mixture of 80 ml. of anhydrous ether and 12 ml. of isopropyl alcohol is added through the dropping funnel at a rate slightly greater than that of distillation. When the separatory funnel is empty, an additional 15 ml. of the solution of sodium isopropoxide is added; the remainder of the solution of nitroso compound is then added as before. Anhydrous ether is then added gradually through the dropping funnel until the condensing ether becomes colorless. The diazomethane comes over with the ether as a golden yellow distillate. The process can be continued until all the nitrosoaminoketone has been decomposed. The yield of diazomethane, which varies with the purity of the nitrosoaminoketone, is 1.9\u20132.5 g (45\u201360%).",
            "C. Diazomethane. Sodium cyclohexoxide method (Note 10). A solution of sodium cyclohexoxide is prepared from 4 g. of sodium and 100 ml. of cyclohexanol (Note 11) in a 2-l. flask; the cyclohexanol is heated to boiling under reflux to speed up the formation of the alkoxide. As soon as the sodium has disappeared, heating is discontinued and the condenser is removed. When solid begins to separate from the solution, the mixture is stirred with a stout rod to prevent the formation of a hard cake. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and, when the temperature of the mixture has dropped to 10\u00b0, 300 ml. of dry ether and a solution of 49 g. (0.33 mole) of N-nitroso-\u03b2-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone dissolved in 600 ml. of dry ether are added. The flask is connected to a 25-cm. fractionating column and an efficient water-cooled condenser (Note 12). The delivery end of the condenser should be connected to an adapter which dips below the surface of 50 ml. of ether contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath. The mixture is heated by a water bath whose temperature is maintained at 50\u201355\u00b0. Distillation is continued until the condensing ether is colorless; usually 700\u2013750 ml. of distillate containing 10\u201311 g. (77\u201384% yield) (Note 13) of diazomethane is collected (Note 14) and (Note 15).

            "In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a 90-cm. air-cooled condenser are placed 288 g. (3 moles) of freshly distilled furfural, 460 g. (425 ml., 4.5 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 294 g. (3 moles) of dry, pulverized, freshly fused potassium acetate (Note 1). The ingredients are mixed thoroughly, stirring is started, and the flask is heated in an oil bath at 150\u00b0 (bath temperature) for 4 hours, without interruption (Note 2). It is well to make provision for acetic acid vapor which escapes through the air condenser.\nAfter cooling slightly, the reaction mixture is transferred to a large flask and treated with 3.5 l. of water. Part of this is used to rinse out the reaction flask. The mixture is boiled with 30 g. of Norit for about 10 minutes and is filtered while still hot with suction, using a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel. Furylacrylic acid tends to separate quickly and sometimes offers trouble in clogging the funnel. The filtrate is acidified to Congo red by the addition of a 1:1 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid in water. After being cooled to 20\u00b0 or below, preferably with stirring, and being allowed to stand for at least 1 hour, the acid is filtered with suction and washed with a small quantity of ice water. The yield is 270\u2013290 g. (65\u201370%). The light tan crude acid melts at 138\u2013139\u00b0 (Note 3)"

When the temperature of the solution has fallen to 5\u00b0, the ice bath is removed, and 100 g. (0.66 mole) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde (Note 2) is added in one portion. The temperature rises slowly at first, reaching 25\u201330\u00b0 in about 5 minutes. As it then rises rapidly to about 100\u00b0 the ice-salt bath is again placed around the beaker. Stirring must be vigorous or the reaction mixture may be forced out of the beaker (Note 3). During the reaction the m-nitrobenzaldehyde dissolves, and an almost clear red solution is obtained. The solution is cooled with very slow stirring (Note 4) in an ice-salt mixture for 2.5 hours. The orange-red paste of the stannichloride of m-aminobenzaldehyde (Note 5) is filtered on a sintered-glass funnel (Note 6).\nA suspension of the material in 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is stirred mechanically in a 3-l. beaker which is set in an ice-salt bath. A solution of 46 g. of sodium nitrite in 150 ml. of water in a 250-ml. dropping funnel fixed with its stem below the surface of the suspension is added slowly while the temperature of the mixture is kept at 4\u20135\u00b0 (Note 7). After the addition is completed (in approximately 80 minutes), stirring in the ice-salt bath is continued for 1 hour to crystallize completely the stannichloride of the diazonium salt. The reddish brown salt is filtered on a sintered glass funnel (Note 6).\nThe damp salt is added cautiously in small portions to 1.7 l. of boiling water in a 4-l. beaker in the course of 40 minutes. During the reaction, the water lost by vaporization is replaced (Note 8). The solution is treated with 4 g. of Norit, boiled a few minutes, and filtered hot.

The apparatus is set up in a hood, and a gas-absorption trap is attached to the top of the condenser.\nIn the flask is placed 542 g. (4.55 moles) of thonyl chloride; to this is added dropwise, and with rapid stirring, 352 g. (4 moles) of isobutyric acid (Note 2).

Stirring is continued throughout the heating. The reaction mixture is then distilled through a 30-cm. Vigreux column by means of an oil bath heated on a hot plate (Note 3). The fore-run boiling up to 89\u00b0 weighs 44 g. The isobutyryl chloride which is collected at 89\u201393\u00b0 weighs 351 g. The residue weighs 49 g. On combining the fore-run and residue and redistilling slowly, an additional 33 g. of isobutyryl chloride is obtained; the total yield is 384 g. (90%).

To this 318 g. (3 moles) of isobutyryl chloride is added dropwise with rapid stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 15\u00b0, and the evolution of white fumes (mostly ammonium chloride) does not become vigorous. Stirring is continued for 1 hour after the addition of the acid chloride is finished.\nThe flask is heated by steam in a large can, and the reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (Note 6). The dry residue of ammonium chloride and isobutyramide is boiled 10 minutes with 2 l. of dry ethyl acetate, and the boiling solution is filtered quickly through a fluted filter paper on a large hot funnel. The residue on the filter is extracted in the same way with two 1-l. portions of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are cooled to 0\u00b0, and the crystalline amide which separates is removed by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated to about 300 ml. and chilled, and a second crop of amide is collected (Note 7) and (Note 8). The two crops of isobutyramide are combined and dried, first in an oven at 70\u00b0 for 3 hours and then in a vacuum desiccator.

            "A. Ethyl phenylacetylmalonate. A 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a dropping funnel (Note 1) and a reflux condenser provided with a calcium chloride tube. Before the apparatus is assembled, it is washed in the following manner with absolute ethanol which has been prepared in a distilling flask (Note 2). Ninety milliliters of the anhydrous ethanol is distilled through the dropping funnel into the apparatus, used for rinsing, and discarded. In the reaction flask are placed 12.5 g. (0.52 atom) of magnesium turnings, 1 ml. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 3), and 40 g. (0.25 mole) of malonic ester (Note 3); then 90 ml. of absolute ethanol is distilled into the dropping funnel and transferred to the flask. The reaction is started by heating and is controlled by applying an ice bath when the condenser begins to flood. When the reaction has subsided, 40 g. (0.25 mole) more of malonic ester is added at one time. After this reaction has subsided, the flask is cooled slightly, 180 ml. of dry ether is added, and the reaction mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour. Then 88 g. (74 ml., 0.57 mole) of phenylacetyl chloride, diluted with 90 ml. of dry ether, is added slowly (in about 30 minutes) from the dropping funnel in portions at such a rate that the vigorous reaction subsides between additions. When the addition has been completed, the flask is warmed for 10 minutes on a steam bath. After the mixture has been cooled, 100 ml. of water is added dropwise in about 30 minutes. The oily layer is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump). The crude phenylacetylmalonic ester (87 ml.) which remains is a reddish, somewhat viscous oil.",
            "B. Ethyl 1,3-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate. In a 1-l. flask 1 volume (87 ml.) of the crude ester is added in one lot to 3 volumes (261 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid without cooling, and the solution is allowed to stand for about 1 week (Note 4). The whole mixture, including any precipitate which may have formed, is poured slowly with stirring into a mixture of 1 kg. of ice and 500 ml. of water (Note 5); the solid yellow ester is filtered with suction, washed with a small amount of cold water, pressed in the filter for 30 minutes with a rubber dam, and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of ester melting at 80\u00b0 is 58\u201368 g. (50\u201359% based on the malonic ester used).\nRecrystallization of 50 g. of the ester from 300 ml. of 70% ethanol (Note 6) yields 45 g. of yellow, needle-like crystals melting at 82\u00b0.",
            "C. 1,3-Dihydroxy-2-napthoic acid. In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet tube, and a condenser carrying a separatory funnel attached by means of a notched cork, is placed 20.9 g. (0.09 mole) of the recrystallized ester dissolved in 300 ml. of dioxane. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, the solution is stirred and heated on a steam bath, and a solution of 40 g. (0.13 mole) of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 500 ml. of water is added in the course of 1 hour. Heating and stirring are continued for 3 hours. The precipitated barium salt, which may vary in color from yellow to greenish gray, is filtered from the hot solution and transferred immediately to a cool (25\u00b0) solution of 11 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 185 ml. of water in a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, a mechanical stirrer, and a condenser. The mixture is stirred in an atmosphere of nitrogen for 5 minutes without heating (Note 7). The precipitate is removed by filtration, washed with a small amount of distilled water, transferred to a beaker, and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of hot absolute ethanol. To the warm filtrate is added 200 ml. of water, and the solution is allowed to cool in an ice bath for 2 hours. The yield of the crude acid which is obtained by filtration as a fine, yellow powder melting at 135\u00b0 (Note 8) is 16.5 g. (90%).",
            "D. Naphthoresorcinol. In a 200-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a stirrer, and a condenser, is placed 65 ml. of water; the water is then boiled to expel dissolved oxygen. To the boiling water is added 16.5 g. of the crude acid (Note 9), and the mixture is boiled with stirring for 2 hours in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The water is decanted from any pasty residue; the residue is boiled with 35 ml. of water for 2 hours, and the supernatant liquid is decanted through a filter and combined with the first solution. Just enough sodium hydrosulfite (about 0.3\u20130.5 g.) is added to decolorize the red solution, 15 g. of sodium chloride is dissolved in the solution, and the mixture is allowed to stand at 5\u00b0 for 24 hours. The naphthoresorcinol precipitates first as an oil, which solidifies to a reddish solid on further cooling, and then as colorless or slightly yellow plates. The yield is 7.0\u20137.3 g. (54\u201356%). After standing over calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator for 1 day, the white or slightly yellow plates melt at 119\u2013122\u00b0 and the reddish solid melts at 110\u2013118\u00b0.\nTo 100 ml. of hot water are added 3.5 g. of the reddish solid, just enough sodium hydrosulfite to remove the red coloration, and 0.3 g. of Norit. The mixture is filtered, 7 g. of sodium chloride is dissolved in the filtrate, and the solution is allowed to stand in a closed container at 5\u00b0 for 24 hours. The yield of naphthoresorcinol, which separates as large, nearly transparent plates melting at 122\u2013124\u00b0 (Note 10), is 2.6 g. (75% recovery)."

The filtrate and washings are combined in a 6-gal. crock (Note 6) and cooled immediately (Note 7) by the addition of enough ice to bring the temperature to 0\u00b0 to \u22122\u00b0 and leave at least 1 kg. of ice unmelted.\nTo this cold solution or suspension of \u03b2-phenylhydroxylamine, a cold solution of sulfuric acid (750 ml. of concentrated acid and sufficient ice to bring the temperature down to \u22125\u00b0) is added with stirring. An ice-cold solution of 170 g. of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 500\u2013750 ml. of water is added as rapidly as it can be poured into the mixture, which is stirred or swirled (Note 8). After 2 to 3 minutes, the straw-colored precipitate of nitrosobenzene is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 1 l. of water (Note 9).\nThe crude nitrosobenzene is steam-distilled (Note 10), and the distillate is collected in a receiver cooled by ice (Note 11). The nitrosobenzene is finely ground in a mortar, transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel, and washed with water until the washings are no longer brown. After it has been sucked as dry as possible on the filter the nitrosobenzene is pressed between layers of filter paper (or other porous paper). One or two changes of paper may be necessary. The yield of nitrosobenzene melting at 64\u201367\u00b0 is 128\u2013138 g. (49\u201353%) (Note 12) and (Note 13). If a purer product is desired, the crude nitrosobenzene can be recrystallized from a small amount of ethanol with good cooling, and the product dried over calcium chloride at atmospheric pressure."

(4.2 moles) of freshly distilled thionyl chloride (Note 1) is added from the dropping funnel at the rate of 3\u20135 drops per second. When one-third to one-half of the thionyl chloride has been added, a pasty crystalline mass begins to separate and the temperature begins to rise rapidly. The temperature should not be allowed to go above 60\u00b0. As more thionyl chloride is added the mass redissolves and a dark brown liquid forms. When the addition is complete, the bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 3\u20134 hours. The liquid (or the slurry, if some crystallization has occurred) is poured into a beaker (Note 2) and extracted seven times with 500-ml. portions of ether (Note 3); the ether extracts are decanted and combined. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is washed three times with 100-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled under reduced pressure.
