Then 30 mL of a solution of 2-bromonaphthalene (200.7 g, 0.97 mol) (Note 8) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (675 mL) (Note 9) is added. As soon as the reaction has started (Note 10), the remainder of the tetrahydrofuran solution is added at such a rate that a gentle reflux is maintained (Note 11).

During the addition the internal temperature should not exceed 20\u00b0C (Note 13) and (Note 14). After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 1.5 hr using an oil bath, then cooled to room temperature.\nFor workup, an aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution (1.6 L) is carefully added, cooling the mixture with an ice bath (Note 15) and (Note 16). The mixture is extracted once with ethyl acetate (500 mL) (Note 17). After separation of the layers, the aqueous phase is extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 250 mL). The combined organic layers are washed twice with brine (2 \u00d7 250 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator at 45\u00b0C/100 mm. The resulting yellowish foam (200 g) (Note 18) and (Note 19) is dissolved in diethyl ether (100 mL) followed by the addition of ethanol (400 mL). After a few minutes a white solid precipitates that is the clathrate of the product with ethanol (Note 20). After standing for several hours (or overnight), the crystals are filtered, washed with ethanol/diethyl ether (300 mL, 4:1), and ethanol (100 mL), and then dried overnight at 50\u00b0C/8 mm to give 125\u2013130 g of colorless crystals (Note 21).\nIn order to remove the ethanol, the crystals are dissolved in toluene (3 mL per g of clathrate) at 70\u00b0C, and the solution is evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 45\u00b0C/100 mm. This procedure is repeated once more. A portion of the solid so obtained (68.5 g) is mixed with toluene (800 mL) at 80\u00b0C in a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead, mechanical stirrer, until the TADDOL [(R,R)-2,2-dimethyl-\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1',\u03b1'-tetra(naphth-2-yl)-1,3-dioxolane-4',5'-dimethanol] is completely dissolved.

The mixture is allowed to cool completely to room temperature, and the resulting thick slurry is stirred overnight. Further solvent ( 500 mL of a 1 : 1 mixture of toluene-hexane ) is added to the now unstirrable suspension. The mixture is shaken vigorously to give a stirrable slurry. The solid is removed by vacuum filtration and washed first with the mother liquor, then with a 1 : 1 toluene/hexane mixture (300 mL), and finally with hexane (300 mL).

The zinc powder is activated by the addition of 1,2-dibromoethane (1.5 mL, 3.5 g, 0.02 mol) via syringe followed by warming the mixture at reflux for 1 min and then allowing the mixture to cool to room temperature. A small amount of chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl) is added via syringe, whereupon evolution of ethylene gas is observed (Note 3). The mixture is stirred for 45 min, and then N-methylbenzimine (23.8 g, 0.2 mol) is added in one portion via syringe, followed by anhydrous acetonitrile (100 mL). The septum is replaced with an addition funnel (100 mL), and chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 4) (32.5 g, 38 mL, 0.3 mol) is slowly added (30 min) at a rate that maintains the internal temperature below 30\u00b0C.

Isoprene (10.2 g, 15 mL, 0.15 mol) is slowly added from the addition funnel while the solution is stirred vigorously. An exothermic reaction occurs, and the internal temperature is maintained below 40\u00b0C with the aid of a water bath. The lithium pieces become brilliant and the solution turns dark red. The course of the reaction is carefully monitored by TLC (Note 10) until the meso-diamine is isomerized into the dl-isomer. This takes approximately 1-2 hr. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 0\u00b0C, and the excess lithium metal is removed by gravity filtration through a funnel containing a plug of glass wool.

An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an argon inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 150-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with argon and charged with 30.8 g (0.726 mol, 2 equiv) of anhydrous lithium chloride (Note 1), 60.0 g (0.363 mol, 1 equiv) of (R,R)-(\u2212)-pseudoephedrine (Note 2), and 500 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 3). The resulting slurry is cooled in an ice bath. After 15 min, 6.89 g (0.182 mol, 0.5 equiv) of solid lithium methoxide (Note 4) is added to the reaction flask in one lot. The resulting mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 10 min, after which time the pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with a solution of 40.4 g (0.454 mol, 1.25 equiv) of glycine methyl ester (Note 5) in 100 mL of dry THF (Note 3), and dropwise addition of this solution is initiated. The addition is completed within 1 hr, and the reaction flask is maintained at 0\u00b0C for an additional 7 hr. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 500 mL of water. The bulk of the THF is removed from the resulting colorless solution by concentration under reduced pressure. An additional 250 mL of water is added to the aqueous concentrate, and the resulting aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted sequentially with one 500-mL and four 250-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The clear, colorless, oily residue is dissolved in 300 mL of warm (50\u00b0C) THF (Note 3), 10 mL of water is added, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to 23\u00b0C, whereupon the product crystallizes as its monohydrate within 1 hr. The crystallization process is completed by cooling the crystallization flask to \u221220\u00b0C. After standing for 2 hr at \u221220\u00b0C, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 200 mL of ether . The crystals are dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23\u00b0C for 2 hr to provide 62.8 g (72%) of (R,R)-(\u2212)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide monohydrate (Note 6).\nDehydration of the monohydrate is initiated by suspending the crystalline solid (62.8 g) in 1.2 L of dichloromethane ; the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously for 1 hr to break up any large lumps of solid. After 1 hr of vigorous stirring, 60 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate is added to the fine dispersion (Note 7). After the suspension is stirred for 10 min, it becomes translucent. At this point the mixture is filtered through 40 g of Celite in a 10 cm-i.d. B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with a Whatman #1 filter paper. The clear, colorless filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved in 200 mL of toluene , and the resulting solution is concentrated to remove any residual dichloromethane. The oily concentrate is then dissolved in 175 mL of hot (60\u00b0C) toluene , and the resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23\u00b0C. Crystallization of the product may occur spontaneously within 1-3 hr at 23\u00b0C; however, if necessary, it can be initiated by scratching the side of the flask until crystals are observed. Once crystallization is initiated, the crystals are broken up periodically with a spatula to obtain a fine powder that is easily manipulated. After 30 min from the onset of crystallization, the flask is cooled to \u221220\u00b0C under an argon atmosphere to complete the crystallization process. After standing at \u221220\u00b0C for 2 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 200 mL of ether . The product is dried by transferring the solid to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum adapter and evacuating the flask (0.5 mm). After 1 hr at 23\u00b0C, the flask is immersed in an oil bath at 60\u00b0C (Note 8). After 12 hr, the flask is cooled to 23\u00b0C to afford 53.8 g (67% overall) of anhydrous (R,R)-(\u2212)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide (Note 9).",
            "B. Pseudoephedrine L-allylglycinamide . A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum through which is placed a needle connected to a source of vacuum and argon. The system is evacuated, the flask is flame-dried and then allowed to cool to 23\u00b0C under reduced pressure. When the reaction flask has cooled to 23\u00b0C, it is flushed with argon and charged with 200 mL of dry THF (Note 3) and 63.0 mL (0.450 mol, 1.025 equiv) of diisopropylamine (Note 10). The resulting solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. With efficient stirring, the solution is deoxygenated at 0\u00b0C by alternately evacuating the reaction vessel and flushing with argon three times. After the solution is deoxygenated, 167 mL (0.439 mol, 1 equiv) of a 2.63 M solution of butyllithium in hexanes (Note 11) and (Note 12) is added via syringe over a 20-min period. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 15 min.\nSeparately, a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an inlet adapter connected to a source of vacuum and argon, two rubber septa, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with 57.2 g (1.35 mol, 6 equiv) of anhydrous lithium chloride (Note 1) and, with efficient stirring of the solid, the reaction vessel is evacuated and flame-dried. The flask and its contents are allowed to cool to 23\u00b0C under reduced pressure. When the flask has cooled to 23\u00b0C, it is flushed with argon, 50.0 g (0.225 mol, 1 equiv) of solid (R,R)-(\u2212)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide is added, and one of the septa is replaced with a Teflon thermometer adapter fitted with a thermometer for internal measurement of the reaction temperature. The solids are suspended in 500 mL of dry THF (Note 3) and the resulting milky-white slurry is cooled to an internal temperature of 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. With efficient stirring, the slurry is deoxygenated by alternately evacuating the reaction vessel and flushing with argon three times.\nThe two reaction flasks are connected via a wide-bore (14 gauge) cannula so that one end of the cannula is immersed in the lithium diisopropylamide solution and the other is suspended above the (R,R)-(\u2212)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide-lithium chloride slurry. The flask containing the lithium diisopropylamide solution and its ice bath are raised to a height just above that of the flask containing the glycinamide slurry. The reaction flask containing the glycinamide slurry is very briefly evacuated to initiate siphon transfer of the lithium diisopropylamide solution. Once the siphon flow is established, the flask containing the glycinamide slurry is flushed with argon. By raising or lowering the height of the flask containing the lithium diisopropylamide solution, the rate of addition is modulated so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 5\u00b0C (approximately 45 min addition time) (Note 13). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 30 min (Note 14). To the resulting pale yellow suspension is added 19.5 mL (0.225 mol) of allyl bromide (Note 15) via syringe over a 20-min period. The rate of addition of allyl bromide is also modulated to prevent the internal reaction temperature from rising above 5\u00b0C (Note 16). After the addition of allyl bromide is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 45 min at 0\u00b0C. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 500 mL of water. The resulting biphasic mixture is slowly acidified by the addition of 300 mL of 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The biphasic mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and is extracted with 1 L of ethyl acetate . The organic layer is separated and extracted sequentially with 300 mL of 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and 300 mL of 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The aqueous layers are combined and cooled to an internal temperature of 5\u00b0C by stirring in an ice bath. The cold aqueous solution is then cautiously made basic (pH 14) by the slow addition of 120 mL of aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide solution. The temperature of the solution should not be allowed to rise above 25\u00b0C during the addition of base. The basic solution is extracted sequentially with one 500-mL portion and four 250-mL portions of dichloromethane (Note 17). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved in 200 mL of toluene , and the resulting solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove residual dichloromethane and diisopropylamine.

The flask and its contents are cooled to \u221270\u00b0C with a dry ice/acetone bath. After the apparatus has cooled, 76.9 mL of a 1.6 M hexane solution of butyllithium (123 mmol) is added dropwise using a 100-mL syringe over a period of 15 min. The reaction temperature is kept below \u221240\u00b0C (Note 4). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is further stirred for 10 min at \u221270\u00b0C and warmed to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath for 1 hr to afford lithium pentafluoropropen-2-olate , 1, (Note 5). To the pale yellow solution is added dropwise 4.8 mL (66 mmol) of propionaldehyde (Note 6) via a syringe over 30 min, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 0\u00b0C.

The reaction mixture is magnetically stirred (900 rpm) for 18 hr (Note 4) in the autoclave at 180\u00b0C.\nThe autoclave is removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature. After the coproduct, carbon dioxide , is released by the purging valve, the autoclave is opened, and the pale-yellow suspension is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel (Note 5). Water (120 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate (25 g), which is then filtered off and washed with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether .\nThe solvent and excess dimethyl carbonate are removed by rotary evaporation, and the remaining yellow liquid (13.2 g of 2) is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (10%, 60 mL) is added to the flask, and the mixture is heated with magnetic stirring in an oil bath at reflux temperature for 4.5 hr (Note 6). The course of the reaction is monitored by gas-chromatographic analysis (Note 7). After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is extracted with diethyl ether to remove nonacidic material (primarily traces of amide). An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (15%, 50 mL) is added portionwise (Note 8). The suspension that forms is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (60 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the yellow liquid residue is distilled from a 25-mL flask, under reduced pressure, in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 2-cm Vigreux column and a fused-on Liebig condenser. Distillation affords 2-phenylpropionic acid (3) (14.3 g, 93%) as a pale-yellow liquid, bp 93-94\u00b0C/0.9 mm (lit.2 bp 147\u00b0C/11 mm), with > 98% purity by gas chromatography (Note 9)."

Distillation of the residue in a Claisen flask gives the following fractions: Head fraction, from 50\u00b0C to 74\u00b0C/130 mm (21.16 g) containing 60% of chlorohexene (Note 7); central fraction, 74-75\u00b0C/130 mm (93.00 g, 0.78 mol, 82% yield) consisting of almost pure chlorohexene (Note 8); residue, clear yellow, about 1 mL.\n8-Chloro-1-octene . Similarly, the reaction of 1-bromo-5-chloropentane (Note 9) (88.37 g, 0.47 mol) with a solution of allylmagnesium bromide prepared as above from allyl bromide (90.75 g, 0.75 mol) and magnesium turnings (45.00 g, 1.87 mol), gives, after the usual treatment, 60.14 g of 8-chloro-1-octene (86% yield), bp 75-76\u00b0C/20 mm (Note 10)."

The flask is connected to a trap (Note 3) that is cooled at \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice-ethanol bath and attached to a vacuum pump (Figure 1). The flask is charged with powdered cerium(III) chloride heptahydrate (CeCl3\u00b77H2O, 44.7 g, 0.12 mol) (Note 4) and evacuated to 0.1-0.2 mm. After gradual warming to 90\u00b0C over 30 min with an oil bath, the flask is heated at 90-100\u00b0C for 2 hr with intermittent shaking (Note 5). The system is filled with dry argon and cooled to room temperature. The solid is transferred to a mortar and quickly pulverized with a pestle. The resulting white powder and a magnetic stirring bar (Note 6) are placed in the original flask. Gradual warming to 90\u00b0C at 0.1-0.2 mm over 30 min, followed by further evacuating at 90-100\u00b0C for 1.5 hr with intermittent shaking, gives cerium(III) chloride monohydrate (CeCl3\u00b7H2O) (Note 7). The cerium(III) chloride monohydrate is gradually warmed to 140\u00b0C over 30 min under reduced pressure (0.1-0.2 mm) without stirring (Note 8). Heating at 140-150\u00b0C/0.1-0.2 mm for 2 hr with gentle stirring (Note 9) affords a fine, white powder of anhydrous cerium(III) chloride (Note 10). While the flask is still hot, the area that is not immersed in the oil bath is heated by the use of a heat gun in order to remove traces of water. After introduction of argon into the flask, the resulting anhydrous cerium(III) chloride is cooled to room temperature. One of the glass stoppers is replaced by a rubber septum in a stream of dry argon.\nFigure 1. Apparatus for the preparation of anhydrous cerium(III) chloride.\nTetrahydrofuran (200 mL) (Note 11) is added to the powder of anhydrous cerium(III) chloride in one portion at 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath with vigorous stirring (Note 12). After the mixture is stirred under argon atmosphere at room temperature overnight (Note 13), the resulting milky suspension is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-ethanol bath. A 1.54 M hexane solution of butyllithium (78 mL, 0.12 mmol) is added dropwise over 15 min to the suspension, so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at \u221278\u00b0C. The resulting yellow suspension is stirred at the same temperature for 30 min, and \u03b1-tetralone (13.5 mL, 14.8 g, 0.101 mol) (Note 14) is added to the mixture at \u221278\u00b0C over 15-30 min. After the mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 30 min, the dry ice-ethanol bath is removed, and the pale yellow suspension is warmed to room temperature. An aqueous 5% solution of acetic acid (200 mL) is added to the suspension with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and ethyl acetate (100 mL) is added. The organic layer is separated, and the water layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed sequentially with brine (50 mL), a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (50 mL), and brine (50 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After evaporation of the solvent by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, distillation of the residual oil gives 19.1-19.9 g of 1-butyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol (92-97%) (Note 15) and (Note 16) as a colorless oil, 103-104\u00b0C/0.5 mm."

            "Ethyl 5-(3-oxocyclohexyl)pentanoate . A 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a septum, is cooled under a stream of argon (Note 1), and charged with 3.0 g of zinc powder (46 mmol , (Note 2)), followed by 16 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 3). To this mixture is added 155 \u03bcL of 1,2-dibromoethane (338 mg, 1.8 mmol, (Note 4)), and the stirred slurry is heated to ca. 65\u00b0C (Note 5) for 1 min using a heat gun. The flask is then placed in a water bath (ca. 23\u00b0C) with continued magnetic stirring. After one minute, 155 \u03bcL of chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS-Cl) (133 mg, 1.2 mmol, (Note 6)) is added, and the slurry is stirred for 15 min (Note 7). The flask is wrapped in aluminum foil and 6.7 mL of neat ethyl 5-iodovalerate (10.24 g, 40.0 mmol, (Note 8)) is slowly added dropwise over 10 min. The flask is placed in a 35\u00b0C oil bath and stirred overnight. Initially, the reaction is very exothermic, and THF can be seen slowly refluxing around the neck of the round-bottomed flask. Dry Ice is used to cool the neck of the flask to avoid leaching the septum with THF. Twelve hours later (overnight, (Note 9)), when the reaction is judged complete by TLC (Note 10), the aluminum foil and the oil bath are removed. The presence of a white \"dust\" that never quite settles is noted. The reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature and 20 mL of THF is added to the stirred slurry. Stirring is stopped, the solids are allowed to settle as much as possible (vida supra), and the THF solution of the alkylzinc iodide is transferred via canula to a clean, dry 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar and a septum. Two additional washes of the remaining excess zinc with THF (29 mL each) are carried out to ensure complete transfer and proper dilution of the alkylzinc iodide (0.38 M). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C, and methyllithium (MeLi) in ether (26 mL, 36 mmol, (Note 11)) is added dropwise over 15 min.\nWhile the alkylzinc is being formed, a 25-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stir bar and septum is cooled under argon, and charged with 178.9 mg of copper(I) cyanide (CuCN) (2.0 mmol, (Note 12)), followed by 10 mL of THF . The mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and MeLi in ether (2.86 mL, 4.0 mmol, (Note 11)) is added slowly over 10 min. When the addition of MeLi is complete, the slurry is gently warmed until the reaction mixture becomes homogeneous at which point it is recooled to \u221278\u00b0C. With both solutions at \u221278\u00b0C, the higher-order dimethylcyanocuprate is transferred via canula to the alkylzinc reagent. After 5 min at \u221278\u00b0C, 7.77 mL of neat TMS-Cl (6.65 g, 61.3 mmol, (Note 6)) is added dropwise over 10 min, followed by 10 min of stirring. Finally, 2.02 mL of neat 2-cyclohexen-1-one (2.01 g, 20.9 mmol, (Note 13)) is added dropwise over 15 min via syringe. After 4.5 hr, the reaction is complete as determined by TLC (Note 14) and it is quenched by pouring the reaction mixture into 200 mL of pH 7 buffer (Note 15) and 200 mL of diethyl ether (Et2O) in a 1-L separatory funnel. An additional 25 mL of ether is used to complete the transfer of the reaction mixture to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is further extracted with an additional 50 mL of ether . The combined organic layers are shaken for 5 min with 50 mL of 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF (Note 16), followed by three washes with 100 mL of brine . The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). Gravity filtration, concentration under reduced pressure, and flash chromatography on silica gel (Note 17) using 10:1 ( petroleum ether : ethyl acetate ) affords 4.02 g of slightly contaminated product (Note 18). Warming this material at 50\u00b0C on a Kugelrohr apparatus for 2 hr at 0.5 mm affords 3.46 g (73%) of pure 5-(3-oxocyclohexyl)pentanoate as a pale-yellow liquid (Note 19)."

A 2-L photo-reaction vessel equipped with a quartz immersion well, a thermometer, an argon-inlet tube, a mineral oil outlet-bubbler, a mechanical stirrer, and supported in an adequately sized Dewar (Note 1), is charged with 13.5 g (34 mmol) of ergosterol (1) (Note 2), 1.31 g (6.8 mmol) of ethyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate , and 1.7 L of tert-butyl methyl ether (tert-BuOMe) (Note 3). The mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight with gentle bubbling of argon (Note 4). A 450-watt Hanovia medium-pressure mercury lamp is inserted into the well, through which a fast stream of water is continuously passed (Note 5). The solution is cooled in a dry ice-ethanol bath and stirred vigorously (Note 6). When the temperature of the solution reaches 0\u00b0C, the lamp is turned on, and irradiation is continued at 0\u00b0C to \u221220\u00b0C for 4 hr (Note 7). The lamp is turned off, a solution of 75 mg (0.34 mmol) of 9-acetylanthracene (Note 8) in 3 mL of tert-BuOMe is added to the solution, and a uranium filter (Note 9) is inserted into the arc housing (Note 10). After 10 min, the lamp is started again, and the mixture is irradiated at 0\u00b0C to \u221220\u00b0C for 1 hr through the uranium filter (Note 11). The cold, pale yellow solution of pre-vitamin 2 thus obtained (Note 12) is transferred to a 3-L, round-bottomed flask and concentrated at 20-25\u00b0C under reduced pressure. The residue is transferred again to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask using tert-BuOMe to allow quantitative transfer. The solution is concentrated and dried at room temperature under high vacuum (1 mm) for 30 min to give approximately 15.4 g of a yellow resin. The flask is filled with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Methanol (100 mL) is added, and the mixture is shaken to give a stirrable suspension. The suspension is then stirred for 45 min at room temperature and stored in a freezer overnight. After the mixture is stirred at \u221230\u00b0C (Note 13) for 30 min, it is quickly filtered through a 60-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity. The collected solid is washed with 20 mL of cold methanol (Note 14). Ergosterol (1.83 g, 14% recovery, mp 145-151\u00b0C, 99.4% pure) is recovered by washing this solid with absolute ethanol (30 mL at room temperature). The filtrate and cold-methanol wash are transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, an argon-inlet tube, and a reflux condenser. The flask is flushed with argon, and the orange solution is heated under reflux for 6 hr (Note 15) and then stirred at 35-40\u00b0C overnight (Note 16). The mixture is concentrated at 30\u00b0C under reduced pressure, and the residual methanol is removed by coevaporation with 50 mL of toluene at 30\u00b0C to give approximately 14.6 g of an orange-tan oil. The flask is filled with argon and then equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The residue is dissolved in 40 mL of pyridine , and the solution is cooled in an ice-water bath. Solid 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (9.0 g, 39 mmol) (Note 17) is added in small portions over 5 min followed by 20 mL of pyridine to rinse the walls of the flask, and the mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 20 min. The very thick suspension obtained is shaken and then allowed to stand at 0\u00b0C for a further 20 min, whereupon methanol (30 mL) is added to the cold mixture. The mixture is allowed to stand at 0\u00b0C for 5 min, and then it is shaken for about 5 min to give a stirrable suspension. After the orange suspension is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1.5 hr, it is diluted by the dropwise addition of 150 mL of methanol over 15 min and stirred at 0\u00b0C for another hour. The yellow solid is collected by filtration, washed with 50 mL of ice-cold methanol , and dried at room temperature under high vacuum for 2 hr. The yellow-orange solid is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an argon-inlet tube. The flask is flushed with argon, and the solid is suspended in 50 mL of absolute ethanol . The suspension is stirred at room temperature for 15 min and at 0\u00b0C for 45 min.

The flask is flushed with argon, and 1.88 mL (18.8 mmol) of 10 N sodium hydroxide is added. After the purple suspension is stirred at room temperature for 45 min, it is cooled with an ice-water bath. Then, 75 mL of ethanol-water (EtOH-H2O)(2:5) is added over 5 min, and the mixture is stirred for 1 hr with ice-water cooling. To the resulting rose-colored suspension is added 100 mL of EtOH-H2O (2:5) dropwise over 30 min. The mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 30 min and then stored in a refrigerator overnight. The precipitate (Note 12) is collected by filtration using a 60-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity, washed quickly with 50 mL of cold EtOH-H2O (3:2) (Note 20), and dried at room temperature under high vacuum to give 6.55 g of an off-white solid. This material is transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an argon-inlet tube.

The second neck of the flask is sealed with a rubber septum, and the mixture is deoxygenated by bubbling dry nitrogen through it for 15 min. Trifluoroacetic acid (0.45 mL, 5.8 mmol) is added in one portion by syringe, and the resulting mixture is stirred magnetically for 15 min at room temperature. Excess pyrrole (Note 2) is removed by rotary evaporation (5-20 mm) with warming (50-60\u00b0C) to yield a dark oil. The oil is taken up in a minimal amount (ca. 10 mL) of dichloromethane , and charged onto the top of a flash chromatography column (50 g of 230 - 400 mesh silica gel). The major fraction containing 1 and some higher oligomers is eluted with dichloromethane and collected (TLC is monitored with visualization using bromine vapor: Compound 1 turns bright red/orange, and the higher oligomers show beige to brown spots of lower Rf). Rotary evaporation of the solvent yields a tan oil that is transferred to a vacuum sublimation apparatus (50 mm \u00d7 200 mm) and subjected to high vacuum (0.01 mm). To allow residual pyrrole and solvent to escape, a slow heating rate (ca. 0.75\u00b0C/min) is maintained until visible sublimation sets in at approximately 120\u00b0C (Note 3).

Bis(1,5-dichloro-2,4-pentanedione)copper(II) complex .3 A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 250-mL addition funnel, reflux condenser, rubber septum with nitrogen inlet, and a magnetic stirrer bar. The reflux condenser is equipped with a line to an HCl trap (Note 1) and the apparatus is maintained under a positive flow of nitrogen. The flask is charged with aluminum chloride (65.0 g, 0.487 mol) followed by the addition of nitrobenzene (82 mL) (Caution! Evolution of HCl gas ) via the addition funnel. 1,2-Dichloroethane (96 mL) (Note 2) is added via the addition funnel and the mixture is stirred until all solids dissolve (ca. 15 min). The resulting olive green solution is placed in an ice bath, and the funnel is charged with 2,4-pentanedione (50.0 mL, 0.487 mol) (Note 3). The 2,4-pentanedione is added to the solution dropwise over 15 min (Caution! Evolution of HCl gas), and the funnel is charged with chloroacetyl chloride (85.0 mL, 1.07 mol) (Note 4). The chloroacetyl chloride is added to the solution dropwise over 15 min, followed by removal of the ice bath. The dark green solution is allowed to warm for 30 min. The reflux condenser is replaced with a thermometer and the addition funnel is replaced with a jacketed short path distillation head connected to a vacuum adapter. The vacuum adapter on the distillation head is connected to the HCl trap and the flask is immersed in an electrically heated oil bath equipped with a magnetic stirrer and external thermometer (Note 5). The reaction is slowly heated over 2 hr to 60\u00b0C (Note 6) when acetyl chloride begins to distill (collected at 39\u00b0C). The solution temperature is maintained between 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C for the course of the distillation (Note 7). When the distillate temperature falls below 35\u00b0C the oil bath is removed, and the solution is cooled to room temperature with an ice bath. The solution is poured into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 L of ice, concentrated hydrochloric acid (80 mL), and a magnetic stirrer bar. The reaction flask is rinsed with 1 N HCl (3 \u00d7 50 mL), and the washings are added to the Erlenmeyer flask. The rust colored reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 17 hr and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 150 mL) and the organic layers are combined. The organic layers are added to 1 L of a saturated copper(II) acetate solution in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask, and the resulting green-brown suspension is stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer for 3 hr. The solution is filtered through a Buchner funnel, and the green solid is washed with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The solid is triturated with 125 mL of diethyl ether , refiltered, and washed with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 75 mL) to give 55.6-56.4 g of product as a green-gray powder (57-58% based on 2,4-pentanedione) (Note 8).",

The flask is flame-dried under vacuum and cooled under oxygen-free dry argon (twice), and it is then charged with 1,5-cyclooctadieneruthenium(II) chloride (RuCl2, COD) (79.2 mg, 0.283 mmol) (Note 9) and [(S)-BINAP, 212 mg, 0.340 mmol] (Note 10). The flask and its contents are purged by evacuation and flushed with argon (twice). Triethylamine (Et3N, 470 \u03bcL, 3.37 mmol) (Note 11) is added via syringe followed by toluene (20 mL) via cannula. The solution is heated at reflux for 16 hr under argon, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting orange solution is concentrated by stirring while the flask is held at a vacuum of ca. 1 mm and the toluene and excess triethylamine are condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap to give crude [RuCl2-(S)-BINAP)]2-Et3N catalyst as an orange solid.\n1,5-Dichloro-2,4-pentanedione . A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is charged with bis(1,5-dichloro-2,4-pentanedione)copper(II) complex (22.0 g, 55.1 mmol) followed by diethyl ether (200 mL) and 10% sulfuric acid (200 mL). The reaction is stirred vigorously until all the solid dissolves (ca. 45 min). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined ether layers are washed with brine (2 \u00d7 300 mL) and dried (Na2SO4 ). The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether phase is concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude material (ca. 20 g) is hydrogenated without further purification (Note 12).\nThe crude dione (ca. 20 g) is dissolved in dry methanol (MeOH, 40 mL) (Note 13), and the solution is degassed with a stream of dry oxygen-free argon. This solution is transferred via cannula into the flask containing the freshly prepared [RuCl2-(S)-BINAP)]-Et3N catalyst under argon. The resulting suspension is stirred and heated with a hair dryer to dissolve the catalyst. The resulting solution is transferred via cannula under argon pressure into a flame-dried, 250-mL Schlenk flask sealed with a septum and vented with a syringe needle. The septum is replaced with a high-vacuum stopcock (Note 14) and the Schlenk flask is transferred to a nitrogen glove box where the contents are transferred to a 250-mL pressure reaction vessel equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The vessel is sealed (Note 15). The pressure vessel is then transferred from the glove box to an electrical heating jacket preheated to 70\u00b0C and the vessel is pressurized to 1250 psi with hydrogen gas in an explosion proof fume hood. The vessel is heated until the internal temperature is 65\u00b0C, and the contents are stirred with a magnetic stirrer at that temperature for 12-14 hr (Note 16). The vessel is cooled to room temperature and cautiously vented to discharge excess hydrogen gas. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and filtered through a plug of silica gel that is washed with 1:1 ethyl acetate/hexanes (ca. 300 mL). Solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the crude product is crystallized from a mixture of hexane:dichloromethane (2:3, v/v), and the solid is collected by suction filtration and rinsed with a mixture of hexane:CH2Cl2 (2:3, v/v). The off-white solid is recrystallized from hexane:CH2Cl2 (2:3, v/v), to give three crops of crystals (Note 17). The combined yield of the white crystalline product is 7.66 g (40%) (Note 18).",

The stirred heterogeneous reaction mixture is heated to reflux (105-118\u00b0C, (Note 3)) under a nitrogen atmosphere until completion of the reaction (Note 4). At the end of the reaction approximately 9 mL of water has collected in the Dean-Stark trap (Note 5).\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, filtered through a sintered glass funnel to remove inorganic salts, and the cake is washed with toluene (75 mL). The combined filtrate and wash are washed with water (150 mL). The organic layer is separated, and placed in a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The toluene solution is concentrated by reduced pressure distillation with mechanical stirring (45-50\u00b0C, 25-30 mm) to a volume of approximately 120 mL, and the final volume is adjusted to approximately 250 mL with toluene (Note 6).\nThe toluene solution is cooled to 10-15\u00b0C and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in 2-propanol (0.275 mol) (Note 7) is added slowly over 1 hr via a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, keeping the internal temperature below 25\u00b0C (Note 8). During the acid addition the product precipitates as its hydrochloride salt. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 hr, and is reduced in volume by distillation under reduced pressure (45-50\u00b0C, 25-30 mm) with mechanical stirring to produce a distillate of approximately 120 mL and a residual volume of about 100 mL. Toluene (50 mL) is added and the slurry is reconcentrated under reduced pressure (45-50\u00b0C, 25-30 mm) until a residual volume of 100 mL is obtained. This process is repeated once more (Note 9). Toluene is added to adjust the total volume to about 250 mL. The mixture is then cooled to 10-15\u00b0C and stirred under nitrogen at this temperature for 2 hr. The HCl salt is isolated by filtration and the wet cake is washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 50 mL).\nThe wet cake (Note 10) is transferred to a mixture of 100 mL of heptane and 138 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with stirring (Note 11). The two layers are separated. The aqueous layer (pH > 12) is extracted with heptane (75 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (50 mL), filtered through a cotton wool plug and concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator, ca. 30 mm). The residue is transferred to a three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer, and the volume is adjusted to 120 mL. The mechanically stirred solution is cooled to \u221225\u00b0C to form a slurry. The slurry is stirred under nitrogen at \u221225\u00b0C for 1 hr and then filtered through a precooled (\u221218\u00b0C, freezer) sintered glass funnel. The solid is rapidly washed with 25 mL of heptane that is precooled (freezer) and then dried by suction to give [R-(R,S)]-\u03b2-methyl-\u03b1-phenyl-1-pyrrolidineethanol as an off-white crystalline solid (45.9 g, 90% yield, (Note 12) and (Note 13))."

The flask is charged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL) followed by diisopropylamine (4.60 mL, 32.8 mmol). The solution is stirred at 0\u00b0C and BuLi is added (2.5 M solution in hexane, 12.2 mL, 30.4 mmol). After 15 min, tributyltin hydride (7.70 mL, 27.8 mmol, (Note 2)) is added and the resulting yellow solution is stirred for 20 min. The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C by means of a dry ice-acetone bath and crotonaldehyde (2.10 mL, 25.3 mmol, (Note 2)) is added. After 30 min a solution of 1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine (ADD) (8.31 g, 32.9 mmol, (Note 2)) in THF (65 mL) is added by means of a cannula. The resulting dark red reaction mixture is warmed to 0\u00b0C and stirred for 1 hr (Note 3). The reaction is then quenched with 100 mL of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 4) and extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether . The aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with 100 mL of ether . The organic extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 100 mL (Note 5). The orange solution is separated from a yellow precipitate by means of a cannula into a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer and containing 1 L of vigorously stirring hexane (Note 2) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 6). The resulting mixture is filtered through a glass-fritted funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to afford the crude acyl stannane as a clear orange oil. This oil is dissolved in 65 mL of THF and immediately subjected to reduction with 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl-lithium aluminum hydride (BINAL-H) (Part B).\nBecause of the lability of the acyl stannane it is important to have a freshly prepared solution of BINAL-H at \u221278\u00b0C ready for addition of the acyl stannane. This is best achieved by starting the following reduction procedure just prior to the acyl stannane sequence.",

The suspension is stirred at room temperature and a solution of ethanol (EtOH) (3.13 mL, 53.4 mmol, (Note 7)) in 10 mL of THF is added dropwise over a period of 15 min with vigorous evolution of hydrogen gas. The mixture is stirred for 20 min and a solution of (R)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (16.0 g, 55.8 mmol, (Note 8)) in 60 mL of THF is added over 1 hr by means of a cannula. The resulting cloudy, milky solution is refluxed for 2 hr (Note 9). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath and a solution of the acyl stannane in 65 mL of THF (Part A) is added over 45 min by means of a cannula.

The reaction is quenched by the careful addition of 100 mL of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution and diluted with 100 mL of water and 200 mL of ether . The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is acidified by the addition of 200 mL of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether . The organic layers are combined and washed with 200 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. Hexane (100 mL) is added and distilled from the solution by rotary evaporation to ensure complete removal of residual ether and THF (Note 11). The solid yellow residue is triturated with 200 mL of hexane and filtered. Solvent is removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation and the yellow oil is again triturated with 200 mL of hexane and filtered (Note 12). Solvent is again distilled from the filtrate by rotary evaporation to afford 8.97 g of crude hydroxy stannane as a yellow oil (Note 13).\nWhile the \u03b1-hydroxy stannane is not as labile as the acyl stannane precursor, it should generally be converted to the ether derivative immediately after isolation.",

After 5 hr the reaction is quenched with 100 mL of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether . The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is distilled by rotary evaporation. The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 14). Elution with hexane followed by EtOAc-hexane (1:9) affords 4.1-5 g (40-49% yield) of (S,E)-1-methoxymethyl)-1-tributylstannyl-2-butene (Note 15)."

An oven-dried complexation flask (Figure 1), fitted with an additional condenser (Note 1) and gas adapter, is charged with acetonitrile (300 mL). The solvent is heated to ~40\u00b0C under argon (Ar) (Note 2), chromium hexacarbonyl is added (45 g, 0.2 mol) (Note 3), and the mixture is immediately heated to reflux for 24 hr (Note 4). Toward the end of this time period (i.e., after ~20 hr), the cooling jacket attached to the flask is alternately filled with water and emptied to allow for complete digestion of the starting material. After complete conversion of the chromium hexacarbonyl is evident, the free condenser is quickly changed to a 9\"-Vigreux column connected through an acetone/solid carbon dioxide (CO2) condenser to a vacuum/argon line using a Firestone valve (Note 5). Vacuum (~0.1 mm) is quickly and cautiously applied to the system while simultaneously removing the heating source (Note 6). The reaction mixture is evaporated to complete dryness by warming the reaction flask with a warm water bath as necessary (Note 7). The system is filled with argon and a previously prepared solution of cycloheptatriene (1.5 eq., 0.31 mol, 28.3 g, 32 mL) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (50 mL) is added via syringe to the dry, bright yellow, solid tris(acetonitrile)chromium tricarbonyl intermediate. This addition is best performed under a very strong flow of argon through the top joint of the reaction apparatus. An additional 100 mL of THF is added to the mixture and the resulting solution is heated to reflux. After 48 hr, additional cycloheptatriene (1.0 eq., 0.2 mol, 20.5 g, 23 mL) is added and the reaction is continued until complete digestion of the (CH3CN)3Cr(CO)3 intermediate is evident (Note 8). Solvent is removed under reduced pressure (Note 9), and the residue is dissolved in a mixture of hexanes (225 mL) and methylene chloride (225 mL). Celite (5.0 g) is added to the solution and the mixture is filtered through a Celite pad (5.5 cm \u00d7 1.0 cm). The filter cake is washed with methylene chloride (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to provide an oily red solid. After the solids are dried briefly under vacuum (~2 hr, 0.1 mm), they are triturated with chilled hexanes (100 mL), and the chilled solids are collected via vacuum filtration and washed with chilled hexanes (50 mL). The solids are dried under vacuum (0.1 mm) to yield the dark red tricarbonyl(\u03b76-cycloheptatriene)chromium(0) (34.4-39.9 g, 75-85%, (Note 10)).\nFigure 1",

While the mixture is stirred it is purged with argon for 20-30 min and then 1-acetoxy-1,3-butadiene (1.5 eq., 7.4 g, 7.8 mL, 0.66 mol) is added via syringe (Note 12). The solution is irradiated (Note 13) using a Hanovia medium pressure 450W mercury vapor lamp (Note 14) for 6 hr or longer (Note 15) until complete digestion of the starting chromium complex is noted by TLC (Note 16). The reaction mixture is transferred, portionwise, to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask using diethyl ether, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure (Note 9). The residue is taken up in methanol (300 mL), with scraping as necessary, and the resultant slurry is stirred open to the atmosphere overnight. At this time, flash grade silica gel (10.0 g, Merck 230-400 mesh) is added to the green slurry and stirring is continued as necessary for complete decomplexation of the intermediate cycloadduct complex, as noted by TLC (Note 16).

To a 5-L, flanged-top, spherical Morton flask equipped with a supporting clamp (Note 1) are added water (380 mL), thiourea (575 g, 7.53 mol), and 3-chloropropionitrile (500 g, 5.58 mol) (Note 2). The flask is equipped with a three-necked (with thermometer inlet) flanged-top, mechanical stirring rod (600 mm) with Teflon paddle (110 mm), temperature probe, reflux condenser, gas bubbler, and 5-L heating mantle. The reaction mixture is slowly heated to 68\u00b0C over a 30-min period under nitrogen and maintained at 68-70\u00b0C for 1 hr (Note 3). After 1 hr, the temperature of the reaction mixture is increased over a 15-min period to 100\u00b0C and maintained at 100-101\u00b0C for 2 hr (Note 4). After 2 hr, the heating mantle is replaced with a large ice-salt bath, and the reaction mixture is cooled with stirring to 45\u00b0C. When the internal temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 45\u00b0C, stirring is stopped, the cooling process is continued, and the product is allowed to crystallize (Note 5). Cold acetone (2 L) is added and the solid is broken up with a spatula and homogenized (Note 6). The solid is collected using a 160 \u00d7 160-mm medium-fritted funnel and washed with 4 L of cold acetone , stirring with the spatula during the filtration process. The solid is then washed with 2 L of ether and air dried. Final drying in a vacuum oven at room temperature affords 693.7 g (75.0%) of the title compound as a white solid, mp 161.5-162.5\u00b0C (Note 7) and (Note 8). The filtrate is placed in a freezer (4\u00b0C) for two days. The crystallized product is collected by vacuum filtration, washed with ether (2 \u00d7 1 L), air dried, and then dried under vacuum to afford an additional 75.8 g (8.2%) of the title compound, mp 162.5-163.5\u00b0C (Note 9).",
            "B. 2-Cyanoethanethiol (4). To a 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a supporting clamp are added thiouronium salt 3 (369.8 g, 2.23 mol) and water (470 mL) (Note 10). The flask is equipped with a mechanical stirring rod (600 mm) with Teflon paddle (110 mm), temperature probe, gas bubbler, a Teflon tube that extends into the reaction mixture for bubbling nitrogen gas, and a 3-L heating mantle. The reaction mixture is purged with nitrogen by rapidly bubbling nitrogen into the reaction mixture with stirring for 15 min. The Teflon tube is removed, replaced with a 500-mL addition funnel, and then a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 11.25 M, 4.24 mol) is slowly added under a nitrogen atmosphere, keeping the internal temperature below 25\u00b0C (Note 11). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to 45\u00b0C over a 10-min period and held at 45-47\u00b0C for 45 min (Note 12). The heating mantle is removed and replaced with a large ice-salt bath. After the reaction mixture has cooled to 20\u00b0C, a 6 M solution of H2SO4 is slowly added under nitrogen, keeping the internal reaction temperature between 20-25\u00b0C, until the pH of the reaction mixture is 6 (Note 13). With rapid bubbling of nitrogen to maintain a nitrogen atmosphere, the addition funnel is removed and commercial anhydrous ether (500 mL) is added to the reaction mixture. The flask is equipped with a one-hole rubber septum into which a Teflon tube (1 m \u00d7 4-mm id) is inserted. The mixture is stirred for 1 min, and the layers are allowed to separate. The temperature probe is removed and replaced with a rubber septum. Positive nitrogen pressure is applied to transfer the top ether layer using the Teflon tube into a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask with a 24/40 ground glass joint containing magnesium sulfate (MgSO4, 375 g ) and a nitrogen atmosphere, cracking or removing the rubber septum on the thermometer inlet as needed to control the rate of transfer. This extraction process with ether is repeated four times using 500-mL portions. After the combined ether layers are dried over MgSO4 under nitrogen, they are filtered through a sintered glass funnel containing MgSO4 and concentrated using a rotary evaporator to about 500 mL in total volume. The concentrated ether solution is redried over MgSO4 (125 g, under nitrogen), filtered, and concentrated using the rotary evaporator. The product is transferred into a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask and distilled through a short-path jacketed distillation apparatus (Note 14) and (Note 15). A forerun (approximately 5 mL) is collected and discarded. The product distilling at 30-32\u00b0C (0.08-0.12 mm) is collected, providing 106.6 g (55%) of the title compound as a colorless liquid (Note 16),(Note 17),(Note 18),(Note 19)."

Stirring is continued as the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 6), and to the resulting milky suspension is added 31.3 g (141 mmol) of finely powdered 1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)imidazole in one portion (Note 7). After 2 hr, a solution of 18 g (0.45 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 50 mL of water is added over 20 min (Note 8). After 10 min, unreacted 1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)imidazole is separated by filtration through a sintered glass funnel (Note 9). The reaction is quenched by the addition of 48.2 g (0.90 mol) of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) with swirling to dissolve all the solids. The resulting mixture is concentrated to about half of its original volume by blowing a stream of air over its surface overnight (Note 10). The product begins to precipitate almost immediately as the mixture becomes more concentrated. The resulting suspension is filtered through a large sintered-glass funnel (ca. 2 hr), and the collected solid is washed with two 100-mL portions of ice water and one 200-mL portion of acetone and then dried to constant weight over calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator to yield 18 g (40%) (Note 11) of the title compound as a white solid (Note 12)."

            "A. 2,7-Bis(diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene .2 Into a dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser, are added 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene(49.7 g, 0.310 mol , Note 1) and pyridine (700 mL , Note 2) under nitrogen. A dry, 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum is installed and charged with N,N-diethylcarbamoyl chloride (120 mL, 0.900 mol ; Note 3). After the reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath for 30 min, N,N-diethylcarbamoyl chloride is added within 5 min to the vigorously stirred mixture. The ice bath is removed and the dark-brown solution is warmed to room temperature. The dropping funnel is removed under a stream of nitrogen and a thermometer is installed. The solution is heated to 100\u00b0C (\u00b15\u00b0C) for 2 days. TLC indicates a complete reaction (SiO2, 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene, Rf = 0.46; acetone / hexane : 40/60). After the flask is cooled in an ice bath, hydrochloric acid (6 M, 250 mL) is poured into it over 10 min with vigorous stirring. A light-brown solid is formed. The brown mixture is poured into a 3-L Erlenmeyer flask and more hydrochloric acid (6 M, 350 mL) is added, followed by water (600 mL) in order to precipitate the compound further. The solid is filtered with a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with water (500 mL). The crude product is dried under vacuum for several hours until a constant weight is obtained. The purity is found to be sufficient for the subsequent steps (111.0 g, 99% yield; mp 89.0-90.0\u00b0C, Note 4). However, a recrystallization is achieved by dissolving the crude compound in boiling 95% ethanol (300 mL), followed by the addition of water (200 mL). After the flask stands for 8 hr at room temperature, light-brown needles can be collected and washed with a solution of ethanol and water (50:50, 150 mL). The crystals are dried under vacuum to give pure 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene (89.8 g, 0.250 mol, 81% yield; mp 89.6-90.5\u00b0C , Note 5). The filtrate is warmed, water (175 mL) is added, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 8 hr at room temperature to give additional crystals (14.0 g, 0.0391 mol, 13% yield; mp 89.0-90.0\u00b0C). The filtrate is cooled at 5\u00b0C to give a brown solid (5.7 g; mp 83.5-86.5\u00b0C), which is recrystallized from boiling hexanes (120 mL), to give needles of 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene (3.22 g, 8.98 mmol; mp 88.0-89.5\u00b0C). The overall yield is 107 g, 0.299 mol, 97%.",
            "B. 2,7-Dimethylnaphthalene . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet adapter and a 300-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum. All the glassware is oven-dried before assembly. Under a flow of nitrogen, the flask is charged with crystalline 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene (70.3 g; 0.196 mol) , the catalyst NiCl2(dppp)2 (1.90 g; 3.51 mmol, 1.8 mol % relative to 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene, Note 6) and anhydrous diethyl ether (550 mL , Note 7). A red mixture is obtained. The dropping funnel is charged with an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide (3 M in diethyl ether, 235 mL, 0.705 mol , Note 8), which is added dropwise over a period of 25 min. During the addition, the reaction mixture changes from red to pale brown and to green. The mixture is stirred at 30\u00b0C for 13 hr in order to complete the reaction (Note 9). TLC is used to follow the reaction [SiO2, 2,7-bis(diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene, Rf = 0.10; 2,7-dimethylnaphthalene, Rf = 0.74, (hexane/ethyl acetate: 80/20)]. The resulting dark brown mixture is cooled in an ice bath and the dropping funnel is charged with aqueous hydrochloric acid (6 M, 300 mL), which is slowly added to the reaction mixture over 25 min in order to maintain a gentle reflux. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted further with diethyl ether (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with aqueous hydrochloric acid (6 M, 3 \u00d7 100 mL), distilled water (150 mL), brine (200 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration and evaporation of the solvent, the compound is dried under vacuum to a constant weight, to afford a beige solid (30.2 g). The crude product is recrystallized from boiling 95% ethanol (350 mL) to give colorless crystals of 2,7-dimethylnaphthalene (22.1 g). Concentration of the mother liquors and another recrystallization, provides an additional amount of product (5.3 g). 2,7-Dimethylnaphthalene (overall: 27.4 g, 0.175 mol, 89%, mp 95-96\u00b0C , lit.7: mp 95-96\u00b0C, (Note 10) is obtained as fluffy colorless leaflet crystals."

            "A. 2-Hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (1) (Note 1). A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 2) equipped with an internal thermometer and egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer is charged with 150 mL of water (H2O) and 40 g of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This aqueous solution is cooled below 0\u00b0C by immersion in an acetone/ice bath, and 2-amino-5-methylpyridine (18.2 g, 168 mmol) is added (Note 3). The reaction mixture is treated with an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) (15.4 g, 223 mmol in 30 mL of H2O) (Note 4) at a rate sufficient to maintain a reaction temperature of 0-5\u00b0C. After addition of the NaNO2 solution is complete, the resulting mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 45 min, and then heated to 95\u00b0C for 15 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and a 50% w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is added until a pH of 6.5-7.0 is achieved (\u224830 mL) (Note 5). After the reaction mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C, the hot solution is extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (4 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to yield a pale-yellow solid. Purification by recrystallization from hot/cold ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (\u2248300 mL) gives 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (11.2 g, 61%) as white crystalline needles (Note 6).",
            "B. 5-Methyl-2-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)oxypyridine (2). The following procedure for the preparation of the 5-methyl-2-pyridyl triflate may also be used to synthesize the 4- and 6-methyl derivatives. A 200-mL Schlenk flask (Note 2) containing a Teflon-coated, magnetic stirring bar and capped with a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (1) (4.85 g, 44.4 mmol) and dry pyridine (140 mL) (Note 7). After the reactant dissolves, the flask is cooled to \u221212\u00b0C by immersion in an acetone/ice bath. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (15.1 g, 53.5 mmol) (Note 8) is added rapidly to the flask via syringe through the rubber septum. The solution is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 30 min and poured into a separatory funnel containing H2O (150 mL). The mixture is extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (3 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration on a rotary evaporator, followed by flash chromatography on 375 g of deactivated silica gel (Note 9) with 20% EtOAc:80% hexanes, gives 9.89 g (92%) of 5-methyl-2-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)oxypyridine as a clear, colorless oil (Note 10).",
            "C. 5-Methyl-2,2'-bipyridine (3). The 4- and 6-methyl-2,2'-bipyridines may also be prepared using the following procedure. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 2) with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath (\u221278\u00b0C), then 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 11) and tert-butyllithium (tert-BuLi) (1.75 M in pentane, 52 mL, 91.0 mmol) (Note 12) are added to it, followed by dropwise addition of 2-bromopyridine (7.13 g, 4.3 mL, 45.1 mmol) (Note 13). The canary yellow THF solution becomes reddish-brown upon addition of the pyridyl bromide. After the solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 30 min, anhydrous zinc chloride (ZnCl2) (13.3 g, 97.4 mmol) (Note 14) is added, and the reaction is stirred at 25\u00b0C for 2 hr. The 5-methylpyridyl triflate (2) (8.95 g, 37.1 mmol) , lithium choride (LiCl) (3.18 g, 75.2 mmol) (Note 15), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (Pd(PPh3)4) (1.75 g, 1.5 mmol) (Note 16) are then added. The brownish-yellow reaction mixture is heated at reflux (Note 17) for 18 hr. After the solution is cooled, an aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (55 g, 148 mmol in 400 mL) (Note 18) is added and the pH is adjusted to \u22488 with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The solution is stirred for 15 min then poured into a separatory funnel. The product is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 , filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Flash chromatography on 275 g of deactivated silica gel (Note 9) ( 20% EtOAc:80% hexanes) affords 5.94 g (94%) of 5-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine as a very pale yellow oil (Note 19)."

The reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 16 hr (Note 10). The reaction flask is again cooled in an ice/H2O bath prior to the addition of 200 mL of toluene . Excess DIBAL-H is quenched by the cautious dropwise addition of 20 mL of 3 M aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. When gas evolution ceases, 350 mL of 3 M aqueous KOH is added in one portion and the two-phase mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel (Notes 11, 12). The phases are separated and chipped ice is added to the aqueous phase, which is further extracted with ice-cold CHCl3(12 \u00d7 150 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed by rotary evaporation to afford 6.19 g of white crystalline solid. Sublimation (0.05 mm, 90\u00b0C) of this material gives 5.44 g (58%) of product 2 (>98% purity by NMR; Notes 13, 14, 15)."

A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1), equipped with a nitrogen inlet, magnetic stirrer, and rubber septum is charged with tetrahydrofuran (THF) (90 mL) (Note 2) and diisopropylamine (9.8 mL, 69.7 mmol) (Note 3). The reaction mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and a solution of butyllithium (n-BuLi) (1.7 M in hexanes, 36.0 mL, 61.4 mmol) (Note 4) is added. The solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 10 min, warmed to 0\u00b0C and stirred for 10 min, then cooled back to \u221278\u00b0C. A solution of 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (5.14 g, 27.9 mmol) (Note 5) in THF (130 mL) (Note 2), prepared in a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere, is added via cannula to the cold lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution. The resulting maroon-black reaction mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 1 hr, then chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) (8.85 mL, 69.7 mmol) (Note 6) is rapidly added via syringe. After the solution becomes pale blue-green (\u224810 sec after the TMSCl addition), the reaction is quenched by rapid addition of absolute ethanol (10 mL). (Note: the reaction should be quenched regardless of color change after a maximum of 15 seconds to avoid over silylation). The cold reaction mixture is poured into a separatory funnel (1 L) containing aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, \u2248200 mL) and allowed to warm to \u224825\u00b0C. The product is extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 3 \u00d7 300 mL); the combined organic fractions are shaken with brine (\u2248200 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Filtration and concentration on a rotary evaporator affords 8.85 g (97%) of 4,4'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2,2'-bipyridine as a slightly off-white crystalline solid (Note 7).",

The flask is charged with 15 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 2) and 5.8 mL (28 mmol, 2.5 equiv) of hexamethyldisilazane (Note 3). After the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath, 9.4 mL (23.5 mmol, 2.1 equiv) of a solution of butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes) (Note 4) is added slowly via a syringe to the stirred solution. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. After the solution is stirred for 30 min, it is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C using an acetone-dry ice bath and equilibrated for 5 min at the same temperature. Then 1.00 g (11.2 mmol, 1 equiv) of ethyl [2-13C]acetate (Note 5) is added within 5 min via a syringe, and the acetate-containing flask is rinsed with 0.5 mL of anhydrous THF. Stirring is continued at \u221278\u00b0C for 20 min, and 1.07 mL (11.2 mmol, 1 equiv) of ethyl chloroformate (Note 6) is added within 5 min via a syringe. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, and 5 mL of 6 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added in one portion (Note 7). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, and after the addition of 20 mL of water, the pH of the solution is adjusted to 1-2 with 2 M HCl. The mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed successively with 2 M HCl, water, and brine (30 mL each). The HCl and water phases are combined and reextracted with ether (50 mL). The organic layer is washed with brine (20 mL) and added to the combined organic phases. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (200 mbar/35\u00b0C, 150 mm/35\u00b0C). The crude product is distilled in a microdistillation apparatus at 90 mbar (67.5 mm) to give 1.66 g(10.3 mmol, 92%) of diethyl [2-13C]malonate as a colorless liquid (Notes 8 and 9).",

The condenser is sealed with a silica gel drying tube, and the stirred solution is put in an oil bath at 105\u00b0C. A solution of 0.22 g (2.0 mmol, 0.2 equiv) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 13) in 20 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) is added dropwise via the funnel during 20 min; the mixture turns red and turbid. After the mixture is heated under reflux for 15 hr, it is allowed to cool to room temperature. Water (30 mL) is added, followed by 5 mL of 2 M HCl. After removal of most of the solvent with a rotary evaporator, the aqueous mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water and brine (each 30 mL). Drying over Na2SO4, filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator affords the crude product.

Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.5 mL) is added dropwise within 30 sec (Note 3) with shaking. The mixture is mechanically shaken for 40 min (Note 4) and then left for 3 days at room temperature. Ethanol (300 mL, Note 5) is added to the adhesive, colorless mass, then the pH is adjusted to 6.5-7 (Note 6) by addition of a 1 N solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol (Note 7). The residue is dissolved by careful heating. During this procedure the pH is maintained constant by gradual addition of more 1 N ethanolic potassium hydroxide . Charcoal (5 g, Note 8) is added to the yellow solution and the mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel containing a 2-cm pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with hot ethanol (50 mL). The filtrate, on standing overnight in a freezer at \u221230\u00b0C, deposits a colorless solid material that is recrystallized from ethanol (90 mL) at \u221230\u00b0C (Note 9) to yield 39.4 g (42%) of (\u2212)-4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose .

The addition funnel is removed and replaced by a rubber septum, and the reaction is assayed by 1H NMR (Notes 5, 6).\nWhile the reaction is aging at 0\u00b0 to +5\u00b0C, a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for mechanical stirring, and outfitted with a rubber septum, and a Claisen adapter bearing a thermometer and a nitrogen inlet/outlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 117 mL of 6% aqueous ammonium chloride (7.0 g diluted to 117 mL) (Note 1). The solution is chilled to 1 to 2\u00b0C, with efficient mechanical stirring. When the formation of dimethyltitanocene is judged to be complete, the toluene /THF reaction mixture is quenched into (Note 7) the well-stirred aqueous ammonium chloride solution via a cannula (Note 8) over a period of 1 hr, maintaining an internal temperature of 0\u00b0 to +5\u00b0C in both flasks. Toluene (30 mL) is used to rinse the reaction flask. The biphasic mixture is then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel, with another 30 mL of toluene rinse, and the aqueous phase is separated (Note 9). The organic layer is washed sequentially with three portions of cold water (100 mL each) and brine (100 mL), then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 35 g). The organic layer is filtered and carefully (Note 10) concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of no more than 35\u00b0C to a weight of 150 g. The resulting orange solution is assayed by 1H NMR (Note 11) to be 20 weight percent dimethyltitanocene (29.55 g, 85.0%). If the solution is to be stored for more than a week, the reagent should be diluted with 160 mL of dry THF (Note 2), which has a stabilizing effect on the labile reagent (Note 12). The solution is stored at 0\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C under nitrogen in a rubber septum-sealed, round-bottomed flask. It proved effective in the conversion of a complex ester to an enol ether (Note 13)."

            "A. Indium(III) iodide . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added xylenes (500 mL). The solvent is degassed (Note 1) and the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser. Indium powder (5.00 g, 43.6 mmol) (Note 2) is added to the vigorously stirring solution, followed by iodine (I2, 16.57 g, 65.32 mmol). The mixture is stirred vigorously (Note 3) and heated at reflux (bath temp. \u2248160-170\u00b0C) under argon for 1-1.5 hr or until the indium metal is consumed. When the metal is consumed, a crystal of iodine is added and stirring at reflux is resumed. The reaction is complete when the added iodine is not consumed after 15 min at reflux. The solution is filtered hot and allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 4). The resulting bright yellow crystals are filtered under nitrogen using a Schlenk filtration system (Note 5) and washed with two 10-mL portions of cold benzene to remove traces of I2. The filtrate is concentrated to 1/4-1/3 volume (Note 6) and cooled to 0\u00b0C. The yellow precipitate is Schlenk-filtered under nitrogen and washed with cold benzene (10 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure to yield 18.3 g (85%) of indium(III) iodide [In(III)I] (Note 7).",
            "B. Indium(I) iodide . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added xylenes (400 mL).

Indium(III) iodide (18.30 g, 36.93 mmol) is added to the flask, and the mixture is stirred vigorously while indium powder (2.12 g, 18.46 mmol) (Note 2) is added. The mixture is stirred vigorously (Note 3) at reflux under argon for 18 hr. The resulting yellow suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with ether (400-500 mL) and stirred for 1 hr. The resulting burgundy precipitate is filtered under air and washed with ether (100 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure to yield 6.14 g (92%) of indium(I) iodide . The filtrate is concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, venting with nitrogen, to yield 14.4 g (105% based on eq B.) (Note 8) of recovered indium(III) iodide (Note 9).",
            "C. (R)-3-(tert-Butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal . A 500-mL, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 10.00 g (84.67 mmol) of methyl (R)-(\u2212)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate (Note 10), and 100 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 11). The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and 14.4 g (211 mmol) of imidazole is added. Upon dissolution of the imidazole, 23.1 mL (88.9 mmol) of tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane (DPSCl) (Note 12) is added dropwise via syringe. After 10 min, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction is quenched by the addition of 200 mL of pentane and 40 mL of water (H2O). The layers are separated and the pentane layer is washed with brine (75 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with pentane (3 \u00d7 75 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure followed by purification by flash chromatography (Note 13) yield 29.9 g (99%) of methyl (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropionate as a clear oil (Note 14).\nA 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 9.92 g (27.9 mmol) of methyl (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropionate and 200 mL of dry hexanes (Note 15).

After the addition is complete, the resultant solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 2 hr. The reaction is quenched by pouring the cold solution into 250 mL of saturated aqueous Rochelle's salt. Ether (300 mL) and H2O (75 mL) are added and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hr (Note 17). The layers are separated and the ether layer is washed with brine. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and the combined extracts are dried over Na2SO4 . Filtration of the solution and concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure followed by purification of the crude product by flash chromatography (Note 18) yields 7.85 g (86%) of (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal as a white solid (Note 19).",
            "D. (R)-3-Butyn-2-yl methanesulfonate . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 713 mL) and (R)-(+)-3-butyn-2-ol (10.00 g, 143 mmol) (Note 20). The mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and triethylamine (Et3N, 39.7 mL, 285 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (16.6 mL, 214 mmol) are added. The resulting mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 1 hr, then quenched with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution and allowed to warm to room temperature. The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with brine and concentrated under aspirator pressure (Note 21). The residue is diluted with 500 mL of ether and washed with water (20 mL) followed by brine (20 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (50 mL). The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under aspirator pressure to yield 20.13 g (95%) of the methanesulfonate (Note 22). The material is used without further purification (Note 23).",
            "E. (2R,3S,4S)-1-(tert-Butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2,4-dimethyl-5-hexyn-3-ol . An oven-dried, 100-mL, one-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is purged with argon. The flask is charged with (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal (3.00 g, 9.19 mmol) and the (R)-methanesulfonate (1.50 g, 10.1 mmol). Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 29.4 mL) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA, 7.4 mL) are added via syringe. To the solution is added PdCl2(dppf) (335 mg, 0.46 mmol) (Note 24), immediately followed by indium(I) iodide (2.66 g, 11.0 mmol). The resultant dark suspension is stirred vigorously for 1 hr at which time the reaction is judged complete by TLC (Note 25). The reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of H2O (30 mL), and ether (20 mL) is added. After being stirred for 2 min the layers are separated and the ether layer is washed with brine. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 25 mL) and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 . Filtration of the solution and concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure followed by purification of the crude product by flash chromatography on silica gel (Note 26) provide 2.64 g (76%) of (2R,3S,4S)-1-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2,4-dimethyl-5-hexyn-3-ol (Note 27) as a clear oil and 201 mg of the (2R,3R,4R) diastereomer (Note 28)."

To the flask are added 3.86 g (3.90 mL, 40.2 mmol) of 2-cyclohexenone (Note 6), 200 mL of 1,4-dioxane (Note 7), and 20 mL of water via syringe, and the entire orange mixture is immersed in a oil bath preheated to 120\u00b0C and heated at 105\u00b0C for 3 hr. After the solvent is cooled to room temperature, it is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. After concentration of the initial reaction mixture on a rotary evaporator, the residue is dissolved in diethyl ether (100 mL). The resulting solution is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and washed with 1.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl, 100 mL) followed by 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (100 mL). The aqueous washes are separately extracted with diethyl ether (30 mL each). The ether layers are combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , filtered, and the filtrate concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil. The oil is filtered through silica (200 mL) with hexanes (500 mL) followed by diethyl ether (400 mL) on a 4-cm \u03c6 column. Fractions of eluent (20 mL) are collected and those containing the product as determined by TLC are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil that is distilled under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) to give 5.77 g (83% yield) of (R)-3-phenylcyclohexanone (1) (Note 8) as a colorless oil. The enantiomeric purity is 98.6% ee, which is determined by HPLC analysis using a chiral stationary phase column (Note 9).",
            "Method B. A dry, 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and a reflux condenser attached to a gas-flow adapter with a stopcock, is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 3.95 g (25.2 mmol) of bromobenzene (Note 10) and 12.5 mL of dry diethyl ether (Note 11) via syringe, and cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice-water bath. At this temperature, 16.7 mL (25.1 mmol) of a 1.50 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane (Note 12) is added. The ice-water bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath, and 2.59 g (24.9 mmol) of trimethoxyborane (Note 13) is added dropwise over a period of 10 min via syringe. The mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 30 min and slowly warmed to room temperature by removal of the dry ice-acetone bath. In a second flask, a 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and a gas-flow adapter with a stopcock, are placed 74.7 mg (0.120 mmol) of (R)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl [(R)-BINAP] (Notes 3, 4), and 25.8 mg (0.100 mmol) of acetylacetonatobis(ethylene)rhodium(I) (Note 5). After the flask is flushed with nitrogen, 50 mL of 1,4-dioxane is added via syringe, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 10 min. To the first flask containing the phenylborate reagent, Lithium phenyltrimethoxyborate , are added successively, via syringe 0.975 g (10.1 mmol) of 2-cyclohexenone (Note 6), 0.54 mL of water, and the catalyst solution from the second flask. The entire mixture is heated in an oil bath at 100\u00b0C for 12 hr. After the solvent is cooled to room temperature, it is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The dark brown residue is diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL) and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The ether solution is washed with 10% hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide (100 mL). The aqueous layers are extracted with diethyl ether (30 mL each). The organic layers are combined, washed with aqueous saturated sodium chloride (100 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solvent is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil, which is dissolved in 5 mL of diethyl ether and chromatographed on silica gel [4 cm \u03a6, 200 mL of silica gel (Note 14)]. Elution with 500 mL of hexane (Note 15) followed by elution with 400 mL of diethyl ether gives crude 3-phenylcyclohexanone (1), collected as 20-mL fractions and combined. Distillation under reduced pressure (bp 125-130\u00b0C at 0.5 mm) gives 1.55 g (88.1% yield) of (R)-3-phenylcyclohexanone (1) (Note 8) as a colorless oil.

Stirring is started and the following reagents are added in the order indicated through a powder funnel: potassium ferricyanide (247 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), anhydrous potassium carbonate (104 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), methanesulfonamide (23.8 g, 0.25 mol, 1 equiv), potassium osmate dihydrate (46.1 mg, 0.125 mmol, 0.05 mol %), (DHQD)2PHAL [1,4-bis(9-O-dihydroquinidinyl)phthalazine, 486.9 mg, 0.625 mmol, 0.25 mol %], 1-phenylcyclohexene (1, 39.55 g, 0.25 mol) and tert-butyl alcohol (250 mL) (Notes 1 and 2). The slurry is stirred vigorously for 2 days at a rate of 500 rpm. During this time, the product crystallizes in the top organic phase, beginning after 4 hr. Also, the appearance of the slurry gradually changes from a mixture containing red granules (ferricyanide) to yellow flakes, which are presumably a salt of iron(II).\nAfter the reaction is complete the mixture is treated with ethyl acetate (250 mL) with stirring to dissolve the product. The resulting mixture is filtered through a 500-mL medium-fritted glass funnel and the flask and filter cake are washed with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the brown-colored aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is washed with 2 M potassium hydroxide (KOH, 2 \u00d7 50 mL) with vigorous shaking to remove methanesulfonamide , then dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4, 12.5 g). The solid is filtered, the cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 37 mL) and the filtrate is evaporated, to afford a white solid. After the crude product is dried under reduced pressure overnight, it weighs 47.44 g (99%) (Notes 3 and 4).",
            "B. (\u2212)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-Phenyl-1-cyclohexanol (3). A 1-L, three-necked flask is set up with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and nitrogen line. The flask is placed in a silicone oil bath (230 \u00d7 100-mm Schott crystallizing dish). The flask is charged with a slurry containing activated W-2 Raney nickel (257.5 g) in wet ethanol (70% v/v) through a powder funnel under a blanket of nitrogen. Caution-Fire Hazard! Raney nickel is extremely pyrophoric when dry and must be kept submerged under liquid at all times (Note 5). This is done by transferring an aqueous slurry of Raney nickel to the flask with the aid of 250 mL of anhydrous ethanol in portions, making sure that the catalyst does not dry. The crude diol from the previous step is added to the flask, using another 50 mL of anhydrous ethanol to complete the transfer. The mixture is stirred vigorously and refluxed for 2 hr (Note 6).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 40-50\u00b0C and filtered through a 1/2\"-layer of Celite in a 500-mL fritted (medium) glass funnel, making sure that the liquid level does not fall below the surface of the filter cake. A total of 300 mL of ethanol in small portions is used to transfer the slurry quantitatively to the funnel and to wash the filter cake. A 170-mm \u00d7 90-mm crystallizing dish is useful to cover the top of funnel during the filtration; however it is not necessary. The Raney nickel sludge is transferred with water to a waste container.\nThe filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove most of the ethanol and the resulting two-phase mixture is diluted with 50 mL of saturated brine and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic phase is dried over MgSO4 (3.75 g), filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure overnight to give the crude alcohol (35.53 g, 94.0% ee). The solid residue is crystallized from 75 mL of warm petroleum ether (bp 30-60\u00b0C). The crystallization is allowed to proceed for 3 hr at room temperature and 1 hr at 0\u00b0C. The crystalline mass is triturated with 25 mL of cold (0\u00b0C) pentane to break up the lumps. The slurry is filtered, washed with chilled pentane in portions (3 \u00d7 12.5 mL) and the solid is dried under reduced pressure overnight to constant weight, to afford 25.12 g (58% from 1) of colorless crystals, mp 64-65\u00b0C. The enantiomeric purity was found to be >99.5% ee by chiral stationary phase SFC (supercritical-fluid chromatography) (Notes 7-8)."

A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 10-mL Dean-Stark trap, and reflux condenser is charged with d-menthol (51.9 g, 0.330 mol), 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (37.3 g, 0.370 mol), D-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid (3.96 g, 0.170 mol), and 190 mL of dry benzene (Note 8). The stirred suspension is heated to reflux under argon with an oil bath preheated to 100\u00b0C (Note 9). After 1-2 hr, a total of 5.1 mL of water is collected and no residual menthol is apparent by TLC analysis (Note 10). The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and treated carefully with 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. After completion of the addition, stirring is maintained for 90 min as the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The product is extracted with dichloromethane (300 mL) and the organic phase is washed with three 70-mL portions of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide 66.7 g (85%) of a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the menthyloxybutenolides (Note 11). This mixture is dissolved in 400 mL of hot petroleum ether (bp 35-60\u00b0C) and subsequently cooled to room temperature and eventually to \u221210\u00b0C (Note 12). Two additional recrystallizations from petroleum ether (200 mL on each occasion) with slow cooling affords 10.7-17.33 g (14-22%) of pure (5S)-(d-menthyloxy)-2(5H)-furanone, mp 79-80\u00b0C (Note 13).",
            "C. Acid-catalyzed epimerization. The combined mother liquors from Step B are concentrated to dryness, dissolved in 50 mL of benzene, and concentrated again under reduced pressure. The resulting solid is dissolved in 150 mL of dichloromethane, treated with D-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid (2.0 g, 8.6 mmol) and the mixture is heated to reflux under argon with magnetic stirring for 19 hr. The resulting solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (40 mL) is carefully added. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 20\u00b0C. The organic phase is separated and washed with two 50-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is crystallized three times from petroleum ether as described in Step B to give an additional 13.04-17.60 g (17-22%) of furanone.

            "A. Methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate. To a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser and addition funnel, is added methyl 2-methyl-3-nitrobenzoate (19.1 g, 97.9 mmol, (Note 1)), dibenzoyl peroxide (1.21 g, 5.00 mmol, (Note 2)), and 100 mL of carbon tetrachloride (Note 3). The mixture is heated to reflux, and a clear, pale yellow solution is formed. A solution of bromine (16.1 g, 100.6 mmol) (Note 2) in 20 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added over 10 min to the boiling solution under irradiation using a 100-W flood lamp. The reaction mixture is heated and irradiated for 24 hr. The resulting orange solution is allowed to cool to ambient temperature; 50 mL of dichloromethane is added, and the solution is washed with three 50-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase is dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator affording 25.90 g (96.5%) of methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate as pale yellow crystals. The material is used in the next step without further purification (Note 4).",
            "B. (2-Carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide. To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is added methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate (25.90 g, 94.5 mmol) and 150 mL of chloroform (Note 5). Triphenylphosphine (28.44 g, 108.4 mmol) (Note 2) is added in one portion and the resulting yellow solution is heated to reflux for 1.5 hr. After cooling to ambient temperature, the orange solution is poured into 400 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 6) with vigorous stirring to precipitate the Wittig salt. The slurry is cooled in a freezer (\u221220\u00b0C, 1 hr). The white solids are collected by filtration, washed with 4 \u00d7 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether, and dried under high-vacuum to give crude (2-carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide. A 1H NMR spectrum indicated that the product contained some triphenylphosphine, thus the salt was washed again with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying, a considerably purer product (50.91 g) was obtained. The salt is used in the next step without further purification (Note 7).",
            "C. Methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate.Paraformaldehyde (30 g) (Note 8) is placed in a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask. An argon inlet is connected to one of the necks. The other neck is connected to a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask via Tygon tubing (2 cm id) and two male 24/40 joints (Note 9). In the 1-L flask, 2-carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (50.91 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of dichloromethane. A glass tube is attached to the Tygon tubing such that the end extends several cm into the solution. Triethylamine (39.13 g, 53.8 mL, 386.7 mmol) is added to the 1-L flask, resulting in the immediate formation of a deep blue/purple solution; a condenser is attached to the second neck of the flask. Argon is then passed over the paraformaldehyde so that a steady stream of gas is constantly bubbling through the purple ylide solution. The paraformaldehyde is heated to 160\u00b0C (oil bath) in order to generate formaldehyde, which flows through the solution (Note 10). Upon completion of the addition of formaldehyde, the purple color of the ylide slowly changes from deep purple to brown over a period of 1-2 hr, indicating completion of the reaction. The resulting solution is poured into 500 mL of hexanes, forming a precipitate, which is removed by filtration. The precipitate is washed with 100 mL of hexanes and the combined filtrate and wash are concentrated at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator. The crude yellow-brown solid is dissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane; 30 g of silica gel is added and the mixture is concentrated again. The resulting powder applied to a pre-packed silica gel column (40 \u00d7 4 cm) (Note 11), and eluted with 7:3 hexanes:ethyl acetate to give methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate (15.87 g, 76.6 mmol, 81%, Notes 12-14) as pale yellow crystals.",
            "D. Caution! Due to the toxicity of carbon monoxide and the risk of an explosion in handling pressurized glassware, this transformation should be carried out in a well vented fume hood with a blast shield and the hood sash down. Users should exercise appropriate caution at all times.\nMethyl indole-4-carboxylate. To a threaded glass, 200-mL reaction vessel, equipped with a Teflon stirring bar, is added methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate (10.35 g, 50.0 mmol), triphenylphosphine (3.23 g, 12.3 mmol) and 100 mL of acetonitrile (Note 15). The mixture is stirred for 10 min to dissolve the reagents. Palladium acetate (0.673 g, 3.00 mmol) (Note 16) is added; a yellow precipitate is immediately formed. The tube is attached to a pressure head (Note 17) and the solution is saturated with carbon monoxide (four cycles to 59 psi of CO) (Note 18). The reaction mixture is heated to 90\u00b0C (oil bath temperature) under CO (59 psi) for 50 hr. A red-brown solution forms after heating for a few minutes. In order to remove carbon dioxide that is formed and to monitor the progress of the reaction, the vessel is removed from the oil bath for 15 min, carefully vented, and repressurized with CO every 10-12 hr (Note 19). After 50 hr, the reaction mixture is cooled and concentrated using a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure, giving a dark brown/black oil. The crude product is purified by chromatography on a pre-packed 40 \u00d7 4 cm silica column (Note 11) using 7:3 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (0.80 L), then 1:1 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (2.80 L) as eluents affording methyl indole-4-carboxylate (7.95 g, 44.75 mmol, 91%) as a pale yellow solid (Note 20)."

An apparatus, consisting of a 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, reflux condenser connected to a vacuum/N2 line, inlet tube sealed with a rubber septum, and magnetic stirring bar, is evacuated, then flushed with nitrogen. This cycle is repeated four times. The apparatus is flame-dried under a flow of nitrogen, then cooled to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Carbonyldihydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II), RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3, (0.918 g, 1.00 mmol, 0.010 eq) (Notes 2, 3) is placed in the flask under a slow flow of nitrogen. Addition of 20 mL of toluene (Note 4) to the flask affords a suspension of white solids (Note 5). To this suspension are added triethoxyvinylsilane (20.93 g, 110 mmol, 1.10 eq) (Notes 6, 7), then 1-tetralone (14.62 g, 100 mmol, 1.00 eq) (Notes 6, 8) at room temperature through the rubber septum using a syringe. The resulting mixture containing the white solids is heated to reflux in an oil bath (oil bath temperature: 135\u00b0C) (Notes 9, 10). The reaction mixture becomes colorless within 1 min, then changes to a dark wine red color within 5 min (Note 11). After heating for 30 min, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. About half of the reaction mixture is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask (Note 12) for concentration and distillation. Volatile materials (toluene and triethoxyvinylsilane) are removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (2 mm) at 40\u00b0C. After almost all volatile materials are removed, the other half of the reaction mixture is transferred to the flask. The reaction vessel is rinsed with two 5-mL portions of toluene, then the rinses are transferred to the distillation flask. The combined reaction mixture and rinses are concentrated. Solvent and vinylsilane are removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (2 mm at 40\u00b0C) (Note 13). Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 31-32.5 g (92-96%) of 8-[2-(triethoxysilyl)ethyl]-1-tetralone as a pale yellow liquid, bp 133-135\u00b0C/0.2 mm (Notes 14-18)."

After separation of water ceases, the reaction mixture is partitioned between hexane (500 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (200 mL). The organic phase is washed with water (100 mL) and saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) (100 mL), dried over magnesium chloride (MgSO4), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue yields, after about 5 g of forerun, 249 g (97%) of the acetal 1 as a colorless oil (bp 99-100\u00b0C, 3.5 mm) (Note 2).",
            "B. 1,6,6-Trimethyl-4,8-dioxaspiro[2.5]oct-1-ene (3) (Note 3). A solution of sodium amide in liquid ammonia is prepared according to a procedure previously described (Notes 4, 5). An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen gas inlet, and dry ice/acetone condenser protected with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets. The flask is flushed with nitrogen introduced through the gas inlet, then is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath. The nitrogen source is replaced with a hose connected to a cylinder of ammonia (NH3). Gaseous NH3 is introduced to the flask condensing ca. 400 mL of NH3 and gentle stirring is started. The NH3 inlet is replaced with a glass stopper and the dry ice/acetone bath is replaced with a \u221235\u00b0C bath (electronically controlled or a dry ice/trichloroethylene bath). Crystals of Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (0.3 g) are added through the neck having a stopper. To the resulting orange solution is added a small (about 5 mm3) cube of sodium. The solution is stirred (Note 6) until the blue color disappears and fine black particles appear. Pieces of sodium (21.44 g, 0.930 mol) are then added over 35 min. After 20 min, the solution turns into a dark gray suspension with a white precipitate. The cooling bath is replaced with a dry ice/acetone bath, and the gas inlet is replaced with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of 2,2-bis-(chloromethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane 1 (63.93 g, 0.300 mol) in 150 mL of dry ether (Et2O). This solution is added dropwise to the slurry of sodium amide in liquid NH3 over 1 hr. The addition funnel is rinsed with 20 mL of dry Et2O. The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 3 hr (Note 7), then is cooled again with a dry ice/acetone bath. After 10 min, a solution of freshly distilled iodomethane (44.71 g, 0.315 mol) in 80 mL of dry Et2O is added via the addition funnel over 1 hr (Notes 8, 9); the funnel is rinsed with 20 mL of dry Et2O. After stirring for 15 min, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 1 hr. The mixture is cooled with a dry ice/acetone bath again and solid ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (20.24 g, 0.378 mol) is added in several portions over 5 min. The dry ice condenser is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The cooling bath is replaced with a water bath (ca. 30\u00b0C), and a 1:1 mixture of dry Et2O and dry pentane (400 mL) is added through the addition funnel over 10 min with vigorous stirring. The water bath temperature is maintained between 25-30\u00b0C. After evaporation of most of the ammonia (1.5 to 2 hr), the ethereal solution is filtered by suction through a pad of Hyflo Super Cel to remove the inorganic salts. The filter cake is washed three times with 80 mL of Et2O. The combined filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (30-40 mm, 25\u00b0C) (Note 10) and the residue is distilled to yield 3 as a colorless oil (32.3 g, 70%; bp 58-61\u00b0C, 6-7 mm) (Notes 11-14). While this material is adequate for use in Step C, a pure sample can be obtained by flash chromatography of the crude product followed by distillation. For 36.1 g of crude product (obtained on a 0.25 mol scale), chromatography is performed with 290 g of silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60) and Et2O:pentane (5:95) as eluent, collecting 160-mL fractions. Fractions 3-16 containing the product are combined. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure followed by vacuum distillation afforded 29.3 g of 3 in 76% yield (99% pure by GC).",

An oven-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and three-way stopcock, which is connected to a vacuum/nitrogen line, is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is placed in a plastic bag filled with nitrogen, and powdered potassium tert-butoxide (1.32 g, 11.8 mmol) (Note 15) is introduced quickly. The flask is connected to a nitrogen source, tert-butyl alcohol (7.11 g, 96 mmol) and 40 mL of Et2O (Note 16) are introduced by syringe, and the solution is stirred for 10 min at room temperature.\nAn oven-dried 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and three-way stopcock, connected to a vacuum/nitrogen line, is charged with 1,6,6-trimethyl-4,8-dioxaspiro[2.5]oct-1-ene (3) (46.3 g, 0.30 mol) under nitrogen. Ether (100 mL) is introduced via syringe, and the solution is stirred with external cooling at \u221278\u00b0C (dry ice/acetone bath). The solution of potassium tert-butoxide is added to this solution through a 1.5 mm i.d. cannula over 5 min. After stirring for 5 min at this temperature, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 17). After stirring for 4 hr (Note 18), 15 mL of 1N HCl is added in one portion. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel with the aid of 30 mL of Et2O, and the aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is washed successively with 5 mL each of saturated NaHCO3 and saturated NaCl, and is dried over Na2SO4. After concentration on a rotary evaporator, a pale yellow oil is obtained. Distillation under reduced pressure (Note 19) (57-59\u00b0C,7.3 mm) affords 36.49 g (79% yield) of 5 (Notes 19, 20) after ca. 1.5 g of a forerun.

The mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice bath (Note 2) and 12.5 mL (3.73 g, 0.11 mol) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Note 3) is added dropwise over a period of 15 min through an addition funnel. After completion of the addition, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 hr. Diphenyl disulfide is sparingly soluble in trifluoroethanol and precipitates out of solution. The solids are collected on a Buchner funnel and dried under vacuum to afford 10.6 g of diphenyl disulfide (97%) (Note 4). Sodium sulfite 2.52 g (0.02 mol) is added to the mother liquor to decompose the excess peroxide and the mixture is heated in a water bath at 50\u00b0C for 30 min. A starch iodide test is negative. The liquid is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a distillation unit having a Vigreux column (5 cm). The flask is heated in an oil bath and the solvent is distilled to recover the trifluoroethanol (Note 5).\nMethyl phenyl sulfoxide.

A solution of the material obtained in Step A in 100 mL of heptane (Notes 6, 7) is added under nitrogen to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Thirty-four grams (0.31 mol) of 1,4-benzoquinone is added (Notes 8, 9), and the mixture is heated with an oil bath at 120\u00b0C for 3.5 days with stirring (Note 10). The reaction mixture is then cooled to 25\u00b0C and 25 mL of CH2Cl2 is added. The solids are broken into small pieces with the aid of a spatula, and the mixture is shaken for 15 min with 50 g of sand (Note 11). The supernatant liquid is decanted, the residue is extracted three times with 70-mL portions of 1:1 hexane:CH2Cl2, and the combined extracts are filtered through a pad of Celite. The solution is concentrated, and 1,4-benzoquinone is removed by sublimation by heating the residue to 100\u00b0C and applying a vacuum of ca. 0.5 torr. Methanol (MeOH, 100 mL) and ca. 20 g of sand are added, and the mixture is shaken until the solids are finely suspended (ca. 30 min). Water (20 mL) is added and the mixture is shaken for 10 min. The solids are collected by filtration and washed with ca. 250 mL of 5:1 MeOH:H2O.
