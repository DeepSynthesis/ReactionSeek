            "A. ((tert-Butoxycarbonyl)glycyl)(pyridin-1-ium-1-yl)amide (2). A 500 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3 cm stirrer bar and a needle-pierced septum is charged with methyl (tert-butoxycarbonyl)-glycinate 1 (Note 2) (6.80 g, 36.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) and methanol (Note 3) (225 mL). 1-Amino pyridinium iodide (Note 4) (6.67 g, 30.0 mmol) is added and the reaction is stirred for 5 min at 22 \u00b0C. Potassium carbonate (Note 5) (9.95 g, 72.0 mmol, 2.40 equiv) is added and the reaction is stirred at 22 \u00b0C for 64 h (Note 6) (the yellow heterogeneous reaction turns colorless two seconds after the addition of potassium carbonate, and forms a dark purple solution, Figure 1). After removal of the stir bar, 200 mL of the methanol is removed under reduced pressure (200 mmHg to 70 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a brown-purple syrup, which is poured onto an alumina pad (Notes 7 and 8).\nFigure 1. Change in reaction color: a) Reaction mixture before potassium carbonate addition; b) Reaction mixture 10 seconds after potassium carbonate addition; c) Reaction mixture after 64 h\nThe flask is rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane as well as 50 mL of eluent (dichloromethane-methanol, 9:1), and the product is eluted with 1.1 L of dichloromethane-methanol (9:1) (Note 9). The filtrate is concentrated (375 mmHg to 75 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then transferred to a 500 mL single-necked round-bottomed flask and rinsed with dichloromethane (20 mL). The filtrate is concentrated further (375 mmHg to 15 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then dried under vacuum (0.08 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C, 1 h) to give a brown powder (Note 10). A 3 cm Teflon coated stirrer bar is added, followed by acetone (175 mL) (Note 11). A water-cooled condenser is added to the flask and the mixture is heated to reflux until complete dissolution had occurred (15 min). The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature over 3 h and then cooled to -22 \u00b0C in a freezer for 20 h. The resultant fine brown crystals are filtered off through a sintered S3 funnel, the flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (Note 12) (3 x 25 mL), and the contents were then added to the funnel.\nFigure 2. Compound 2 after recrystallization from acetone\nThe powder is transferred to a 50 mL single-necked flask and dried under static vacuum (0.12 mmHg, 18 h) (6.39 g, 85%, 98% purity) (Figure 2) (Notes 13, 14, and 15).",
            "B. tert-Butyl ((4-((N-benzyl-4-methylphenyl)sulfonamido)-5-phenyloxazol-2-yl)methyl)carbamate (4). A three-necked 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum, a glass stopper, a vacuum tap and 2 cm Teflon coated stirrer bar is flame-dried under vacuum (0.12 mmHg) for 1 min and then backfilled with nitrogen. The evacuation/nitrogen purge is repeated a total of 3 times, and then the reaction vessel is allowed to cool to room temperature (22 \u00b0C) under a positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is sequentially charged with N-benzyl-4-methyl-N-(phenylethynyl)benzene-sulfonamide (Note 16) (4.69 g, 13.0 mmol), dichloro(2-pyridinecarboxylato)gold (Note 17) (51.02 mg, 0.13 mmol) and ((tert-butoxycarbonyl)glycyl)(pyridin-1-ium-1-yl)amide (3.60 g, 14.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv). Toluene (130 mL) (Note 18) is added and the flask is placed in a preheated aluminium mantle and stirred at 90 \u00b0C (controlled by an external probe) for 5.5 h (Note 19). The heterogeneous mixture becomes a homogenous orange-brown solution over the first hour (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. a) Reaction set-up for Step B; b) Reaction progress monitored by TLC. From left to right: Compound 3, control spot and reaction mixture\nUpon completion, the flask is removed from the heating mantle and the reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature for 1 h. The crude reaction mixture is filtered through a silica pad (Note 20) and then the reaction flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL) (Note 21), which is then added to the silica pad. The pad is then flushed with ethyl acetate (320 mL) into a 1 L single-necked round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (150-75 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The product is transferred, with the assistance of ethyl acetate washes (2 x 10 mL), to a 250 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask and evaporated further (160 mmHg to 30 mmHg). The resultant white-yellowish solid is then broken up with a glass rod (Figure 4a). A 3 cm Teflon coated stir bar is added followed by ethanol (Note 22) (150 mL), and the flask is equipped with a water-cooled condenser. The flask is heated to reflux in an aluminium heating mantle and stirred for 25 min until complete dissolution to give a yellow solution. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature and then placed in a freezer at -22 \u00b0C for 19 h. The resultant crystals were filtered off and washed with hexane (3 x 25 mL) (Note 23) to give fine off-white crystals (Figure 4b).\nThe crystals are transferred to a 100 mL single-necked flask and then toluene (30 mL) (Note 24) is added to give a slightly grey suspension (Figure 4c). The solvents are removed under reduced pressure (75 mmHg to 35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then the product is dried under vacuum (0.14 mmHg, 1 h, room temperature) to give a fine off white powder (Figure 4d) (Note 25). The powder is transferred to a 250 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask (using 10 mL dichloromethane to rinse the flask) containing a 3 cm Teflon coated stir bar. Dichloromethane (80 mL) is added, the mixture is stirred for 10 min and then the yellow solution (Figure 4e) is filtered through cotton wool (Note 26), which is then washed with dichloromethane (4 x 10 mL), eluting under gravity into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask (Note 27). The solvent is evaporated (450 mmHg - 35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a white solid (Figure 4f), which is broken up with a glass rod and then dried under vacuum (60 \u00b0C, 0.12 mmHg, 96 h) (6.67 g, 96%, >99% purity) (Notes 28, 29, 30, and 31).\nFigure 4. a) Solid after filtration through a silica pad; b) Solid after first crystallization; c) Grey suspension of the white crystals in toluene; d) The final product before filtration through cotton; e) Yellow solution of the product before filtration through cotton; f) Compound 4"

            "For the past 50 years, benzynes and related arynes have been a major subject of study among physical organic chemists due to their unusual electronic and structural properties. However, the utility of these strained intermediates in the domain of chemical synthesis has only relatively recently undergone a vibrant expansion. The direct insertion of aryne and heteroaryne moieties into carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom \u03c3 bonds presents an intriguing and unique strategy for the rapid functionalization of aryl and heteroaryl systems. Following our 2009 Organic Syntheses article on the acyl-alkylation of arynes with \u03b2-ketoesters,2 there have been numerous reports of related transformations involving these highly reactive intermediates. This discussion addendum is intended to document advances made in the field of (hetero)arynes since our initial disclosure. Topics covered will be divided as follows: recent methods for the acyl-functionalization of arynes, syntheses of related strained systems, applications in heterocycle synthesis, miscellaneous transformations, and strategic uses in natural product synthesis. A supplemental review on aryne insertions into \u03c3 bonds is available.3 Applications of arynes in transition metal catalysis will not be discussed in detail, however there are thorough reviews on the subject.4,5\nAcyl-functionalization of Arynes\nYoshida reported an analogous acyl-alkylation method to ours, but using trifluoromethyl ketones (2, Scheme 1).6 The trifluoromethyl group is required because it enhances the acidity of the \u03b1-keto C-H bonds. The authors note that the presence of bulky R groups on the aryl system of 2 results in competitive O-addition of the enolate intermediate.\nScheme 1. Aryne insertion into benzyl trifluoromethyl ketones\nOur lab has discovered a related insertion of arynes into various symmetrical imides 3 to afford acyl-aminated arenes 4 (Scheme 2).7 The difunctionalized products can be derivatized to quinolones and indoles. Christmann and coworkers later applied the principles of flow chemistry to this acyl-amination protocol with unsymmetrical imides, achieving the total synthesis of several natural products.8\nScheme 2. Aryne insertion into imides\nThe Biju group disclosed an amino-carboxylation of arynes using aniline derivatives (Scheme 3).9 This method offers a divergent approach for the synthesis of differentially substituted acyl-aminated arenes depending on the electronics of the aniline ring.\nScheme 3. Tunable acyl-amination of arynes with anilines\nArynes in Heterocycle Synthesis\nPerhaps the greatest recent synthetic advances in aryne chemistry are dedicated to the one-step construction of heterocycles (Figure 1). Larock provides an excellent review on the subject.10 The Larock group has also disclosed numerous aryne annulation approaches for the synthesis of dihydrobenzisoxazoles (5),11 indazoles (6),12,13 and pyrido[1,2-a]indoles (7 and 8).14 Shioji and coworkers disclosed the preparation of xanthones (9), xanthenes, and xanthols using arynes.15 Our lab has reported the divergent synthesis of iminoindenones and iminoisobenzofurans (10) via a three-component procedure.16 We have also disclosed the one-pot preparation of 3-hydroxyisoquinolines (11) through an acyl-alkylation/condensation approach.17 Additionally, we reported the formation of N-phenyl acridone (12) by means of a C-N insertion of \u03b2-lactam.18 The Studer lab disclosed the rapid synthesis of N-substituted carbazoles (13) by reacting arynes with nitrosoarenes.19 Greaney and coworkers prepared phenoxathiin-dioxides (14) via a thia-Fries/cyclization process.20 The Kobayashi group reported the formation of isocoumarins (15) via a Pd-catalyzed three-component reaction between arynes, alkynes, and carbon dioxide.21 Isocoumarins can also be prepared under transition-metal-free conditions.22 Biju presented methods for the synthesis of oxaphosphacycles (16),23 phthalimides (17),24 and indoles (18).25 The Greaney lab has also synthesized indoles from arynes by means of a Fischer indole-type reaction.26 The Miyabe group reported the synthesis of benzofurans (19).27 They have also discovered the cycloaddition between arynes and DMF to afford 4-aminobenzopyrans such as20.28 The Li group prepared benzothiazoles (21) by means of a relay aryne sequence.29 Lastly, Su and coworkers prepared 2-arylated benzoxazoles (22) by means of a domino aryne reaction.30\nFigure 1. Various heterocycles recently assembled by aryne annulation methods\nMethods for the Synthesis Heteroarynes and Other Strained Intermediates\nIn 2010, our lab reported the formation of highly substituted aryne precursors and their potential synthetic applications in the construction of complex molecules (Figure 2).31 The marked carbons denote the preferred site of selective nucleophilic attack following aryne formation.\nFigure 2. Synthesizable highly substituted aryne precursors\nThe laboratory of Garg has investigated various insertion strategies with heteroarynes and other strained ring systems. Because many of these reactions result in unsymmetrical products, they have computationally derived a model for predicting the regioselectivity during the insertion step based on angle distortion.32,33 This model has been exploited for the regioselective insertion of indolynes,34 pyridynes,35,36 piperidynes,37 as well as various oxacyclic alkynes (Figure 3).38 Contemporaneously, the Danheiser lab reported the first preparation and diverse applications of N-tosylpiperidynes.39 It is worthwhile to note that the preferred site of nucleophilic attack may be either enhanced or overturned depending on the substitution pattern on the heteroaryl ring. The chemistry of pyrimidynes has also been investigated, but there have been no reports of their successful formation.40\nFigure 3. Strained heterocycles studied recently by the Garg and Danheiser labs\nSimilar insertion strategies have been achieved with strained non-aromatic carbocycles such as cyclopentyne (23, Figure 4),41 cyclohexyne (24), and cyclic allene 25.42\nFigure 4. Strained non-aromatic ring systems\nThe Hoye group has vigorously studied the generation of arynes via an unusual hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction (HDDA, Figure 5).43,44 Areas of study in the field are numerous, including Lewis-acid-promoted C-H insertion,45 domino reactions,46,47 photochemistry,48,49 mechanistic studies,50,51 multicomponent reactions,52 and natural product diversification.53 The regioselectivity for the ensuing insertion process is influenced by both the choice of nucleophile and the substituents on the aryne system.54 The Lee group has demonstrated that these HDDA adducts can also participate in ene reactions.55\nFigure 5. A hexadehydro-Diels-Alder affords an aryne\nThe advent of silylaryl-1,3-ditriflates such as 26 has given rise to aryne relay chemistry (Scheme 4). Li and coworkers demonstrated the utility of these substrates as a means to generate trifunctionalized systems with thioamides, furnishing benzothiazoles (27).29 A plausible mechanism for this process is shown below. They have also achieved similar relay chemistry with sulfoxides56 and sulfonamides.57,58,59 In 2016, Yoshida reported an advancement of this concept.60 The Li group discovered that these latent 1,2-benzdiynes can also participate in ene reactions.61\nScheme 4. One-pot elaboration of 1,2-benzdiyne precursor 26 to benzothiazole 27\nMiscellaneous Transformations\nMany recent methods involving arynes are not readily classifiable in the above sections. This section provides a brief survey of such transformations. The Greaney group has discovered a means of difunctionalizing arynes with thioureas to afford thioaryl amidines.62 They also pioneered other heterofunctionalization strategies via three-component coupling63 and Truce-Smiles rearrangement.64 The Biju group has found many novel applications of arynes, including their ability to induce 2,3-Stevens rearrangements in allylthioethers.65,66 They have also identified arynes as latent aryl anion equivalents.67 The Studer lab has reported the formation of ortho-sulfinylaryl vinyl ethers,68 biphenyls,69 trialkylstannyl arylphosphanes,70 and sulfonium ylides71 by means of aryne insertion chemistry. The Lautens group has actively explored the applications of the intramolecular aryne-ene reactions.72,73\nDespite a resurgent interest in the study of benzyne, there remain relatively few methods for the preparation of the trimethylsilylaryl triflate precursor (1, Scheme 5).74 In 2009, the Garg lab reported a facile synthesis of precursor 1 in three steps starting from phenol (28).75 Thus, 28 was treated with isopropyl isocyanate (29) to afford carbamate 30. Following N-silylation, a directed ortho-lithiation and subsequent trapping with TMSCl provides silylarene 31 upon acidic workup. The carbamate functionality of 31 is next cleaved by aminolysis to form transient phenol derivative 32, which is converted to silylaryl triflate 1 by reaction with N-phenyl triflimide.\nScheme 5. Garg's 3-step synthesis of benzyne precursor 1\nThere has been one report harnessing arynes and cyclic alkynes for the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centers (Scheme 6).76 Chiral enamine auxiliaries bearing 9-anthryl substituents were found to confer the highest levels of stereoinduction.\nScheme 6. Asymmetric formation of quaternary centers with arynes\nArynes in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn recent years, arynes have enjoyed a privileged role in total synthesis. For more information, we recommend consulting two reviews77,78 and the references therein. In 2010, our lab performed an enantioselective synthesis of (-)-curvularin (34, Scheme 7) and (\u2212)-diplodialide C via aryne acyl-alkylation.79 The requisite macrocycle 33 was constructed by means of a ring-closing metathesis.\nScheme 7. Concise synthesis of 34 enabled by aryne acyl-alkylation\nSimilarly, Yoshida and coworkers presented an expedient approach to the synthesis of cytosporone B (35, Scheme 8), relying on an acyl-alkylation disconnection.80\nScheme 8. Retrosynthetic analysis of 35 leads to an aryne insertion\nThe Buszek group reported the total synthesis of cis-trikentin A (37, Scheme 9) using an indolyne cycloaddition.81 In this case, the indolyne intermediate is generated from dibromide 36 via lithium-halogen exchange and subsequent elimination.\nScheme 9. Facile synthesis of 37 via an indolyne cycloaddition\nLikewise, the Garg lab reported a synthesis of various N-methylwelwitindolinones such as 3882 by means of an indolyne cyclization (Scheme 10).83,84,85,86,87 Here, indolyne formation is triggered by base-induced halide elimination. The authors note minor issues of competing O-addition of the enolate in intermediate 39.\nScheme 10. Garg's retrosynthetic analysis of 38 reveals an indolyne annulation\nArgade and coworkers disclosed the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-cruciferane (40, Scheme 11) using aryne chemistry.88 Notably, the crucial aryne insertion step occurs in excellent yield.\nScheme 11. Expedient total synthesis of 40 by aryne cyclization\nThe Garg lab has incorporated carbazolyne chemistry in the total syntheses of tubingensin A89 (41, Scheme 12) and tubingensin B.90 The labeled quaternary stereocenter in 41 is formed in good yield and with exquisite diastereoselectivity due to the rigid conformational constraints on the system.\nScheme 12. Retrosynthesis of tubingensin A (41) by carbazolyne annulation\nGarg has also synthesized indolactam-containing natural products such as indolactam V (43, Scheme 13).91 The strategically placed bromide substituent in 42 is essential for overturning the inherent regioselectivity associated with the key C-N bond-forming step.\nScheme 13. Synthesis of indolactam V (43) by indolyne amination\nThe Lee group leveraged HDDA chemistry for the rapid total synthesis of selaginpulvilin D (46, Scheme 14).92 It is interesting to note that despite occurring under formally oxidizing conditions, the benzyne intermediate arising from an intramolecular HDDA of tetrayne 44 undergoes in situ transfer hydrogenation by the action of cyclooctane to afford fluorenone 45.\nScheme 14. Lee's total synthesis of 46 hinges on an elegant oxidation/intramolecular HDDA/hydrogenation sequence\nIn 2018, the Sarpong lab reported the acyl-alkylation of benzyne derivative 47 to access the seven-membered carbocyclic core of the diterpenoid alkaloid cossonidine (Scheme 15).93 Once again, a bromide substituent is necessary in order to ensure proper regioselectivity.\nScheme 15. Sarpong's acyl-alkylation approach to the central seven-membered ring of cossonidine\nZhu and coworkers disclosed a novel heteroannulation of arynes using \u03b1-amino imides.94 This method was employed for the total synthesis of (+)-hinckdentine A (48, Scheme 16).\nScheme 16. Zhu harnessed a novel acyl-amination strategy for the total synthesis of 48\nRecently, our lab reported the non-biomimetic total syntheses of (-)-jorunnamycin A (50, Scheme 17) and (-)-jorumycin in 15 and 16 steps, respectively.95 Amid this route, one of the necessary isoquinoline monomers was prepared using aryne chemistry. In this instance, the acyl-alkylation product is subjected to in situ condensation with ammonium hydroxide to afford densely functionalized isoquinoline 49.17 Remarkably, four of the five carbon-based stereocenters present in 50 are set in one step via an iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Unlike previous approaches to these bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline natural products, this route is amenable to the synthesis of a diverse array of nonnatural analogs, because the aryne chemistry is independent of classical Pictet-Spengler approaches that have been employed in the syntheses of these alkaloids.\nScheme 17. Formation of isoquinoline monomer 49 en route to (-)-jorunnamycin A (50) and (-)-jorumycin\nConcluding Remarks\nClearly the field of aryne chemistry has experienced rapid growth over the last decade. In addition to the discovery of various methods strategically related to our initial acyl-alkylation disclosure, there have been many other impressive applications in the context of methods and total synthesis. Based on these recent developments, it is evident that these curious and highly reactive intermediates will continue to inspire chemists to discover new and synthetically useful reactions for the foreseeable future."

            "Enantiopure 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes and their dichlorodiol precursors have proven to be useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex natural products. Since 2000, the Organic Syntheses article2 and the primary reference3 have been cited over 100 times. While these C2 symmetric bis-electrophiles have most commonly been employed in the installation of anti-1,3 diol motifs, they have also recently been leveraged in development of new methods and utilized in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. These applications, as well as the use of these materials in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products, will be discussed.\nThe original procedure (Scheme 1A) utilizes a reversible acyl transfer reaction of acetylacetone (1) using aluminum trichloride and chloroacetyl chloride.4 The reaction is driven forward through removal of acetyl chloride by distillation and the resulting dichlorodione is isolated (57-58% yield) as copper complex 2. The dione is then liberated from the metal under acidic conditions and subjected to Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation5,6,7,8,9 under high pressure to give dichlorodiol R,R-3 in 40% yield after recrystallization, which undergoes double cyclization under basic conditions to form bis-epoxide R,R-4 (92% yield; >97% ee). The initial report also demonstrates the title compound's utility in synthesizing 1,3-diol motifs (Scheme 1B).3 Treatment of bis-epoxide 4 with unhindered nucleophiles affords symmetric anti-1,3-diols (5) in high yields (61-96%). Controlled monoadditions to bis-epoxide 4 using organolithium species at low temperatures in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt210 provide epoxy alcohols (6) in good yields (56-79%). These epoxy alcohols can be efficiently converted to differentially substituted anti-1,3-diols (7) upon treatment with a second nuceophile (63-89% yields), or converted to syn-1,3-diols through Mitsunobu inversion11,12 of the free hydroxyl. Early applications of these anti-1,3-diol strategies are highlighted in the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin13 and roflamycoin.14\nScheme 1. Synthesis of (R,R)-1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane; double addition and sequential addition to the bis-epoxide with organometallic nucleophiles\nSimultaneous Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin (11, Scheme 2), the ethereal tetrahydropyran (THP) ring provided a natural application of the double addition strategy.13 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with an excess of vinylmagnesium bromide in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuI at -78 \u00b0C provided bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 in 90% yield. Diol 8 underwent an acid-catalyzed transacetalization to afford high yields of acetal 9. The C2 symmetric acetal was then poised to undergo an intramolecular Prins cyclization15/desymmetrization with concomitant acetate trapping to provide THP-diacetate 10 in 42% overall yield. This noteworthy sequence leveraged the symmetry of the bis-epoxide to correctly install the 2,4,6-cis-THP stereochemistry, as well as the C19 stereocenter. The bis-homoallylic diol (8) generated by this double addition strategy has proven useful in a number of other synthetic programs.\nScheme 2. Rychnovsky's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin\nThe synthesis of (+)-obolactone (14, Scheme 3) by Br\u00fcckner and Walleser employed the same conditions from the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin to transform bis-epoxide R,R-4 to bis-homoallylic diol S,S-8.16 Diol 8 was then protected using 2,2-dimethoxypropane under acidic conditions to provide acetonide 12 in 95% yield. One of the alkene functional groups of the C2-symmetric acetal underwent a subsequent symmetry-breaking Wacker oxidation.17,18,19 Treatment of acetonide 12 with catalytic PdCl2 under an atmosphere of oxygen using CuCl as the stoichiometric oxidant afforded a 64% yield of methyl ketone 13, with over-oxidation to the diketone also observed (18% yield). The methyl ketone functionality of 13 was critical for the installation of the dihydro-\u03b3-pyranone moiety in the natural product, while the syn-orientation of the C\u00ad-O bonds was achieved through Mitsunobu inversion of the lactone stereocenter. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser specifically mention that while Krische and co-workers have reported on an impressive single-step procedure for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of bis-homoallylic diol (S,S-4) from 1,3-propanediol (Scheme 4),20 and have used this method extensively in the synthesis of polyketide natural products,21,22 the high cost of catalyst and ligand precluded their use on scale in this case.\nScheme 3. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's synthesis of (+)-obolactone\nScheme 4. Krische's one-step synthesis of S,S-8.\nBr\u00fcckner and Walleser also used bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 as the starting point for their work on a unified synthetic strategy toward ent-filipin III and ent-pentamycin (20 & 21), as shown in Scheme 5.23 Symmetry-breaking Mitsunobu inversion of bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 was achieved by treatment with crotonic acid, triphenyl phosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) in toluene to give monoester 16 in 62% yield. The free hydroxyl group of 16 was then converted to sulfonate ester 17 in high yield using vinylsulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. Tetraene 17 was subjected to double ring closing metathesis using Grubbs II catalyst24 in toluene at 100 \u00b0C to afford bicyclic intermediate 18. This bicyclic lactone was further elaborated to acetonide 19 constituting a synthesis of the C1-C10 or \"southwestern\" portion of the polyketides.\nScheme 5. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's approach to ent-filipin and ent-pentamycin\nAnother example of double addition using an organomagnesium nucleophile was utilized in Eustache and co-workers synthesis of attenol A (27, Scheme 6).25 Treatment of bis-epoxide R,R-4 with 3-butenylmagnesium bromide in the presence of CuI at -40 \u00b0C provided diene diol S,S-22 in 88% yield. Diol S,S-22 was then converted to PMP-acetal 23 in high yield (88%) through acid-catalyzed transacetalization. Reductive cleavage of the benzylic C-O bond by the action of sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions afforded PMB ether 24 in 76% yield. The free hydroxyl group of mono-protected diol 24 was then poised for intermolecular iodoetherification when treated with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in the presence of potassium carbonate. The resulting differentially protected diol derivative 25 was obtained in 80% yield and carried forward as inconsequential mixture of diastereomers to access spiroketal 26 en route to attentol A.\nScheme 6. Eustache's synthesis of attenol A\nPerhaps the most complex example of simultaneous double addition is seen in Smith and Pitrem's synthesis of the Schrieber trisacetonide in their synthesis of mycoticins A and B (33 & 34, Scheme 7).26,27 This single-pot, five-component linchpin coupling strategy utilized bis-epoxide S,S-4 as the central five carbon piece of the C16-C28 fragment of the natural products. The sequence began with lithiation of silyl dithiane 28, which opened the epoxide of (-)-benzyl glycidyl ether 29 to give alkoxide 30. Upon warming, the transient intermediate underwent an intramolecular [1,4]-Brook rearrangement28,29 to generate an organolithium poised for double addition into bis-epoxide S,S-4 to afford diol 31 in 59% overall yield. This remarkable sequence forged four C-C bonds and provided the entire carbon framework of the C16-C28 fragment in a single operation.\nScheme 7. Smith's synthesis of mycoticin A and B\nIn an interesting example of post-double addition functionalization, Tang and Werness were able to exploit the C2-symmetry of bis-epoxide R,R-4 to synthesize the 2,5-cis-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran (THF) core of the marine sesquiterpene (-)-kumausallene (37, Scheme 8).30 Their strategy employed bis-allylic diol R,R-35, which was accessed through a protocol developed by Hanson and co-workers (vide infra). Treatment of diol 35 with a catalytic amount of PdCl2 in the presence of CO and NaOAc using CuCl2 as the stoichiometric oxidant initiated a carbonylative cascade reaction31,32 to provide bicyclic lactone 36 in 87% yield. This key transformation installed the requisite stereochemistry of the central portion of the natural product, as well as appropriate synthetic handles for further functionalization.\nScheme 8. Tang's synthesis of (-)-kumausallene\nSequential Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nFor Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of roflamycoin (45), the hemiketal-pyran linkage required differential substitution (Scheme 9) and demonstrated the power of the sequential double addition strategy.14 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with a stoichiometric amount of (benzyloxy)methyllithium 38 and BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C provided mono-addition adduct 39, which was then treated with the organolithium formed from transmetallation of 2,2-bis-(tributyltin)dithiane 40. This single-pot procedure afforded dithiane diol 41 in 56% overall yield. Subsequent acetonide formation and transmetallation provided a competent nucleophile for direct displacement of dibromide42, which itself was derived from dichlorodiol R,R-3. The resulting bis-acetonide (43) was obtained in 60% overall yield and provided a rapid access to tris-acetonide 44, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the hemiketal-pyran moiety of 45. Similar sequential addition strategies have proven to be useful as well.\nScheme 9. Rychnovsky's synthesis of roflamycoin\nThough most commonly used in the synthesis of polyketide natural products, Evans and co-workers were able to employ bis-epoxide R,R-4 in the synthesis of polycyclic guanidinium alkaloid (-)-batzelladine D (51, Scheme 10).33 Addition of the transiently formed cuprate derived from catalytic CuCN and octyl Grignard reagent in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C led to formation of mono-addition adduct 46 in 71% yield. The resulting epoxy alcohol (46) was then treated with the ylide generated from the in situ deprotonation of trimethylsulfonium triflate to afford 95% yield of anti-1,3-diol 47. Conversion of diol 47 to cyclic carbonate 48 was achieved in 90% yield by treatment with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and pyridine. Cyclic carbonate 48 was then employed as the electrophile in a rhodium-catalyzed allylic amination.34 The LiHMDS-mediated deprotonation of dihydropyrimidinone 49 provided a nucleophile, which in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst and trimethyl phosphite displaced the allylic carbonate to forge the C-N bond of 50 in high conversion and selectivity (84% yield; dr \u2265 30:1). This sequence rapidly provided the required stereochemistry for the bicyclic guanidinium portion of (-)-batzelladine D.\nScheme 10. Evan's synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D\nHanson's synthesis of chiral bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triester building blocks\nWhile Mioskowski's conversion of epoxides to homologated allylic alcohols35 was used in Evans' synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D, the use of this transformation as it pertains to 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes was pioneered by Hanson and co-workers for their research in synthesis of phosphate triester building blocks.36 The simultaneous double addition of sulfonium ylides onto either chiral bis-epoxide S,S-4 or dichlorodiol S,S-3 to give the corresponding bis-allylic diol S,S-35 proceeded in high yields (76% and 80% yield, respectively) (Scheme 11).37 This was a critical reaction in the synthesis of chiral phosphate triesters. Condensation of diol 35 onto POCl3 in the presence of Et3N and DMAP provided cyclic chlorophosphate diester 52. Final chloride displacement was carried out with lithium allyloxide in THF at -40 \u00b0C to afford triene 53, which underwent a ring-closing metathesis reaction in the presence of Grubbs II catalyst24 to provide phosphate triester S,S,PS-54.\nScheme 11. Hanson's synthesis of tris-allylic phosphate triesters\nHanson and co-workers have shown these tethered phosphate esters to be versatile intermediates for organic synthesis.36 In addition to synthesis of complex natural products such as those seen in Figure 1,38,39,40,41 recent extensions of this technology include probing the complementary reactivity of the corresponding phosphite-borane tethers.42,43 While these reports demonstrate the utility of P-tethered building blocks, perhaps none more clearly highlight the versatility of these intermediates than Hanson's approach to dolabelide C.41 Retrosynthetic analysis of this 24-membered macrolide produced by the sea hare D. auricularia (58, Scheme 12) divided the macrolactone into two large fragments (59 and 60) that can come from the enantiomeric phosphate triesters R,R,PR-54 and S,S,PS-54.\nFigure 1. Complex products synthesized using phosphate triester building blocks\nScheme 12. Hanson's retrosynthetic analysis of dolabelide C\nSynthesis of the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C, shown in Scheme 13, began with cross metathesis of phosphate triester R,R,PR-54 and alkene 61 in the presence of the 2nd generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst44,45,46 to give phosphate diene 62. Regioselective reduction of the exocyclic alkene in 62 required treatment with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazine and Et3N as the phosphate esters are not tolerant of more basic diimide reduction protocols. The resulting cyclic alkene 63 was then subjected to a Pd-catalyzed formate reduction that regioselectively delivered hydride to the C10 position resulting in the desired terminal alkene 64. With a majority of the northwest coupling fragment assembled, alkene 64 was further elaborated to carboxylic acid 59 in 11 steps.\nScheme 13. Hanson's approach to the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C\nA similar cross metathesis/reduction strategy was employed for the 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment (Scheme 14) to convert S,S,PS-54 to cyclic alkene 67. In this case, regio- and diastereoselective methyl cuprate addition proceeded in an SN2\u2032 fashion to afford terminal alkene 68. This advanced intermediate was carried through another 10 steps to provide southwest fragment 60. Though containing a problematic MOM protecting group strategy, the 1st generation synthesis of this fragment also demonstrated the phosphate triester moiety's tolerance to both hydroboration/oxidation conditions, as well as an acidic PMB protection protocol.\nScheme 14. Hanson's 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment of dolabelide C\nHanson's chiral phosphate triesters have proven to be useful building blocks for organic synthesis with new modes of reactivity still to be discovered. Advancements in this technology were facilitated by the synthetic route developed for the bis-epoxide and dichlorodiol precursors, which speaks to the reliability of the procedure. In addition to enabling new technologies, these intermediates have also found utility in the context of providing straightforward access to enantioenriched variants of classically important synthetic intermediates.\nAub\u00e9's extension through synthesis of valuable chiral building blocks\nAs shown in Figure 2, 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenones (4-HCP) have long been a privileged scaffold in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, including prostaglandins, alkaloids and terpene natural products.47,48,49 As such, the ability to access either enantiomer of this class of molecules has been a long standing area of interest for synthetic organic chemists. Aub\u00e9 and co-workers provided a compelling strategy to synthesize a variety of hydroxyl protected 4\u00ad-HCP derivatives in enantioenriched forms.50 The synthetic strategy, shown in Scheme 15, involves using Hanson's protocol to access bis-allylic diol R,R-35 from dichlorodiol R,R-3. Monoprotection of C2-symmetric diol R,R-35 proceeded in high yields (66-95%) for a variety of protecting groups. The resulting dienes (72) were able to smoothly undergo a RCM reaction using Grubbs I catalyst51 to give cyclopentenol derivatives (73, 88-92% yields), which were then oxidized with pyridium chlorochromate to the corresponding cyclopentenones (74) in high yields (92-94%) on gram scale. In addition, this report also provided conditions for further functionalization of both the cyclopentenol derivatives and 4-HCPs.\nFigure 2. Select examples of natural products synthesized using 4-HCPs\nScheme 15. Aub\u00e9's synthesis of enantioenriched 4-HCP derivatives\nSingh and Aub\u00e9 used dichlorodiol R,R-3 as a key intermediate in their syntheses of spatially directed cyclohexane-1,3-diols (Scheme 16).52 Analogous to the monoprotection of bis-allylic diol R,R-35, dichlorodiol R,R-3 underwent monohydroxyl protection by the action of TIPSCl in the presence of n-BuLi to afford dichloride 75 in 92% yield. To synthesize cyclohexyl derivatives, dichloride 75 was then converted to chloroepoxide 76 in 95% yield under basic conditions. In the presence of Smith's linchpin dithiane 77, chloroepoxide 76 underwent an epoxide opening/Brook rearrangement sequence. The transient carbanion subsequently displaced the remaining chloride to provide differentially protected cyclohexane 78, which can be selectively deprotected in a variety of ways. This method is complementary to the work of Linclau et al., who used dithiane linchpin coupling on bis-epoxides (e.g. 4) to construct cyclopentyl nucleosides.53,54\nScheme 16. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of cyclohexyl trans-1,3-diols\nIn addition to cyclohexane-1,3-diols, Singh and Aub\u00e9 also used dichloride 75 to synthesize piperidine and thiane derivatives as well (Scheme 17). In the case of piperidine derivatives, dichloride 75 was first converted to diiodide 82 through a double Finkelstein reaction.55,56 This more potent bis-electrophile was primed to undergo a double displacement with benzylamine to give piperidine 83 in 88% yield. The increased nucleophilicity of sulfur meant that dichloride 75 was a competent bis-electrophile for the double displacement and provided thiane 85 in 88% yield when treated with sodium sulfide. These heterocycles also underwent standard silyl group cleavage to give the corresponding 1,3-diols (84 and 86) in high yields (94% and 92%, respectively).\nScheme 17. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of piperidinyl and thianyl trans-1,3-diols\nConcluding Remarks\nThe enantiopure forms of 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane (4) and dichlorodiol (3) have been used by many groups as chiral precursors for organic synthesis. The original procedure is convenient and scalable, providing access to either enantiomer based on readily available and inexpensive chiral BINAP ligands. Displacement at the primary positions lead to a variety of simple enantiopure cyclic and acyclic building blocks. These typically occur either through simultaneous double addition of organometallic nucleophiles to give C2 symmetric diols or sequential double addition to give asymmetric diols. While the resulting 1,3-diol motif has most commonly found utility in the context of polyketide natural product synthesis, applications to alkaloid and terpene natural products have also been described. In addition, this method has provided straightforward access to bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triesters and 4-hydroxycyclopentenones derivatives, themselves valuable synthetic intermediates. Based on these recent developments, 4 and 3 will continue to provide synthetic chemists with useful entry points for chiral synthesis and enable new modes of reactivity."

            "The title compound, henceforth designated dbcot, was first prepared in 1946.2 It typically served to prepare analogs of cod-complexes of transition metals. Anton and Crabtree found that dbcot is bound more tightly and is more electron with\u00addrawing than cod in complexes of low-valent transition metal ions.3 This ob\u00ad\u00adservation led to the first application of dbcot as a rea\u00adgent, the Crabtree test (1983),4 which was based on the finding that dbcot is an inhibitor of homo- but not heterogeneous transition metal catalysts. Per\u00adhaps due to difficulties associated with earlier syntheses, dbcot chemistry received wider attention only after 2002, when Wudl et al.5 reported a con\u00adve\u00adnient synthesis, which was some\u00adwhat improved by our group.\nThis discussion addendum is focused on uses of dbcot and a few deri\u00advatives in catalysis. Useful procedures for prepa\u00adra\u00adtion of these compounds are also outlined. Fun\u00adda\u00admental metalorganic and coordination che\u00admistry of dbcot have been reviewed recent\u00adly (2019)6 and are here only dis\u00adcus\u00adsed in conjunction with cata\u00adlysis.\n\nPreparation of Dbcot and Dbcot Derivatives\nThe procedures currently in use are all based on Wudl's work. The route to dbcot, as streamlined by us, has been used by several groups without problems. Nevertheless, members of one of the groups expressed concern about the lachrymatory effect of a,a'-dibromo-o-xylene and the use of carbon tetrachloride as solvent in the bromination step.7\nWudl's work was also directed at the diyne 7 and included a ring enlar\u00adgement of the commercially available dibenzosuberone (4) with trimethylsi\u00adlyldiazomethane to give the ketone 5 (70%) (Scheme 1).5 This ketone was used by Chen and Hartwig for the development of a second route to dbcot by adding a Shapiro reaction via the hydazone 6 to give dbcot (1) in 83% yield (Scheme 1).8\nScheme 1. A second practical route to dbcot (1)\nGr\u00fctzmacher et al.9 prepared a series of 5-aryl-dbcot derivatives from the ketone 5 in two simple steps (Scheme 2) and used them as ligands of transition metal catalysts. A chiral Rh-complex of 9a, obtained by resolution, gave promising results in an enantioselective Hayashi-Miyaura reaction. While the Rh-complex was stable against racemization, the free ligand (R)-9a underwent complete racemization by tub to tub interconversion within > 3 h at room temperature.\nScheme 2. A route to monoaryl substituted dbcot derivatives 9\nStrand et al.10 advanced the topic of asymmetric catalysis by using C2-symmetric derivatives 12 of dbcot (Scheme 3). Their synthesis commenced with the dibromide 2, which was transformed into the dione 10 according to a known procedure (Kornblum oxidation),11 which proceeded in good yield but required two equivalents of silver tosylate. The dione 10 was trans\u00adformed into the bis-triflate 11 by treatment with Tf2O. Finally, cross coup\u00adling using an Fe- and a Pd-catalyst, furnished 5,11-methyl- (12a) and 5,11-phenyl-dbcot (12b), respectively. Enantiomers of both 12a and 12b could be separated by semi-preparative chiral column chromatography. The enantiomers equilibrate by tub to tub isomerization with a barrier of \u00bb 30 kcal/mol; accordingly, racemization at room temperature is slow.\nThe benzologue 16 (dncot) of dbcot was already prepared in 1990 in low yield.12 A convenient high yield route was developed by Wender et al. (Scheme 4).13 a,a'-Dibromo-o-xylene served as starting material; the reaction with ethynyltrimethysilane furnished the dialkyne 13 in almost quantitative yield. Subsequent deprotection to give 14 was carried out in excellent yield with 3 equivalents of silver cyanide. In the meantime, catalytic methods (10 mol% of AgNO3) have been developed14 that likely would allow simpli\u00adfication of the deprotection step. Nickel-catalyzed [2+2+2+2]-cycloaddition to give 15 followed by oxidation furnished crystalline dncot (16) in high overall yield. Addition of bromine followed by base-promoted elimination gave the bromide 17. This allowed preparation of a variety of further de\u00adrivatives 18 of dncot by substitution or cross coupling reactions.\nScheme 3. Preparation of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives 12\nScheme 4. Preparation of dncot (15) according to Wender\n\nUses in Catalysis\n\nRhodium-Catalyzed 1,4- and 1,2-Additions of Arylboronic Acids\nInterest in dbcot as a constituent of catalysts rather than as an inhibitor, cf the Crabtree test, began after Hayashi and Carreira in 2003 introduced chi\u00adral dienes 19 and 20, respectively, as ligands of Rh-catalysts of the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction (Figure 1) 15,16a and an Ir-catalyzed kinetic resolution allylic substitution.16b\nRh-Complexes of dienes such as cod, 19 and 20 are not very stable. This observation induced Gr\u00fctzmacher et al. (2005)9 to employ Rh-complexes of the dbcot derivatives 9 as catalysts. The complex (R)-21b furnished excellent yield and modest but promising enantioselectivity for the 1,4-addition of phenylboronic acid to cyclohexen-2-one (Scheme 5).\nFigure 1. Chiral diene ligands and complexes\nScheme 5. Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\nFollowing the rule that C2-symmetry is an advantageous property of a chiral ligand, Strand and co-workers prepared the enantiomerically pure Rh-complexes (S,S)-22a and -22b (Figure 1) from the ligands 12a and 12b, respectively.10 With these, the expected high enantioselectivities were indeed ob\u00adtained with cyclic as well as acyclic enones and enoates (Scheme 6). In ad\u00addition, highly enantioselective 1,2-additions of arylboronic acids to a-keto\u00adesters were realized by the Strand group.10\nScheme 6. Use of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives in the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\n\nIridium-Catalyzed Allylic Substitutions\nThe Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution was introduced in 1997 and found immediate interest because of preference for the branched, chiral substitution product.17 Continuous development has led to two very robust and highly regioselective as well as enantioselective versions (type I, Scheme 7,18 and type II19)20 with many applications in the area of biologically active com\u00adpounds.21 Both versions rely on catalysts prepared from the complex [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and a chiral phosphine. Earlier on it was not clear, whether cod was incorporated into the active catalyst. It turned out that cod is preserved in type I and lost in type II substitutions. This finding was an incentive to explore dbcot-derived catalysts in type I substitutions.\nScheme 7. Ir-catalyzed enantioselective allylic substitutions of type I\nThere are several improvements to be gained by using dbcot-complexes in type I allylic substitutions: (a) Dbcot-Ir-complexes display enhanced ther\u00admal stability, because dbcot is stronger bound to IrI than cod. (b) Reactions with cod-complexes as catalysts require strict exclusion of oxygen. In stark contrast, the corresponding reactions with dbcot-complexes can be run under air and with aqueous solvents. (c) With cod, reactions often display unsatis\u00adfactory regioselectivity in case of aliphatic substituents R. With dbcot im\u00adprovement is gained because of its enhanced electron acceptor capacity.\nAn interesting example illustrating point (a) is due to Han et al. (Scheme 8).22 This (Tsuji) reaction involves a decarboxylative allylic substitution as the key step. With cod as an ancillary ligand, the reaction did not proceed up to a temperature of 85 \u00b0C and a reaction time of 24 h, presumably because of decomposition of the catalyst. A highly selective reaction occurred with the corresponding dbcot derived catalyst at 60 \u00b0C within 6 h.\nScheme 8. Tsuji-type decarboxylative allylic etherification\nPoint (b), stability of the catalyst against air and water, is illustrated by Scheme 9.23 Previous attempts to accomplish an allylic hydroxylation using cod containing Ir-complexes failed in our and another laboratory.24 With dbcot as an ancillary ligand and bicarbonate as a nucleophile, the reaction could be performed with excellent results. The requisite Ir-complexes were obtained in a very convenient way as described in Scheme 10.25\nScheme 9. Enantioselective allylic hydroxylation\nScheme 10. One pot preparation of (allyl)Ir complexes\nTosatti et al. needed to employ similarly polar (DMSO) and aerobic con\u00additions in the development of an array of drug lead-like highly polar amino acid derivatives.26,27 Use of cod as ancillary ligand furnished yields below 5%. With dbcot excellent yields of the branched (exclusively) products were obtained (Scheme 11). Peters, et al. used the similarly polar solvent dimethylformamide in combination with the complex 24 successfully for a sequential allylic substitution/aza-Cope rearrangement process.28\nScheme 11. Aerobic allylic substitutions with highly polar amines in DMSO as a solvent\nImprovement of regioselectivity, i. e. point (c) above, is another incentive for the replacement of cod by dbcot or dncot. Results, taken from reference 29 for cod/dbcot and reference 30 for dncot, are presented in Figure 2.29,30 It is apparent that the latter ligands induce improved regioselectivity in favor of the branched products; this is likely due to their enhanced electron withdrawing capacity in comparison to that of cod. The (R)-enantiomer of the final product in Figure 2 was required as starting material for total syntheses of the natural products (+)-crypt- and (+)-infectocaryone.31 Many further examples concerning the influence of dbcot on regioselectivity have been reported by the You group.32\nFigure 2. Results of reactions according to Scheme 7 using various diene ligands (ligand L2)\n\nMiscellaneous reactions\nSince 1995 Wender et al. have developed syntheses of cycloheptane derivatives via intra- and intermolecular Rh-catalyzed [5+2] cycloaddition reac\u00adtions.33 Over the years progress with respect to reactivity and regioselec\u00adtivity was achieved by introducing new Rh-catalysts. Currently three catalysts are being used of which one contains dncot as a ligand (Scheme 12). The crucial problems for the intermolecular reaction are regioselectivity and rate (Figure 3).13 The dncot-complex excelled particularly with respect to regioselectivity. The influence of the ligand was elucidated by dft calculations.34\nFigure 3. Catalysts used in [5+2] cycloaddition reactions\nScheme 12. [5+2] Cycloaddition reactions according to Wender et al. (DCE: 1,2-dichlorethane, TFE: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol)\nZhang et al. have studied polymerization of phenylacetylenes with Rh-cod as well as Rh-dbcot-complexes as catalysts (Scheme 13).35 Once more dbcot-complexes, such as 21a, excelled, displaying higher stability and acti\u00advity than cod-complexes due to stronger Lewis acidity caused by the high \u03c0-acidity of dbcot. Thus, on water polymerization under aerobic conditions became feasible. Facile recovery and re-use of the catalysts was possible due to their water-solubility.\nScheme 13. Use of a dbcot-complex as polymerization catalyst\nFinally, Gr\u00fctzmacher et al.36 have developed the Ru-catalyst 26, which is a hydrogenase mimic in that it is able to both catalytically split and produce H2 by stepwise release of electrons and protons (Scheme 14). Turnover num\u00adbers up to 252 were found for the hydrogenation of vitamin K3; the quinoid moiety, rather than a double bond, was selectivity hydrogenated in the case of vitamin K2.\nScheme 14. Hydrogenase mimic devised by Gr\u00fctzmacher et al."

An oven-dried, 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a stopcock and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is cooled to room temperature under a flow of nitrogen. While temporarily removing the septum, the flask is charged with gold(III) chloride (AuCl3) (0.303 g, 1 mmol, 5 mol% Au) and silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf) (0.77 g, 3 mmol, 15 mol%) (Note 1) under N2. Dichloromethane (150 mL) (Note 2) is added, and the catalyst mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5\u20132 h, resulting in a brown suspension (Note 3). Dibenzoylmethane (4.48 g, 20 mmol) (Note 4) is added to the reaction flask over 2 min while temporarily removing the septum and the color of the reaction mixture turns green.

A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal thermometer, two rubber septa and a 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar (Note 1) is charged with phenylacetylene (6.37 mL, 58.0 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2) via syringe, 60 mL of THF (Note 3) via syringe, and the solution was cooled to an internal temperature of -70 \u00b0C or colder in a dry ice/acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (1.58 M, 30.8 mL, 48.7 mmol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min directly into the stirring solution of phenylacetylene, such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. The acetone/dry ice bath is replaced with an ice/water bath. When the reaction temperature reaches approximately \u22125 \u00b0C, dichlorodimethylsilane (2.80 mL, 23.2 mmol) (Note 5) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min, such that the internal temperature does not exceed 10 \u00b0C.

            "B. 2,5-Dibromo-1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilole (2). From this point forward the light sensitivity of some compounds necessitates that certain flasks be wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two rubber septa, an internal thermometer, and 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar. Under a stream of argon (introduced through a septum with a syringe needle and balloon), lithium wire (0.53 g, 75.6 mmol, 4.5 equiv) (Note 14) is cut into (20-25) small pieces and washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 10 mL) to remove the protective oil. One septum is temporarily removed and a funnel is used to aid in the addition of the lithium pieces. The flask is then fitted with a gas adapter and evacuated (1.5 mmHg) for 10 min to ensure that all toluene is removed. The gas adapter is removed and naphthalene (10.12 g, 79.0 mmol, 4.7 equiv) (Note 15) is added with the aid of a funnel. The original septum is replaced and 50 mL of THF (Note 3) is added via syringe. The flask is sonicated for 1 h to facilitate dissolution of the lithium wire (Note 16), and the resulting dark green solution is left to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The lithium naphthalenide solution thus obtained is titrated according to a literature method3 and found to be 1.35-1.45 M (Note 17), and the flask is wrapped in foil.\nInto a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1) (4.37 g, 16.8 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon) is added 120 mL of THF via syringe (Note 3). The resulting silane solution is added to the lithium naphthalenide dropwise, over a minimum of 20 min, via cannula (Note 18). Once the addition is complete, the solution is cooled to -10 \u00b0C using an acetone bath with a small amount of dry ice.\nMeanwhile, a solution of anhydrous ZnCl2 (11.45 g, 84.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 19) in 70 mL of THF added via syringe (Notes 3 and 20) is prepared in a 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm stir bar and rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The ZnCl2 solution is added to the naphthalenide/silane mixture via cannula over a minimum of 20 min (Note 21). The acetone/dry ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 22).\nMeanwhile, a 1-L, three-necked, foil-wrapped, round-bottomed flask is charged with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 7.45 g, 41.9 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 23) and equipped with an internal thermometer, 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar and two rubber septa (one pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The flask is charged with 35 mL of THF via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C or colder using a dry ice/acetone bath. The room temperature silane solution is added into the cold NBS solution via cannula such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is stirred for a further 30 min at -70 \u00b0C or colder. One septum is removed and the cold mixture is slowly poured into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 300-mL solution of rapidly stirring half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (Notes 7 and 24). The heterogeneous mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 mL of half-saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 (Note 25), 200 mL of water, 200 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (7 g) and quickly filtered through a thin pad of silica (Note 26) into a foil wrapped 500-mL single-necked flask. The yellow solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and then at 1.5 mmHg for 1 h to give approximately 17 g of crude material (quantitative mass recovery based on both naphthalene and dibromosilole 2). 1H NMR analysis of a representative sample typically shows a 1:5.2 mixture of the dibromosilole (2) and naphthalene (Note 27), which corresponds to a 96% yield (6.78 g) of useable dibromosilole (2). It is generally unnecessary to remove the naphthalene for subsequent use, such as cross coupling reactions.\nIf necessary, the naphthalene can be removed by sublimation in small batches. Thus, 1.7 g of the naphthalene-silole mixture is ground into powder using a mortar and pestle, and sublimed in the dark, under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 3-4 hours at 35 \u00b0C (Note 28). This will typically remove 99% of the naphthalene according to 1H NMR analysis. If desired, further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the residual material from the combined sublimations in hot hexanes (160 mL) followed by cooling in a freezer for 16 h. The pure 2,5-dibromosilole crystallizes as white needles, which are vacuum-filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice cold hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 6.64 g (95% yield) of 2. (Note 29, 30 and 31). Dibromosilole 2 stored in the dark at room temperature is stable for several weeks. Even brief exposure to sunlight during processing will lead to significant decomposition (Notes 24 and 30)."

Material adhering to the sides of the reaction flask is rinsed into the reaction mixture with 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, resulting in a clear, brown solution. Stirring is maintained and the reaction flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter fitted with a reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a thermocouple temperature probe adapter. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the system is placed in a heating mantle filled with sand (Note 9) and the thermocouple is inserted through the adapter. The solution is heated at 85 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 7 h (Notes 10, 11). Heating and stirring are then interrupted, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (Notes 12, 13). After removing the nitrogen inlet and the water condenser, the reaction mixture is concentrated for 1 h by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg). The residue is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) and treated with activated charcoal (3.0 g) (Note 14). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 30 min and filtered in vacuo through a Celite pad (Note 15) in a B\u00fcchner funnel. The Celite is carefully washed with three 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate (Note 16) and the combined washings are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with aqueous HCl (2 M, 250 mL) (Note 17) and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 125 mL portions of ethyl acetate.

A flame-dried, two-necked, 50-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with septa to prevent exposure to air. Needles are then used for both an argon inlet and gas outlet to a bubbler. To this flask is added Rh2(OAc)4 (47.4 mg, 0.214 mmol Rh, 0.2 mol%) (Note 1) followed by 2-bromopropene (18.5 mL, 25.2 g, 0.208 mol, 2.18 equiv) (Note 2) by syringe. The argon inlet is removed and ethyl diazoacetate (11.0 mL, 10.6 g, 92.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 3) is added by syringe pump over a period of two days (Note 4). Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 8 h (Note 5). The gas outlet is then removed and one septum is replaced with a one-piece, vacuum-jacketed short path distillation head containing an 18 mm (length) \u00d7 13 mm (OD) Vigreaux column. The excess 2-bromopropene is removed by distillation (760 mmHg, bp 42-45 \u00b0C) (Note 6). The reaction flask is cooled to room temperature, vacuum is applied (18\u201322 mmHg), and the flask is gradually heated in an oil bath to a bath temperature of 80 \u00b0C. This distillation provides 15.3-18.0 g (80-94% yield) of the bromo ester 1 (bp 64\u201373 \u00b0C, 18\u201322 mmHg) as a clear, colorless liquid (Notes 7\u20139).",

A flame-dried, two-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a septum and a condenser containing a septum. An argon inlet and gas outlet is introduced through the condenser septa using needles. Under argon atmosphere, sodium hydride (6.10 g, 0.153 mol, 1.77 equiv) (Note 10) and diethyl ether (110 mL) (Note 11) are added. Bromo ester 1 (17.9 g, 0.0864 mol, 1.00 equiv) is then added via cannula using 10 mL of diethyl ether to complete the transfer. The argon inlet needle is removed, leaving the reaction solution vented to a bubbler. The reaction mixture is brought to reflux (oil bath set to 45 \u00b0C) before ethanol (1.1 mL, 0.019 mol, 0.22 equiv) (Note 12) is added (CAUTION: addition of the ethanol should be done slowly over the course of several minutes to prevent excessive hydrogen gas evolution). The resulting, light-brown solution is stirred at reflux for 15 h (reaction progress can be monitored by GC-MS, Note 13). The reaction mixture is then cooled and the precipitated tan solid is filtered through a 1 cm pad of Celite\u00ae in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (8.5 cm ID). The residue is washed with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and the resulting yellow filtrate is distilled at 760 mmHg using a 12 cm (length) \u00d7 17 mm OD Vigreaux column and short path distillation apparatus (18 mm (length) \u00d7 13 mm (OD)) to remove the diethyl ether. Vacuum is then applied (13\u201314 mmHg) and the resulting yellow oil residue is then distilled to afford 7.75 g (71% yield) of 2-methylenecyclopropane carboxylic acid ethyl ester (2) (40\u201344 \u00b0C, 13\u201314 mmHg) as a clear, colorless liquid. A second distillation (Note 14), necessary to remove a trace impurity, is performed to provide 7.28 g (66% yield) of analytically pure product (Note 15)."

The solvent is then removed in vacuo at 0.01 mmHg, the residue is re-dissolved in hexanes (50 mL), and precipitation of LiCl is observed. The suspension is transferred to a flame-dried, 100-mL centrifuge vessel via cannula (Note 1), and is separated from the precipitated LiCl by centrifugation (7 min, 28,000 rpm). A suitable alternative to centrifugation is Schlenk filtration or any other technique that allows manipulation under inert atmosphere. Finally, the hexane supernatant is removed by cannula into a flame-dried, 100-mL Schlenk tube (Note 1).

An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 200-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel (placed in the central neck of the flask and fitted with a rubber septum) and a 3.2 cm \u00d7 1.6 cm, egg shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with sodium borohydride (30.0 g, 0.793 mol, 2.4 equiv) (Note 1) and 500 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The resulting suspension is cooled in an ice bath and stirred rapidly. The pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a previously prepared solution of iodine (83.9 g, 0.331 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) in 150 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The iodine-THF solution is added dropwise to the borohydride-THF suspension over 1.5 h (Note 4). Once addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted to the central neck of the flask. (S)-Phenylglycine (50.0 g, 0.331 mol) (Note 5) is then added to the mixture in small portions (Note 6). After the (S)-phenylglycine has been added, the ice-bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 18 h (Note 7). After this period, the solution removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-bath for 20 min, then 60 mL of methanol is very cautiously added (Note 8). After evolution of gas has ceased, the reaction mixture is diluted with 250 mL of anhydrous THF and triethylamine (48.6 mL, 35.3 g, 0.347 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 9) is added in one portion. With vigorous stirring, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (72.9 g, 0.334 mol, 1.01 equiv) is added portionwise (Note 10), followed by 200 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 11). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 3 h. After this time, the solvents are removed in vacuo (Note 12) and the resulting white solid is suspended in 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 300 mL of water and stirred vigorously. The white residues are dispersed by the gradual addition of 400 mL of a 1:1 solution of 1.2 N aqueous HCl and brine. After being stirred for 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel and is shaken with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are then shaken with a 1:1 solution of 0.6 N HCl and brine (200 mL), followed by a 1:1 solution of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine (200 mL), and finally, water (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (100 g), filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo (Note 12) to leave 100 mL of mother liquor. After addition of 300 mL of hexane, the solution is chilled at \u221220 \u00b0C for 12 h to induce precipitation. The mixture is then filtered through a 90 -mm B\u00fcchner funnel (fitted with 90-mm diameter Whatman 1 filter paper) to obtain crude tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate and the filtrate is kept. The crude product is purified by repeated recrystallization from dichloromethane-cyclohexane (3 crops) (Note 13) to afford 71.1 g (91%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate as white needles after drying in vacuo (Note 12). The clear filtrate kept from each recrystallization is combined, concentrated in vacuo (Note 12), and the resulting mixture (usually an off-white solid or a sticky cream foam) purified by column chromatography (Note 14) yielding a further 2.68 g (3.4%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate after removal of solvents and drying in vacuo (Note 12). Total yield of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate is 73.8 g (94%) obtained as white needles (Note 15).",

The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of methanesulfonyl chloride (6.86 mL, 10.1 g, 0.0885 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 17) and 100 mL of dry dichloromethane, which is then added to the flask dropwise over 1 h. The reaction mixture is stirred at <20 \u00b0C for 12 h (Notes 18, 19), after which time 150 mL of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution are added. After being stirred for a 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined organic phases are then washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 100 mL). After drying the organic phase over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), the solvents are filtered, then are removed in vacuo (Notes 12 and 20) to yield 27.8 g (105%) of an off-white solid that is recrystallized from dichloromethane-hexane (Note 13) to give (2S)-2-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-phenylethyl methanesulfonate (25.0 g, 94%) as a cream powder (Note 21).",

The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow slurry is first taken up in dichloromethane (30 mL) and then is triturated with hexane (200 mL) and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The remaining slurry is treated in the same manner twice more (Note 24). The combined extracts are filtered through a silica plug (ca. 20 g, 3 cm long, 5 cm in diameter), which is washed with 50 mL of hexane. The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The light-yellow liquid residue is purified by column chromatography (Note 25) to afford 11.9 g (88%) of the 6 as a clear colorless liquid (Note 26).",
            "D. (R)-3-Methyl-3-phenylpentene (7).2 The pre-catalyst is prepared as follows in a glove-box: A 100-mL, pear-shaped Schlenk flask with one side-arm fitted with a rubber septum and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with argon. The flask is charged with anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 27) and is transferred into a glove-box (Note 28). To the flask is quickly added [di(\u03bc-bromo)bis(\u03b7-allyl)nickel(II) (180 mg, 0.50 mmol, 0.01 equiv), (R)-2,2'-binaphthoyl-(S,S)-di(1-phenylethyl)aminoylphosphine (539 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 29) and NaBArF24 (886 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) in the order mentioned. The resulting suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a dark-brown solution containing a small amount of fine particles (NaBr).\nA 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a Teflon-taped flow-controlled argon inlet, a thermometer, and a magnetic stir bar is flame-dried and purged with argon. The flask is then charged with 150 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 27). The catalyst solution prepared above, now removed from the drybox, is introduced to the vessel via cannula. The flask containing the catalyst solution is further rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane, and this solution is also transferred to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of pre-catalyst transfer, the system closed at the flow-controlled stopcock and then is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, creating a small vacuum. A strong flow of dry ethylene (Note 30) is introduced through a needle through the serum stopper to relieve the vacuum and then is adjusted to maintain a pressure of 1 atm by releasing excess gas through an oil bubbler. The introduction of the ethylene causes the internal temperature to rise. Within ca. 5 min, the internal temperature increases by 5 \u00b0C and the ethylene line is removed (Note 31). The solution is cooled back to \u221270 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring. A solution of 2-phenyl-1-butene (6) (6.60 g, 50.0 mmol) in 30 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 27) is introduced as a weak stream into the solution of pre-catalyst over a two-minute period via syringe followed by a 10 mL rinse with dichloromethane. Ethylene is introduced again through a needle, first as a strong flow and then regulated to maintain a pressure of 1 atm. Under an ethylene atmosphere, the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is then maintained between \u221265 \u00b0C and \u221270 \u00b0C for a period of 4 h. At the end of this period the ethylene line is removed and the reaction mixture is slowly poured into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 mL of pentane (Note 32) is and combined with a 50-mL pentane rinse of the reaction vessel. After being warmed to ambient temperature, the resulting, cloudy solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (Merck, grade 9385, mesh 230-400, 60 \u00c5, 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm, (d \u00d7 h)), which is eluted with 100 mL of pentane (Note 33). The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 7.99 g (99.7%) of (R)-3-methyl-3-phenylpentene (er 98.8:1.2) as a clear, liquid (Notes 34 and 35)."

            "Although many convenient and reliable precursors of benzyne have been prepared and utilized in organic synthesis,2 a hypervalent iodine-containing molecule, (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2) , has been developed for service as an efficient and mild benzyne precursor. The major developments over the past years have been the improvement of methods of synthesis of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor and the applications to related reactive intermediates. The summary will be reported in this Discussion Addendum.\nImprovement of Hypervalent Iodine Precursor\n2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2 generates benzyne more efficiently than other benzyne precursors such as benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate, o-dihalobenzenes (1,2-bromofluorobenzene and 1,2-dibromobenzene), and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate. The efficiency of this benzyne precursor 2 is attributable to the high leaving group ability of hypervalent iodine groups, which has been discussed previously.3 Hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor 2 was prepared in two steps from inexpensive and commercially available 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Initial preparation of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) by reaction of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Me3SiCl in the presence of Mg and a catalytic amount of I2 in HMPA is followed by transformation into 2 by the reaction with PhI(OAc)2 activated with TfOH in CH2Cl2. However, several drawbacks remained: (1) use of toxic HMPA solvent and severe conditions for the preparation of 1, (2) difficulty for introduction of functional groups, and (3) low solubility of the hypervalent iodine species in most organic solvents.\nTo improve the reaction procedure, an alternative benzyne precursor, 2-(hydroxydimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate (5), has been prepared in three steps starting with 1,2-dibromobenzene.4 This process avoids the use of carcinogenic HMPA and severe reaction conditions (high temperature and long reaction time). The reaction of 5 with Bu4NF under mild conditions generates benzyne efficiently, which provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. Therefore, 5 is a convenient alternative benzyne precursor. Incorporation of synthetically important carbonyl groups into hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors is difficult, because carbonyl groups cannot tolerate Grignard conditions. Synthesis of benzyne precursors bearing the carbonyl groups has been accomplished using pyran-2-ones as starting materials. Reaction of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with methyl 2-pyrone-5-carboxylate or 5-acylpyran-2-ones at 200 \u00b0C in a sealed tube affords the corresponding methyl 3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzoate5 or 1-acyl-3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-benzenes6 in good to high yields, which can be converted to 2-(trimethylsilyl)-phenyliodonium triflates 6, which contain carbonyl groups, by treatment with PhI(OAc)2 and TfOH. Treatment of 6 with Bu4NF in CH2Cl2 generates benzynes that contain ketone functionality, and reaction with furan provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. In general, hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors are stable solids and easy to handle, but they do not dissolve in most organic solvents. To improve the solubility of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, long-chained precursors (7) have been synthesized.7 As the alkyl chain of benzyne precursors 7 is lengthened, the solubility in non-polar organic solvents and the yield of the benzyne adduct with furan gradually increases.\nFigure 1.Improvements of synthetic procedures for hypervalent iodine precursors.\n1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) is the key starting material for the synthesis of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2. Recent improvement on the synthesis of 1 have been reported in which 1,2-dibromobenzene is used instead of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The use of Rieke magnesium or Mg turnings/1,2-dibromoethane8 and Fe-catalyzed DIBAL-H activated Grignard reaction have led to improved reactions.9 Through these variations, severe reaction conditions and the use of toxic HMPA solvent can be avoided.\nFigure 2. Improvements of synthesis of 1.\nOther Applications Using Hypervalent Iodine\nWhen hypervalent iodine and silyl groups are contiguous, fluoride ion can trigger the concerted elimination reaction of these two groups. This method is applicable not only to the generation of benzyne, but also to the generation of reactive intermediates related to benzyne. Thus, 2,3-didehydronaphthalene (8),10 bicycle[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-yne (9),11 dehydro-o-carborene (10),12 2,3-didehydrothiphene (11),13 and 2,3-didehydropyrrole (12)14 have been generated by this method. Benzobisoxadisiloles have been applied to synthesis of hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, which can serve as the synthetic equivalents of 1,4-benzdiyne (13) and related species.15\nFigure 3.

To this homogeneous yellow mixture, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine 2 (4.04 mL, 23.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. As soon has the first drop is added, the reaction mixture quickly changes to a dark reddish-orange color, but the mixture remains homogeneous throughout the addition without detectable exotherm. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (5.31 mL, 30.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise (1-2 min), which results in a slight cloudiness, but no exotherm is detected during or after addition. The flask is closed with a septum (Note 6) and the reaction mixture is stirred in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C. During the warming process, the dark reddish-orange color lightens somewhat, but the mixture remains cloudy. The reaction is stirred for 18 h at 70 \u00b0C after which time the dark reddish-orange reaction mixture is homogeneous. The reaction is judged to be complete by the disappearance of the starting ester by TLC (Note 7). The mixture is cooled to room temperature (Note 8) and de-ionized water (2 mL) is added dropwise with a Pasteur pipette over a period of ca. 2-3 min with efficient stirring while a persistent cloudiness develops. Precipitation/crystallization of the product occurs rapidly after the addition, giving rise to a very thick dark-red suspension (Note 1). After formation of the suspension, water (150 mL) is added in 10 mL portions over a period of ca. 5 min. During the addition of water the mixture becomes slightly warm to the touch. The resulting dark-orange to dark-yellow suspension of product is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h. The solids are collected by suction-filtration on filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with four portions of water (20 - 30 mL each). The solids are allowed to dry for ca. 1-2 h under air suction on the filter funnel. The solids are then collected and placed under vacuum (2 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 7.92-7.98 g (97-98% yield) of a red-orange to dark yellow solid (Note 10) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "B. Ethyl 3-amino-4-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)benzoate (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm). The flask is charged with nitro compound 3 (7.00 g, 18.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and methanol (285 mL) (Note 12). The flask is then fitted with a 3-way gas inlet adapter with an argon-filled balloon attached to one of the arms. While stirring the resultant yellow suspension, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). While stirring under a blanket atmosphere of argon, the adapter on the flask is briefly removed and Pearlman's catalyst (500 mg, (Note 14)) is added as a suspension in methanol (10 mL + 5 mL rinse). The argon balloon is then replaced with another balloon filled with hydrogen gas and, while stirring the mixture, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with hydrogen gas three times (Note 13). The dark yellow-black suspension is allowed to stir under the hydrogen atmosphere for a period of 24 h, after which TLC analysis indicate the disappearance of compound 3 (Note 15). The hydrogen balloon is once again replaced with an argon-filled balloon and the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). The 3-way stopper is then removed, Celite 545(r) (10g) (Note 16) is added and the suspension stirred under the argon blanket for 10 min. The solid is removed by suction filtration over filter paper (Note 17) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with two portions of methanol (20 - 30 mL each). The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 \u00b0C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid (Note 18) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "C. 2-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-1-[2-(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)- ethyl]-1 H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6). A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 19), DMF (30 mL) (Note 20) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) (Note 21) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 \u00b0C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4 (Note 11). The stirred mixture (Note 22) is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) (Note 23) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid (Note 25). The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) (Note 26) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid (Notes (Note 24) and (Note 27)). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper (Note 28) and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 29). The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid (Note 30)."

            "Reductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful methodology primarily because its products are excellent substrates for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Since 2003, the Organic Syntheses article and the primary references have been cited over 100 times. This discussion addendum aims to provide a brief overview of recent developments in this methodology. Improvements and variations of \u03b1-acetoxy ether formation, as well as the synthetic utility of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers will be discussed. Recent applications in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products are also included.\nImprovements and Variations of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ether Formation\nThe original reductive acetylation protocol involves the addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBALH) as a 1.0 M solution in hexanes to the ester at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting aluminum alkoxide is then treated with pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) sequentially. The internal temperature during these additions should not exceed -72 \u00b0C in order to maximize the yield and prevent undesired side reactions.2 While this method is general, recent developments include the use of asymmetric electrophiles in order to generate more complex acyl ethers and the extension of reductive acetylation to lactams and imides.\nShortly after the original article, Rovis and Zhang reported the use of acid fluorides as competent reagents for the trapping of such aluminum alkoxides, the results of which are summarized in Figure 1.3 Aryl, vinyl, and alkyl acid fluorides are all effective trapping reagents (67-97% yield) and steric bulk is well tolerated (pivaloyl fluoride = 92% yield). This development allows access to more complex acyl acetal derivatives without sacrificing a full equivalent of the acid, which represents an improvement in atom economy over the use of symmetric anhydrides.\nFigure 1. Acid Fluorides as Trapping Reagents.\nMore recently, Dalla and co-workers have extended reductive acetylation strategy to the formation of \u03b1-acetoxy pyrrolidines (Figure 2).4 While DIBALH will reduce imides, the resultant aluminum alkoxide is not nucleophilic enough to react with acetic anhydride. Therefore, the reductant of choice for the preparation of \u03b1-acetoxy amines is lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH), whose lithium alkoxide is sufficiently nucleophilic for effective trapping with acetic anhydride.\nFigure 2. Formation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Pyrrolidines.\nA variety of N-alkylated imides, shown in Figure 3, afford \u03b1-acetoxy lactams in high yields (75-100%), with the notable exception of cases where there is \u03b1-branching with respect to the nitrogen substituent (e.g. the imide of \u03b1-methylbenzylamine, MeBn). Steric bulk on the imide also limits the conversion to the \u03b1-acetoxy lactams, as shown by the modest yield for the bis-OTBS imide. Despite these limitations, this reductive acetylation strategy offers rapid entry into N-acylimium ions for use in Mannich reactions.\nFigure 3. \u03b1-Acetoxy Lactams from Imides.\nSynthetic Utility of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nTreatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers with a Lewis acid (commonly BF3\u00b7OEt2, MgBr2\u00b7OEt2, TMSOTf, SnCl4 or TiCl4) results in the formation of an oxocarbenium ion, which can be intercepted by a variety of nucleophiles to afford a new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond adjacent to an ether linkage. The scope of such transformations has been investigated in the context of diastereoselective nucleophilic additions. \u03b1-Acetoxy ethers are also useful substrates for cascade sequences, such as oxonia Cope-Prins and Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclizations. The use of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet Spengler reactions have also been examined.\nThe use of \u03b1-(trimethylsilyl)benzyl alcohol as a chiral auxiliary has been investigated by Rychnovsky and Crossrow for diastereoselective additions to oxocarbenium ions generated from \u03b1-acetoxy ethers.5 This chiral auxiliary was chosen due to the ease of preparation of both enantiomers and facile deprotection or conversion to the benzyl ether. Treatment of the \u03b1-acetoxy ether with a variety of nucleophiles, including allyl silanes, silyl enol ethers, and silyl ketene acetals, in the presence of TMSOTf proceed in high yields (87-98%) and high diastereoselectivities (20:1 to 80:1), as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, (E)-crotyltrimethylsilane affords the syn product in high yield and diastereoselectivity (82%, 27:2.4:1). The addition of cyanide and ethyl nucleophiles proceed in high yields (97% and 75% respectively), albeit with modest diastereoselectivity (5:1 and 4:1).\nFigure 4. Diastereoselective Additions of Nucleophiles.\nRychnovsky and Dalgard have reported on the expedient synthesis of tetrahydropyranones through an oxonia Cope-Prins cyclization.6 This strategy, outlined in Figure 5, involves a reductive acetylation of an ester 1, followed by treatment with TMSOTf to generate oxocarbenium ion 3. The pendant allyl moiety participates in a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to generate oxocarbenium ion 4, which is poised for a Prins cyclization (intramolecular Mukaiyama aldol reaction) with the silyl enol ether to afford tetrahydropyranone 5. This transformation is effective for a variety of substrates (Figure 6) affording the tetrahydropyranone product in high yields (77-99%), including those bearing quaternary centers adjacent to the ketone.\nFigure 5. 2-Oxonia Cope-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 6. Synthesis of Tetrahydropyranones.\nRovis and Epstein have also utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in a cascade sequence to provide 4-amino tetrahydropyrans through a Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclization.7 As shown in Figure 7, treatment of 4-acetoxy-1,3-dioxane 6 with TMSOTf generates oxocarbenium ion 7, which upon treatment with allyl silane affords alkene 8. In the presence of TfOH, acetal cleavage results in formation of oxocarbenium ion 9, which undergoes a Prins cyclization to give carbocation 10. Addition of a nitrile to the carbocation affords 4-amino tetrahydropyran 11 after hydrolysis.\nFigure 7. Sakurai-Ritter-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 8. Synthesis of 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nThe Sakurai-Ritter-Prins reaction is effective for a variety of dioxane derivatives, as shown in Figure 8. This transformation affords the 4-amino tetrahydropyran products in good yields (59-88%) and high diastereoselectivies (90:10 to 99:1). It should be noted that 2-substituted allyl silanes (Figure 9) and a variety of nitriles are effective partners in this transformation.7\nFigure 9. Synthesis of Quaternary 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nJacobsen and Doyle have utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers as substrates in the development of enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet-Spengler reactions (Figure 10).8 An ester derivative of tryptophol was reduced and trapped to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 12. In the presence of a thiourea catalyst 13, TMSCl, and BaO, oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent ring closure afforded tetrahydropyrano-indole 14 in good yield (82%) and good enantiomeric excess (79%).\nFigure 10. Organocatalytic Asymmetric Oxa-Pictet-Spengler Cyclization.\nHighlighted Applications in the Total Synthesis of Complex Natural Products: Intramolecular Allylation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nKadota, Yamamoto and co-workers utilized reductive acetylation to unite two complex fragments in their highly convergent synthesis of marine neurotoxin gambierol (19).9 The strategy, shown in Scheme 1, begins with the coupling of ABC acid to FGH alcohol via Yamaguchi esterification. The resulting ester 15 is then subjected to reductive acetylation conditions. While\nScheme 1. Kadota and Yamamoto's Total Synthesis of Gambierol.\nAc2O is an effective trapping reagent, chloroacetic anhydride provided increased yield and proper diastereoselectivity for the subsequent ring closure. Treatment of the resulting \u03b1-acetoxy ether 16 with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves afforded effective closure of the 6-membered D ring in high yield (87%) and modest diastereoselectivity (2:1) with respect to the acyclic ether. The resulting diene 17 is primed for a ring closing metathesis to forge the 7-membered E ring. The complex polycyclic ether framework 18 was then further elaborated to gambierol (19).\nScheme 2. Kadota's Total Synthesis of Brevenal.\nA similar approach was employed in Kadota and co-worker's total synthesis of the nontoxic brevetoxin antagonist brevenal (23).10 As shown in Scheme 2, the 7-membered D ring arose from the reductive chloroacetylation of ester 20, followed by treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 21 with magnesium bromide etherate and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieves. The resulting oxocarbenium ion was then trapped by the allyl stannane to afford the tetracycle 22 in good yield as a single diastereomer (52% from the ester 20). This cyclization again sets the stage for a ring closing metathesis sequence to afford a pentacycle, which was elaborated to brevenal (23).\nThe authors also reported a second-generation strategy (Scheme 3) where acyclic a0cid 24 is coupled to ABC alcohol 25.10-b This route employs the same reduction/cyclization sequence to forge the E ring in good yield as the single desired diastereomer (57% from the ester 26) and sets up the closure of the D ring in an analogous fashion.\nScheme 3. Kadota's Second Generation Strategy to Brevenal.\nRecently, the total synthesis of ciguatoxin CTX3C (34) by Yamashita and co-workers employed reductive acetylation to facilitate a radical cyclization to give the C ring of tridecacyclic natural product (Scheme 4).11 The AB acid and E alcohol were subjected to Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the ester 29. Following reductive acetylation, \u03b1-acetoxy ether 30 underwent transacetylation in the presence of diisobutylaluminum phenylselenide to afford the \u03b1-seleno ether 31 in high yield (83% from the ester). The \u03b1-seleno ether 31 was carried through 3 steps before C-ring radical cyclization was initiated by triethylborane and oxygen in the presence of tributyltin hydride to provide sulfoxide 33 in good yield as a single diastereomer (86%). This approach offered increased stereoselectivity over a direct allylation strategy (as in gamberiol). Sulfoxide 33 was then carried forward to afford ciguatoxin CTX3C (34).\nReductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful method for the construction of complex cyclic ethers via intramolecular allylation. The strategy has played a key role in the preparation of brevetoxin-like ladder polyethers.12 The method's utility is largely due to the ease with which substrates can be brought together by a Yamaguchi esterification. This protocol allows for a highly convergent and flexible approach to these marine natural products.\nScheme 4. Yamashita's Total Synthesis of Ciguatoxin CTX3C.\nIntermolecular Couplings of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers and Silyl Enol Ethers\nCrimmins and DeBaillie utilized reductive acetylation to install the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety of the tetrahydropyran fragment of the marine cytotoxin bistramide A (38).13 The synthetic strategy is outlined in Scheme 5. The lactone 35 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (7:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 with (E)-3-penten-2-one in the presence of excess TMSOTf led to formation of tetrahydropyran 37, a key building block for the synthesis of bistramide A (38), in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (9:1).\nScheme 5. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Bistramide A.\nRychnovsky and co-workers used a related strategy to construct the western tetrahydropyran fragment of marine cytotoxin leucascandrolide A (43).14 As shown in Scheme 6, the lactone 39 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 in high yield (91%) and high diastereoselectivity (15:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 with silyl enol ether 41 in the presence of catalytic zinc bromide led to formation of tetrahydropyran 42 in high yield (92%) and good diastereoselectivity (20:1). Tetrahydropyran 42 was then further elaborated to leucascandrolide A (43).\nScheme 6. Rychnovsky's Total Synthesis of Leuscandrolide A.\nThe most complex example of such intermolecular couplings comes from Crimmins and co-workers recent synthesis of the cancer cell growth inhibitor (+)-irciniastatin A (48).15 This convergent strategy is outlined in Scheme 7. Reduction of lactone 44 followed by trapping with Ac2O proceeds to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 in quantitative yield. Treatment of the sterically hindered \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 with boron trifluoride etherate followed by a slight excess of the highly functionalized silyl enol ether 46 gave tetrahydropyran 47 in good yield (59%; 85% based on recovered ketone) and high diastereoselectivity (>20:1). Tetrahydropyran 47 was then carried forward to afford (+)-irciniastatin A (48).\nScheme 7. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Irciniastatin A.\nReductive acetylation followed by intermolecular coupling has proven to be a useful strategy for coupling complex fragments in total synthesis.16 The success of this methodology is largely due to the functional group compatibility of the reduction and mild conditions for oxocarbenium ion formation. Furthermore, the coupling itself often proceeds in high yield and high diastereoselectivity. These features validate this method as a highly convergent process in complex natural product synthesis."

After 2 h reaction time, additional DIBAL-H (20.4 mL, 20.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe; after stirring for an additional 1 h, no more starting material is observed by TLC analysis (Note 15). The flask is removed from the cooled bath, and the reaction is then quenched by slow addition of ethyl acetate (150 mL) (Note 16) and 2M HCl (100 mL) (Note 17) over a 10 min period.

            "The olefin metathesis reaction has emerged as a widely used transformation in organic chemistry and materials science.4 In keeping with the theme of our original article, this discussion addendum provides an overview of current large-scale ring-closing metathesis (RCM) applications of the Ru-based family of metathesis catalysts, the structures of which are shown in Figure 1.5\nFigure 1. Commonly Used Olefin Metathesis Catalysts.\nIn our 2003 report for the preparation of N-Boc-3-pyrroline , we utilized 0.5 mol% of catalyst 1 in a refluxing (2.5 h) 0.4 M solution of N-Boc-diallylamine in CH2Cl2. The report also described an extractive method for removing Ru-derived catalytic species/impurities using the water-soluble P(CH2OH)3, readily prepared from a commercially available fire-retardant aqueous formulation of P(CH2OH)4Cl. Following Kugelrohr distillation, this method reliably provided ca. 30 g of crystalline N-Boc-3-pyrroline in 90-94% isolated yield. Concurrent with the development of our procedure, Helmchen reported6 a 100 g preparation of Boc-3-pyrroline using 0.1 mol% of ethylidene 2a in a room-temperature (15 h) 0.57 M CH2Cl2 solution of N-Boc-diallylamine. Catalyst deactivation or removal procedures were not taken and the product was isolated in 98% yield after vacuum distillation. This transformation has also been reported to proceed in 87% yield when run neat and with catalyst 5 loading as low as 500 ppm.7\nSince the time of our report, however, RCM has rapidly matured and has been used to prepare kilogram quantities of structurally complex macrocyclic synthetic intermediates within the pharmaceutical industry. Optimizing a large-scale RCM process requires that several conditions be studied, namely, substrate type and functional group compatibility, catalyst selection, and solvent/temperature/time requirements. In many applications, removal of residual ruthenium is also a concern. In this Discussion Addendum, large-scale industrial RCM processes will be used to frame the relevant issues. These examples include Boehringer-Ingelheim's Hepatitis C protease inhibitor BILN-2061, GlaxoSmithKline's cathepsin \u039a inhibitor SB-462795, and RCM-tethered macrocyclic peptides. The discussion will conclude with an overview of developments in the area of ruthenium removal.\nFigure 2. SB-462795 and BILN-2061 and their RCM disconnections.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the 2006 and 2009 RCM processes for construction of the BILN-2061 peptide macrocycle.\nBoehringer-Ingelheim's 2006 disclosure8,9,10,11,12,13 of a large-scale RCM approach to the hepatitis C viral protease inhibitor BILN-2061 provides an interesting case study for those contemplating a large-scale metathesis process. The BILN-2061 metathesis substrate is an unnatural tripeptide-derived diene, which closes to a (Z)-olefin-containing 15-membered ring. Two of the conformation-restraining amide bonds are endocyclic, and two additional macrocyclic torsional degrees of freedom are fixed by the presence of the five-membered proline ring and an endocyclic trans-cyclopropane. The optimized 2006 RCM process (Figure 3) was scaled up to produce >400 kg of cyclized product.10 Three years later, the BI group reported a higher-yielding and order-of-magnitude greener procedure, one which dramatically reduced the amount of time, solvent, and catalyst loading.13\nThe first efforts to construct the BILN-2061 macrocycle used catalyst 1.9 These trials were met with problematic epimerization at the \u03b2-carbon of the vinylcyclopropyl amino acid residue (Figure 4). When a mono-phosphine catalyst such as 3 was used, the epimerization reaction was not observed. Analysis of model systems revealed that the rearrangement was facile when the bis-phosphine catalyst 1 was used. The rearrangement could also be promoted by adding one equivalent of phosphine to a mixture of catalyst 3 and the model system (Figure 4). The origin of this rearrangement was suggested to occur via the intermediacy of bis-phosphino or amino phosphino ruthenacyclopentene intermediates.9,11 Further studies revealed that the site of catalyst initiation in the macrocycle precursor depended upon the substitution of the aminocylopropylcarboxylic acid nitrogen atom: acyl-type substituents such as N-Boc shifted the initiation to the rearrangement-stable nonenoic residue (Figure 4).12 Before this detail was known, the reasonably efficient 2006 process using diene 7 and catalyst 3 was plagued by problematic batch inconsistencies. Traces of morpholine (<20 ppm) in the toluene solvent were shown to be responsible for substrate isomerization and catalyst inhibition, with the former arising from bis-ligated Ru species of the type discussed earlier. These problems were alleviated by acid-washing the solvent prior to the metathesis reaction.\nFigure 4. Catalyst-specific epimerization observed in RCM reactions of BILN-2061 substrates, suggested ruthenacyclopentene intermediates, and the effect of N-Boc substitution on site of catalyst initiation.\nThe aminocyclopropyl metathesis rearrangement encountered by the BI group was unexpected and highly substrate-specific. The most common side reactions in metathesis processes are alkene isomerization reactions.14 Because of the reversible nature of olefin metathesis, isomerization can alter unreacted starting material or products. It can be problematic in reactions where the catalyst is stressed by temperature or time or in some product purifications involving direct distillation from Ru-containing pot residues.15 For example, ring closure of diallyl ether 19 to 20 with catalyst 4 (Figure 5) is a rapid reaction, but significant product isomerization to vinyl ether 21 can occur at extended reaction times. Rearrangement is thought to arise from Ru-H species; it can be suppressed by solvent selection16,17 or by additives such as tricyclohexylphosphine oxide,18 acetic acid or 1,4-benzoquinones,19 phenylphosphoric acid,20 chlorocatechol borane,21 or Cy2BCl.22\nFigure 5. Select rearrangements observed in Ru-catalyzed metathesis reactions.\nRearrangement chemistry is the desired outcome in some applications. For example, Ru-catalyzed rearrangements are used for selective O-allyl23 and N-allyl24 deprotections. The latter, an allylamine to enamine transformation, was observed in lactam-piperidone 22 when treated with catalyst 1 in refluxing toluene (Figure 5). Olefin migration can also occur in hydrocarbon chains. For example, attempts to ring-close cyclopentanone-derived diene 25 with catalyst 4 did not return the [9.5.0] ring system.25 Instead, the monosubstituted double bond was found to migrate at a rate faster than 9- or 8-membered ring closure, leading to exclusive generation of the [7.5.0] product 26. Another strategy purposefully adds a hydride source to promote rearrangement after ring closure. For example, enol ether 28 is formed in 82% yield by first performing an RCM reaction on diene 27 to form the seven-membered ring product, which is then isomerized in a second step involving addition of NaBH4 to the Ru-containing reaction mixture.26\nNon-metathesis side reactions have also been reported in the context of Ru-promoted metathesis reactions. Hoye and Zhao have reported fragmentation reactions in RCM substrates containing secondary allylic alcohols; in sluggish metathesis reactions these systems can fragment to the methyl ketone.27 Kharasch additions of CHCl3 to olefins, as catalyzed by 1 at 65 \u00b0C, are also known.28\nAlthough the problem of isomerization was largely solved and the RCM reaction was utilized at kg scale, the 2006 BILN-2061 process suffered from several other drawbacks. The first of these was the dilute substrate concentration (0.014 M), which required excessive solvent consumption. A study of the macrocyclization behavior of different acyclic dienes and dimeric intermediates revealed a 27-fold improvement in the effective molarity (EM) of cyclization, which translated to a 0.2 M RCM process.12 A significant shortening of the reaction time was also realized. As mentioned earlier, an N-Boc group at the vinylcyclopropane amide residue was found to productively shift the site of catalyst initiation and led to a more facile and robust ring-closing reaction. While adding protection-deprotection steps, the improved 2009 process could therefore be run at higher concentrations and temperatures and with lower catalyst loadings (0.1 mol% 6 vs. 3 mol% 3). Each of these factors contributed in a positive manner to the EM of cyclization. Although the details will not be considered here, one of the principle steps in optimizing the BILN-2061 macrocyclization was defining conditions which (i) minimized formation of dimeric compounds arising from acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) processes,29,30 and (ii) one in which these oligomers could be equilibrated to product.\nThe BILN-2061 RCM reaction optimization is best viewed in terms of green chemistry considerations. The 2009 process13 represented a significant savings in terms of time, energy, and material. The RCM step was reduced to minutes instead of hours. Scrupulous degassing and solvent purification was necessary for the 2006 process, whereas the new process only required a brief degassing boil-out. The 2006 RCM process required as much as 150,000 L solvent per metric ton of diene, whereas the 2009 process reduced this amount to 7,500 L/MT. Because catalyst loading was greatly reduced in the 2009 process, Ru removal was likewise less resource-intensive. The 2006 process used excess 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (2 kg/1 kg diene) and aqueous bicarbonate to remove a portion of the soluble ruthenium, with subsequent silica gel and charcoal filtrations necessary to reduce Ru levels to 10 ppm in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In contrast, the 2009 process used 50-fold less 2-mercaptonicotinic acid and did not utilize silica or charcoal filtrations. The Sheldon E-factor,31 which is the ratio of waste mass to product mass, improved to 52 (computed for the 2009 Boc protection/RCM/Boc deprotection process) from 370 (computed for the 2006 RCM process).\nLarge-scale RCM was also used in GlaxoSmithKline's 2009 synthesis of the seven-membered azapane ring in cathepsin K inhibitor SB-462795 (Figure 6).32 The metathesis step in this synthesis also required multiple optimization attempts. Initial efforts using diene 29 and catalyst 5 were stymied by the need for high catalyst loadings (5-10 mol%). Substrate-catalyst coordination was suspected to be the source of the problem, but reactions using Ti(O-iPr)4 as a chelation inhibitor33,34 were not successful due to substrate/product decomposition. Additionally, large residual Ru levels were deemed a safety hazard with downstream steps involving H2O2 (for chiral auxiliary removal) and an acyl azide (for nitrogen insertion via Curtius rearrangement). To complicate matters, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone RCM product 30 decomposed via a retro-aldol reaction when the basic P(CH2OH)3/NaOH ruthenium removal procedure was employed. These setbacks led to the design of N/O-protected RCM precursor 31. This substrate closed with lower catalyst loadings (1-2 mol%) but gave capricious levels of olefin migration when attempted with crude product coming out of a Curtius rearrangement employing hydrazine and t-butyl nitrite/HCl (Figure 6). Solvent swaps or isomerization inhibitors (acetic acid, styrene, or Cy3PO) did not suppress the isomerization. The RCM process was made tractable by purifying precursor diene 31 as the HCl salt. When converted to the free base, it reliably provided 32 as a crystalline product in 90% yield using 1-2 mol% of catalyst 5. A basic cysteine wash was used to remove Ru; this thiol-based approach was utilized after it was discovered that (i) formaldehyde, generated during in situ generation of P(CH2OH)3, added to the carbamate nitrogen of product 32 to form hydroxymethylated 35, and (ii) residual P reagents proved problematic for subsequent olefin hydrogenation.\nFigure 6. Selected RCM reactions used in the synthesis of SB-462795.\nAn alternative route to SB-462795 employed RCM precursor 36 containing a phthalimide-protected trans-1,2-aminoalcohol moiety. In comparison with diene 31, this substrate offered a significant improvement in the RCM process, although here again significant optimization efforts were directed at identifying and minimizing trace impurity catalyst inhibitors.35 Highly purified material could be closed in quantitative yields with as little as 0.25-0.5 mol% catalyst 5. Olefin migration was not observed, even in reactions using crude material. When conducted in toluene, the product readily crystallized and provided material with low residual Ru content after the slurry was washed with P(CH2OH)3/NaHCO3.36 According to the published account, both approaches were amenable to large-scale manufacturing and the trans-1,2-aminoalcohol route was used to provide over 200 kg of SB-462795.\nOther publicly disclosed pharmaceutical applications of RCM involve its use to conformationally constrain37,38,39 and alter the metabolic profile of helical peptides by forming peptide macrocycles.40 Scale-up aspects of this chemistry remain proprietary, but much of the exploratory work has been on solid support,41 with microwave-assisted RCM macrocyclizations.42,43 Many examples undergo efficient RCM reactions, and in a solution-phase study of minimal RCM constraints in 310-helical peptides, it was found that high E-selectivity could be realized in an unoptimized 18-membered macrocyclization (38\u219239, Figure 7) catalyzed by 5-7 mol% 4 in refluxing dichloromethane.44\nFigure 7. Representative helical peptide macrocyclization and work-up procedures.\nThe reactions shown in Figure 7 highlight two additional methods for post-RCM reaction processing: (i) the use of ethyl vinyl ether as a Ru catalyst poison (by formation of the stable Fischer carbene) prior to evaporation and silica gel chromatography (SGC), and (ii) a Ru removal procedure utilizing the commercially available, albeit expensive, tris(hydroxymethyl)-phosphine.15,45\nThe BI and GSK investigations show that large-scale RCM reactions can require significant optimization. It is expected that these paths will shorten as more applications are reported. These two examples reveal that at-scale process applications can utilize as little as 0.1-0.5 mol % Ru catalyst, which minimizes the waste stream and is in accord with sustainable green chemistry practice. Sustainable concepts in olefin metathesis have been reviewed elsewhere.46 Pharmaceutical applications require that the API contain <10 ppm metal, and the two industrial examples discussed here utilized water-solubilizing procedures using 2-mercaptonicotinic acid,13 cysteine,32 or tris(hydroxy-methyl)phosphine.36 Downstream processes such as hydrogenation over charcoal-based catalysts can also be used to reduce Ru levels to <1 ppm.35 Other approaches to remove Ru include amine-functionalized mesoporous silicates,47 polar isocyanides,48 lead tetraacetate,49 activated carbon/silica gel,50 and DMSO or triphenylphosphine oxide treatment of crude reaction mixtures.51 DMSO/DMF mixtures have been used to remove colored Ru impurities in solid-phase RCM applications.52 A recent report describes the use of 15% aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an efficient Ru removal agent; this process also oxidizes residual phosphine and carbene ligands to more polar entities, thus easing purification in some cases.53"

            "2,4-Dichloroquinoline (1). A 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask was equipped with a teflon-coated, oval-shaped stir bar (41 \u00d7 17 mm) and charged with malonic acid (26.0 g, 250 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 1)).2 A rubber septum was connected to one of the side necks and a condenser is attached to the middle neck. That condenser was equipped with a line that runs to an HCl trap ((Note 2)). The flask was lowered into an ice water bath and POCl3 (100 mL) was poured into the open neck. The open neck was sealed with a rubber septum. A slight flow of nitrogen gas was introduced into the system through a needle (16 gauge) inserted into one of the side neck septa (Note 3). Stirring was initiated at 300 rpm. Aniline (22.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) was added slowly to the stirring mixture by syringe through a side neck septum over a period of 20 min (Note 4). The flask was then removed from the ice water bath, allowed to stir for 10 min, placed into an oil bath (~110 \u00b0C). and the mixture was stirred for 6 h (Note 5). The flask was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool for 5 min without stirring (Note 6). The mixture was slowly and carefully poured onto crushed ice (~ 1 L) in a 2 L beaker while intermittently stirring with a spatula. The residual material in the 3-neck round-bottomed flask was removed by carefully adding water (100 mL) to the flask and scraping out with a spatula. The aqueous mixture was triturated by vigorous stirring with the spatula (Note 7). The 2 L quench beaker was placed into a bucket of ice. Aqueous NaOH (6 M, 475 mL) was added slowly (over a period of 25 min, maintaining the temperature \u2264 50 \u00b0C) while intermittently stirring (Note 8). The beaker was removed from the ice bath and the suspension was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and age with stirring (77 \u00d7 13 mm stir bar, ~100 rpm) for 12 h (Note 9). The pH of the supernatant was ~7. The suspension was then vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (12.5 cm diameter). Water (150 mL) was used to rinse the residual material from the beaker. The filtered orange-red solid was rinsed with water (150 mL) on the filter. After thoroughly air-drying on the filter (> 1 h), the solid was transferred into 2 cellulose thimbles (43 mm \u00d7 123 mm, int. diam. x ext. length). The contents of each thimble were subjected to a Soxhlet extraction with hexaness (300 mL, (Note 10)) for 16 h. The combined extracts were concentrated (Note 10) by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to leave a yellow solid (13.9\u201314.6 g, 28\u201329%, Notes (Note 11) and (Note 12)) that was used in step B without further purification (Note 13).",
            "H,4ClQuin-BAM (2). A 100 mL, round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a teflon-coated oval stir bar (32 \u00d7 15 mm), rubber septum and an inlet needle connected to an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 16) was first charged with (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1.63 g, 14.3 mmol, 1 equiv, Notes (Note 17) and (Note 18)). Then, Pd(dba)2 (164 mg, 285 \u03bcmol, 0.02 equiv), rac-BINAP (356 mg, 572 \u03bcmol, 0.04 equiv), 2,4-dichloroquinoline (1) (5.66 g, 28.6 mmol, 2 equiv) and sodium tert-butoxide (4.12 g, 42.9 mmol, 3 equiv, (Note 19)) were added. The reaction vessel was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times, then left under a positive pressure of argon.3 Toluene (35 mL) was dispensed into the flask, and the resulting red-brown solution was placed into an oil bath heated to 80 \u00b0C with stirring (Notes (Note 20) and (Note 21), Caution: possible exotherm!). The reaction was monitored by TLC (Note 22); after 1.5 h, nearly complete conversion was observed. The reaction was cooled to 25 \u00b0C, and saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added to the flask. The suspension was stirred for 5 min and cooled to 0 \u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (9 cm diameter) and washed with water (50 mL) and hexaness (150 mL) to afford a light yellow solid. This crude solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 100 mL round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 joint and dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for at least 10 h to leave 4.57-4.80 g of a light beige-yellow solid (73-77%) (Note 23), which was used in step C without further purification.",
            "H,4PyrrolidineQuin-BAM (PBAM) (3). A 10-20 mL microwave vial equipped with an oval stir bar (12 \u00d7 8 mm) was charged with H,4ClQuin-BAM (2) (4.30 g, 9.83 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 24)), pyrrolidine (3.23 mL, 39.3 mmol, 4 equiv) and trifluorotoluene (3.3 mL) (Note 25). The vial was sealed, and this suspension was heated with stirring in the microwave at 170 \u00b0C for 3 min, then at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27), Caution: exothermic!). The reaction mixture was diluted and transferred with 20 mL of dichloromethane to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask for evaporation (Note 28). The reaction was then concentrated by rotary evaporation (80 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg), redissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel, and washed with aqueous NaOH (3 M, 50 mL) and water (4 \u00d7 50 mL). The resulting organic layer was dispensed into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried (MgSO4, 2 g). The solution was filtered (flask and filter were rinsed with an extra 25 mL of dichloromethane) into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h) to provide a light brown powder (Note 29).\nAs much of the material as possible was transferred as a solid from the round-bottomed flask to a pre-weighed 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The remaining solid was dissolved and transferred into a 25-mL pear-shaped flask with 10 mL of dichloromethane and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h). This material was then added to the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The material was dissolved in a 90:10 mixture of acetone and toluene (20 mL/g crude product) with heating in a water bath (70 \u00b0C) (Note 30). The solution was removed from heat and placed on the bench for 1 hour to cool to room temperature. The flask was placed in an ice bath for 3 h or until no further crystallization was observed. The mother liquor was carefully decanted, leaving crystals that were washed with ice-cold acetone (2 \u00d7 10 mL). Residual solvent was removed from the crystals by placing the flask under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for a period of 5-10 min (Note 31). The crystalline material was transferred to a pre-weighed 20 mL glass scintillation vial and dried for ~14 h in a drying pistol (0.21 mmHg) over refluxing toluene. The vial was temporarily removed from the drying pistol, and the material was thoroughly pulverized with a spatula and returned to the drying pistol for an 6 additional 6 h. The dried material was a white cream colored powder (3.08-3.54 g, 62-71% yield) (Notes (Note 32) and (Note 33))."

The apparatus is placed under high vacuum (< 1 mmHg) and allowed to cool to room temperature and subsequently maintained under a positive pressure of N2 using needle inlet through the septum on the rightmost neck. Upon cooling, a thermometer is attached to the center neck using a Teflon adapter, and the apparatus is again evacuated under high vacuum. It is then placed under a positive pressure of N2 and charged with 40.0 mL of toluene (Note 1), then cooled in a -15 \u00b0C acetone bath (Note 2).

            "Nugent's morpholinoisoborneol (MIB) is an excellent ligand for the catalytic asymmetric addition of alkyl, vinyl, and aryl groups to aldehydes in the presence of organozinc reagents to furnish a variety of secondary alcohols with high ee.3,4,5 The major developments have been the significant broadening of the substrate scope and the development of several one-pot methods that streamline the synthesis of synthetically valuable and versatile molecules such as epoxy alcohols, allylic epoxy alcohols, cyclopropyl alcohols, halocyclopropyl alcohols, pyranones and 1,2,4-trioxanes with high enantio-, diastereo-, and chemoselectivity.6,7,8 In this update, we will summarize many of the advances.\nA detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of (-)-MIB has been published in Organic Syntheses.9 Starting from either (R)- or (S)-camphor, gram quantities of either enantiomer of MIB can be synthesized in three steps and with only a single purification step. At the time of this report, only (-)-MIB is commercially available.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Arylation of Aldehydes\nTwo routes for the catalytic asymmetric arylation of aldehydes to generate highly enantioenriched diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were reported (Figure 1).10 In the first route, diarylzinc intermediates were generated in situ by metalation of unfunctionalized aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by transmetalation with ZnCl2 (Figure 1A). The LiCl formed in the process catalyzes a rapid racemic background reaction. The Lewis acidic LiCl was selectively suppressed by addition of tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB and aldehyde to the preformed diarylzinc reagent gave addition products with high enantioselectivities (80-92%) and yields (78-99%). In the second route, mixed alkyl aryl zinc reagents were generated by metalation of aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by addition to ZnCl2 and subsequent addition of a second equivalent of n-BuLi. The mixed organozinc species was used in situ in the asymmetric addition reaction after addition of 0.8 equivalents of TEEDA (Figure 1B). Higher enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were achieved via this route. This methodology was extended to the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl- and diheteroarylmethanols with high levels of enantioselectivity.11\nFigure 1. Catalytic asymmetric aryl additions to aldehydes with (A) Ar2Zn and (B) ArZnBu from aryl bromides.\nCharette and coworkers introduced a complementary catalytic asymmetric arylation method by developing a salt-free preparation of diorganozinc reagents using Zn(OMe)2 and alkyl/aryl Grignard reagents (Figure 2).12 The insoluble salts Mg(OMe)2 and/or NaBr salts were removed by centrifugation or filtration to afford the salt-free diorganozinc reagents. Two examples highlighting the efficiency of this chemistry are illustrated in Figure 2. Ishihara and coworkers adopted Charette's method to synthesize salt-free i-Pr2Zn and subsequently added it to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB with up to 94% ee.13,14\nFigure 2. Charette's catalytic asymmetric (A) alkyl and (B) aryl additions.\n2. Synthesis of Chiral Acyclic Epoxy Alcohols\nIn an effort to streamline the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of valuable small molecules,6 the (-)-MIB-based organozinc catalyzed carbonyl addition step was merged with several other transformations such as epoxidation, cyclopropanation, halocyclopropanation, and various rearrangement reactions. The first tandem reaction developed was for the synthesis of chiral epoxy alcohols.\nFigure 3. Three one-pot synthesis of epoxy alcohols.\nTwo complementary methods were developed for one-pot synthesis of highly enantio- and diastereoenriched epoxy alcohols with up to three contiguous stereocenters.15,16,17 The first route involved highly enantioselective alkyl additions to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes followed by titanium-catalyzed diastereoselective epoxidation with either dioxygen or TBHP (Figure 3A). The second route involves highly enantioselective divinylzinc additions to aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes (Figure 3B). The vinylzinc reagents can be either isolated and purified prior to addition to aldehydes,18,19 or formed in situ by hydroboration of a terminal alkyne followed by transmetalation to zinc (Figure 3C).20 The latter method provided access to a synthetically challenging class of secondary trans-disubstituted epoxy alcohols with up to 4.5 : 1 dr. Excellent enantioselectivities were obtained with a wide range of aldehyde substitution patterns, except unbranched aldehydes, which undergo additions with up to 85% ee. This alkoxide-based titanium epoxidation catalyst is unique in that the same catalyst demonstrated high diastereoselectivity with allylic alkoxides exhibiting either A1,2 or A1,3 allylic strain in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states.\nSynthesis of Chiral Allylic Epoxy Alcohols\nAsymmetric vinylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of MIB generated unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide intermediates. In situ alkoxide directed epoxidation afforded densely functionalized allylic epoxy alcohols in good yields and excellent chemo-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity (Figure 4).16 The vinylzinc reagents may be either prepared and purified (Figure 4A) or generated in situ using Oppolzer's procedure.20\nFigure 4. Synthesis of allylic epoxy alcohols using (A) purified vinylzinc reagents, or (B) in situ generated vinylzinc reagents.\nThe latter procedure afforded only (E)-disubstituted vinylzinc reagents whereas the former allowed for more substituted vinylzinc reagents. The enal must bear non-hydrogen substituents in the R2 or R3 position so that either A1,2 or A1,3 strain is present in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states. The unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide then underwent a highly chemoselective directed epoxidation of the more electron-rich double bond while minimizing A1,2 or A1,3 strain.\nCatalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes\nThe vinylation procedures above provide (E)-allylic alcohols. Walsh and coworkers developed catalytic asymmetric (Z)-vinylation of aldehydes with (Z)-vinylzinc reagents via a novel 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence.21,22 Thus, hydroboration of 1-halo-1-alkynes followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium,23 transmetalation of the resulting (Z)-vinylboranes to zinc and addition to prochiral aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB and the diamine inhibitor TEEDA furnished (Z)-disubstituted allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity and without contamination by (E)-allylic alcohols (Scheme 1). This transformation is analogous to a net trans hydroboration of the corresponding alkynes. Aliphatic aldehydes with \u03b1-branching gave products of high enantiopurity whereas \u03b2-branched aldehydes gave lower enantioselectivities.\nScheme 1. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (Z)-allylic alcohols.\n4.1 Tandem Catalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes/Diastereoselective Epoxidation and Cyclopropanation\nThe generation and addition of (Z)-vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes were then applied to two one-pot tandem reactions. In the first tandem reaction, the resulting allylic alkoxides were treated with Et2Zn, TBHP, and Ti(Oi-Pr)4 to perform the diastereoselective and/or chemoselective epoxidation to synthesize epoxy alcohols and (Z)-allylic epoxy alcohols (Figure 5A).21 In the second tandem reaction, the allylic alkoxides were subjected to 5 equiv each of CF3CH2OH, Et2Zn, and CH2I2 to provide highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols (Figure 5B).24 A variety of 1-chloro-1-alkynes and aldehydes (saturated, aromatic, and heteroaromatic) were employed successfully in these tandem reactions.\nFigure 5. Tandem syntheses of (A) epoxy and allylic epoxy alcohols and (B) syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols.\n4.2 Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis (Z)-Trisubstituted Allylic Alcohols\nThe (Z)-vinyl zinc reagents generated were all disubstituted because the 1,2-metalate rearrangement was executed with a hydride source. A variant of the 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence for the stereospecific generation of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents was also developed.25 Hydroboration of 1-bromo-1-hexyne with either diethyl- or dicyclohexylborane followed by 3 equiv of diethylzinc provided the (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents. The dialkylzinc served a two-fold function: it induced a 1,2-metalate shift to form the new C-C bond and promoted the boron to zinc transmetallation. In the presence of TMEDA (to inhibit the zinc halide by-product) and catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB, these reagents were then employed in the catalytic asymmetric addition of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish enantioenriched (Z)-trisubsituted allylic alcohols in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, this procedure could not be adapted to the highly enantioselective synthesis of \u03b1-methyl-substituted allylic alcohols despite screening several additives (ee <30%, 15-50% yield).\nScheme 2. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1-ethyl and \u03b1-cyclohexyl (Z)-trisubstituted allylic alcohols.\nTandem Catalytic Asymmetric Addition/Diastereoselective Cyclopropanation\n5.1. Synthesis of syn-Cyclopropyl Alcohols. Two tandem routes have been developed to synthesize highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.26 The first route involved enantioselective alkyl addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB (Figure 6A) whereas the second route involved addition of vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish the allylic alkoxide intermediates (Figure 6B). After removal of the volatile materials, the intermediate allylic alkoxide was exposed to either EtZnCH2I or the more reactive CF3CH2OZnCH2I27 to furnish syn-cyclopropyl alcohols with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The first route has a broader substrate scope, but is more challenging because unsaturated aldehydes isomerize readily. The second route provides only (E)-disubstituted syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.\nFigure 6. Tandem asymmetric A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation and B) vinylation of aldehydes followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.2. Synthesis of Enantioenriched Dienols and syn-Vinylcyclopropanes\nThe catalytic enantioselective vinylation was extended to addition of dienyl groups to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB.24 The requisite dienyl zinc intermediates were synthesized via chemo- and regioselective hydroboration of enynes followed by transmetallation with diethylzinc. Dienols were obtained in 79-93% yield and 76-94% ee (Figure 7A).\nThis methodology was further extended to the synthesis of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The dienylzinc alkoxide intermediates were subjected to EtZnCH2I to provide vinyl cyclopropanes with high chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Figure 7B). The alkoxide directed cyclopropanation of allylic C=C bonds is faster than remote C=C bonds.28 A limitation of this method is that aromatic aldehydes were unsuccessful coupling partners.\nFigure 7. Asymmetric dienylation and diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.3. Synthesis of anti-Cyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe inherent bias for syn-selectivity in the alkoxide directed cyclopropanation could be switched to synthesize anti-cyclopropyl alcohols using a strategy developed by Charette and coworkers29 wherein allylic alcohols were protected with bulky silyl groups to prevent coordination to zinc carbenoids. In our method for the synthesis of anti-cyclopropanes,19 we silylated the intermediate zinc alkoxide in situ with TMSCl/Et3N and then subjected the silyl ether to cyclopropanation conditions. The cyclopropyl zinc alkoxides were desilylated in situ to furnish anti-cyclopropyl alcohols in 60-82% yield with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3). The Et3N is likely necessary to break up the zinc aggregates, rendering the zinc alkoxides more nucleophilic towards TMSCl.\nScheme 3. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of anti-cyclopropyl alcohols.\n5.4. Synthesis of syn-Halocyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe catalytic enantio- and diastereoselective tandem generation of cyclopropyl alcohols was extended to the synthesis of halo-substituted cyclopropyl alcohols.26,30 The enantioenriched zinc alkoxide intermediate was subjected to Et2Zn, CF3CH2OH, and either iodoform, bromoform or dichlorobromomethane to furnish iodo-, bromo- or chlorocyclopropyl alcohols respectively in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Figure 8A). In these one-pot tandem halocyclopropanation reactions, four consecutive stereogenic centers are established with excellent diastereoselectivity starting from simple achiral \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde precursors. Interrogation of the cyclopropyl stereochemistry via 1H NMR and X-ray analyses led to an interesting find; when R4 = alkyl or H, the halo group was cis to the carbinol, whereas when R4 = Ph, the halo group was trans. This switch in stereochemical bias was rationalized by invoking a zinc-phenyl-p interaction.31\nA complementary approach to iodocyclopropyl alcohols was developed using MIB-catalyzed asymmetric vinyl addition as the first step followed by subjection of the zinc alkoxide intermediate to 3 equiv of Zn(CHI2)2 (Figure 8B).30 The iodocyclopropyl alcohols can be further allylated with allyl/methallyl bromide in the presence of LiCu(n-Bu)2 to furnish 1,2,3-disubstituted cyclopropanes in good yields as single diastereomers with full retention of the cyclopropane stereochemistry (not shown).\nFigure 8. Tandem asymmetric (A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective halocyclopropanations and (B) vinyl addition to aldehydes followed by diastereoselective iodocyclopropanation.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Aminovinylation of Aldehydes: Synthesis of \u03b2-Hydroxyenamines, \u03b2-Aminoalcohols, and syn-Aminocyclopropyl Alcohols\nRegioselective hydroboration of ynamides followed by boron to zinc transmetallation and subsequent addition to aldehydes in the presence of 5 mol % (-)-MIB furnished \u03b2-hydroxyenamines in moderate yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee, Figure 9A).32\nA tandem catalytic asymmetric aminovinylation/diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction was developed to synthesize syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols with excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1) in moderate yields (Figure 9B).32\nFigure 9. A) Synthesis of \u03b2-hydroxyenamines and B) tandem synthesis of syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Ethoxyvinylation of Aldehydes\nHighly enantioselective addition of ethoxyvinyl zinc reagents, generated via hydroboration of ethoxyacetylene followed by in situ transmetalation to zinc and addition to aldehydes in presence of MIB afforded hydroxyenol ethers with high ee (89-95%) and yields (>93%, Scheme 4).33 Subsequent hydrolysis generated two carbon homologated enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes. In the case of addition to chiral \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes, mismatched and matched catalyst-substrate combinations can be used to achieve moderate to good diastereoselectivities of either the syn- (up to 3.8:1 with (-)-MIB) or anti-diols (>9:1 with (+)-MIB).\nScheme 4. One-pot tandem catalytic asymmetric ethoxyvinylation of aldehydes.\nOther uses of MIB in Organic Synthesis\n8.1. Synthesis of \u03b3Unsaturated \u03b2-Amino Acid Derivatives\nA catalytic enantioselective synthesis of \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives was achieved in three steps from trityl protected 1-butyne-3-ol.34 The enantioenriched allylic alcohols were transformed into the corresponding allylic amines via a [3,3]-sigmatropic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, and led to \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives with high ee after a one-pot deprotection-oxidation sequence (Scheme 5). Similar [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions were executed to access enantioenriched allylic amines en route to the syntheses of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (Figure 10).35,36\nScheme 5.

[3,3]-Sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions en route to the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D.\n8.2. Synthesis of Di(allyl) Ether Derivatives\nNelson and coworkers added Et2Zn to conjugated enals in the presence of MIB followed by O-allylation of the enantioenriched zinc alkoxides to provide di(allyl) ethers in good yields (73-87%) and high ee (88-98%).37,38,39 Subsequent olefin isomerization and Claisen rearrangement provided access to a variety of enantio- and diastereoenriched Claisen adducts (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6.

One-pot Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyranones\nEnantioenriched pyranones with >90% ee were prepared via a one-pot tandem asymmetric alkylation of 2-furfurals in the presence of catalytic (-)-MIB followed by oxidation with NBS (Scheme 7).40\nScheme 7. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched pyranones.\n8.4. Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched 1,2,4- Trioxanes\nEnantioenriched allylic alcohols can be subjected to a hydroxyl directed regio- and diastereoselective photooxygenation reaction with O2 in the presence of tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) to obtain allylic hydroperoxides in >10:1 dr, with the threo-isomer as the major product (Scheme 8).41 The allylic hydroperoxides were further reacted with cyclic ketones in the presence of catalytic p-TsOH to yield enantioenriched 1,2,4-trioxanes (16-78% yield) that exhibited antimalarial activity.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroperoxy alcohols and 1,2,4-trioxanes.\n8.5. Polystyrene-supported MIB-derived Ligands\nPericas and coworkers have successfully synthesized and immobilized 3-exopiperazinoisoborneol (PIB), a close analog of MIB, to Merrifield resins (Scheme 9).42 Polystyrene-supported PIB possessed high catalytic activity and improved chemical stability, and was employed as a ligand (10 mol %) in the asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes with Et2Zn in batch methods to produce highly enantioenriched alcohols in good yields (50-92% y, 92-99% ee). This method is amenable to continuous flow methods for over 30 h with high conversion and no erosion in enantioselectivity. In this fashion, industrial scale amounts (13.0 g) of enantiopure alcohol were isolated in a single continuous flow operation leading to >30 fold better performance compared to batch conditions (TON = 251 with respect to the product).\nScheme 9. Synthesis of polystyrene-supported PIB\n8.6. MIB in Syntheses of Natural Products\nOver the years, MIB has been employed in the synthesis of a number of natural products. In all of these syntheses, MIB has been primarily used in asymmetric alkylation or vinylation reactions to provide diastereo- and enantioenriched alcohols.35,36,41,43,44 In their formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A, Hong and coworkers employed (-)-MIB in the diastereoselective vinylation of a chiral aldehyde to furnish the requisite allylic alcohol with >32:1 diastereoselectivity (Figure 11).44 The enantio- and diastereoselective addition step can be further coupled with efficient transformations en route to synthesis of natural products. As outlined earlier, a [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reaction was employed in the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (jaspine B) (Figure 10)35,36 while a diastereoselective Schenk ene reaction with singlet oxygen was utilized in the synthesis of artemisin-type 1,2,4-trioxanes (Scheme 8).41 It is hopeful that synthetic chemists will adopt the tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations reactions presented herein in efficient synthesis of their natural products.\nFigure 11. Hong and coworkers diastereoselective vinyl carbonyl addition in the formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A.\nBoth Nugent's (+)- and (-)-MIB have found significant synthetic utility as a ligand of choice for addition of organozinc groups to carbonyl compounds. The efficient installation of chirality, coupled with tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations, provides high-value added building blocks that augment the synthetic organic chemist's repertoire of enantioenriched small molecules."

A 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) is equipped with a reflux condenser and two rubber septa (Note 1). The top of the condenser is fitted with a stopcock connected to a vacuum line with an argon flow. Magnesium turnings (7.2 g, 0.3 mol, 1.2 equiv) are added and the apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum. After cooling to room temperature under an argon purge, the flask is charged with diethyl ether (100 mL) and equipped with a thermometer. 1,2-Dibromoethane (0.5 mL) (Note 2) is added to initiate the reaction with a slight increase of the internal temperature (2-3 \u00b0C). Benzyl bromide (30 mL, 0.25 mol) (Note 2) is injected into the mixture with a syringe pump at a rate so as to maintain a gentle reflux (15 mL/h). After the addition, the mixture is heated under reflux with an oil bath (oil bath temperature, 55 \u00b0C) for another 2 h. Another 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) (Note 1) is fitted with two rubber stoppers and a 250-mL pressure equalizing addition funnel. The flask and funnel are flame-dried under vacuum. After cooling to room temperature under an argon purge, propargyl bromide (33.4 mL of an 80 wt. % solution in toluene, 0.3 mol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 2) and diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 2) are added and the flask is fitted with a thermometer. The mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with an ice-salt bath. The prepared Grignard reagent is transferred to the addition funnel using an 18-gauge cannula and added to the propargyl bromide over 3 h. After the addition, the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 2 h at 0 \u00b0C (Note 3). Then the mixture is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a cold saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (200 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is back-extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL x 2) (Note 2). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C water bath). Purification is performed by vacuum distillation (70-80 \u00b0C/23 mmHg, fractionating column: 2 cm diameter x 15 cm length) to afford 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene(1) (18.6 g, 57% by the checker; 24.9 g, 77% by the submitter, see discussion) as a colorless liquid (Note 4).",

The other two necks are fitted with rubber septa. After evacuating and backfilling with argon the flask is charged with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter), Rh2(OAc)4 (180 mg, 0.4 mmol, 0.008 equiv) (Note 5), 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene (1) (19.5 g, 150 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 6) and CH2Cl2 (40 mL) (Note 2) under argon. The mixture is heated to reflux using an oil bath (55 \u00b0C, external temperature) and after 5 min at reflux, a solution of ethyl \u03b1-diazoacetoacetate2 (7.8 g, 50 mmol, 1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) is added using a syringe pump (10 mL/h). Upon completion of the addition, an additional quantity of Rh2(OAc)4 (40 mg, 0.1 mmol, 0.002 equiv) (Note 7) is added and the resulting mixture is refluxed for 2 h; the progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 3). Upon completion, the reaction is cooled to room temperature and concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 35 \u00b0C water bath). The residue is purified by column chromatography (column \u2205 = 80 mm with 300 g of silica gel (230-400 mesh); ~150 mL fractions; n-hexane (1.5 L) (Note 2) is used to recover 4-phenyl-1,2-butadiene 1 (fractions 5-12, 7.64 g, 39%); then a mixture of 3:1 n-hexane:ethyl acetate (Note 2) (2 L) is used to elute 1-acetyl-2-phenethylidene- cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester 2 (fractions 20-25, 15.1 g ) (Note 8).",

The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and the top of the condenser left open to the air. After being heated with an oil bath (80 \u00b0C) for 19 h the reaction is judged complete as evidenced by TLC (Note 3).

After applying vacuum followed by flushing with argon, the stirred mixture is treated with Ti(OEt)4 (21.3 mL, 22.8 g, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2), added by syringe. At this point, the reaction shows an intense yellow color. The rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper, and the stirred (700 rpm) mixture is heated so as to maintain the temperature of the oil bath at 72 \u00b0C for 4 h (Note 3), during which period its color changes to orange. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL), and then transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a mixture of ethyl acetate :brine (25 mL:25 mL). The resulting pale yellow suspension is filtered through a short plug of Celite (Note 4), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 1000 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford crude imine 3 as a yellow oil (Note 5). The crude material is purified by flash column chromatography (24 x 4.5 cm column containing 160 g of silica gel) (Note 6). A mixture of hexanes:ethyl acetate is used as the eluent, with a gradient of polarity as follows: hexanes:ethyl acetate 100:0 (about 500 mL), 20:1 (about 300 mL), 15:1 (about 300 mL), 9:1 (about 600 mL), 3:2 (about 300 mL), and finally 1:1 until no more product elutes (about 300 mL) (Notes 7 and 8). Fractions containing pure product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the resultant product is then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford imine 3 (9.54-9.78 g, 85-88% yield) as a yellow solid (Notes 9 and 10).",

After applying vacuum and flushing with argon, the flask is charged with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (490 mg, 0.8 mmol, 0.025 equiv), 2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol (143 mg, 1.6 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and 4 \u00c5 MS (3 g) while maintaining a positive pressure of argon (Notes 11 and 12). The system is again evacuated and filled with argon [5 cycles vacuum (6 seconds), then argon], and a positive pressure of argon is maintained throughout the remainder of the experiment. Dry isopropyl alcohol (25 mL) is added using a syringe (Note 13) and the rubber septum is replaced by a glass stopper. The stirred (450 rpm) reaction mixture is then placed in a preheated oil bath (bath temperature 86 \u00b0C) for 25 min, resulting in a color change to cherry-red (Note 14). The oil-bath is replaced with a water-bath (preheated to 50 \u00b0C) and heating is adjusted to maintain the temperature at about 50 \u00b0C (Note 15). After replacing the glass stopper with a rubber septum, a previously prepared solution of imine 3 (7.147 g, 32.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (160 mL) under argon is added to the reaction mixture using a cannula (over about 10 min), and the stirring speed is increased to 600 rpm. The temperature of the system is allowed to stabilize at 50 \u00b0C over approximately 5 minutes, then a previously prepared solution of potassium tert-butoxide (449 mg, 4.0 mmol, 0.125 equiv) in dry isopropyl alcohol (40 mL) is added to the reaction mixture using a syringe (Note 16). The resulting brownish mixture is stirred at 50 \u00b0C (external temperature) for 2 h (Note 17). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath for 15 min, then filtered through a short plug of silica gel (Note 18), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 600 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). In order to ensure the removal of the ruthenium complex, solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and the residue is dissolved in 40 mL of ethyl acetate and passed through a short plug of silica gel (Note 19), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 500 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) and then subjected to high vacuum (5 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford pure sulfinamide 4 (7.20-7.22 g, >99% yield) as a brown oil (Notes 20 , 21 and 22).",

The flask is purged using a vacuum followed by nitrogen introduction (3 times) and maintained under a positive pressure of nitrogen. It is then charged with 4 (6.76 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and dry methanol (60 mL) (Note 23) using a syringe. The solution is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C using an ice-water bath. While stirring, a 2M solution of HCl in diethyl ether (75 mL, 150 mmol, 5.0 equiv) is added by syringe (Note 24). After 5 min, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred (600 rpm) at room temperature for 3 h. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (10-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature). The residue is dissolved in aqueous 2M HCl solution (100 mL) then extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL). While the combined organic layers are discarded, the acidic aqueous layer is cooled to 0-5 \u00b0C using an ice-water bath and treated with aqueous 6M NaOH solution (100 mL), which is added in portions over 5 min while stirring, resulting in a pH > 12. The resulting mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL) and the combined organic layers are washed with H2O (25 mL) and brine (25 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (4 g), filtered, then concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) (Note 25) to afford pure amine 5 (3.09-3.22 g, 85-88% yield, 95% ee of the (R)-enantiomer)as a pale yellow oil (Notes 26 and 27)."

Distilled H2O (20 mL), acetone (30 mL), and NaHCO3 (24 g, 0.285 mol) are combined in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and chilled in an ice/water bath with magnetic stirring (oblong stirbar, 3 cm x 1 cm x 1.5 cm) for 20 min (Note 1). After 20 min, stirring is halted and Oxone (25 g, 0.0406 mol) is added in a single portion (Note 2). The flask is loosely covered and the slurry is stirred vigorously for 15 min while still submerged in the ice bath. After 15 min, the stir bar is removed from the reaction flask and rinsed with a small portion of distilled water.\nThe flask containing the reaction slurry is then attached to a rotary evaporator with the bath at room temperature. The bump bulb (250 mL) (Note 3) is chilled in a dry ice/acetone bath and a vacuum of 155 mmHg is applied via a benchtop diaphragm pump and an accompanied in-line vacuum regulator. During this process, the flask is rotated vigorously (210 rpm) to prevent bumping of the slurry into the bump trap (Note 4). After 15 min, the bath temperature is raised to 40 \u00b0C over the course of 10 min. When the bath reaches 40 \u00b0C, the distillation is halted immediately via releasing the vacuum and raising the flask from the heated water bath.\nThe pale yellow acetone solution of DMDO is decanted from the bump bulb directly into a graduated cylinder to measure the total volume of the solution (an average of 25 mL) and then the solution is dried over Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 is removed by filtration and rinsed with 10 mL of acetone. Titration of the obtained DMDO solution is then performed according to the procedure of Adam, et al.2 (Note 5). Results consistently show 2.1-2.3 mmol total DMDO in the solution, giving a final concentration typically in the range of 60-65 mM (Note 6). The DMDO solution was used immediately following titration."

The mixture is stirred and heated gently on the steam bath until solution is effected, and the evolution of hydrogen chloride (Note 4) ceases after about 3 hours. The excess thionyl chloride is distilled by heating on a steam bath, the last portion of the reagent being taken off under reduced pressure.\nTo the acid chloride, mechanically stirred and heated on the steam bath, is added 2.5 kg. (805 ml., 15.6 moles) of dry bromine (p. 124) as rapidly as it will react (Note 5). The addition requires about 12 hours. The contents of the flask are stirred and heated an additional 2 hours, transferred to a dropping funnel (Note 6), and added in a thin stream to 5 l. of absolute ethanol, which has previously been placed in a 12-l. flask provided with a stopper carrying an efficient reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer. The resulting vigorous reaction is controlled by external cooling. After the dibromoacid chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and is then poured into 5 l. of cold water. The top ethanolic aqueous layer is decanted and extracted once with 8 l. of ether. The oily bottom layer is dissolved in the ether extract and washed first with 1 l. of a 2% sodium bisulfite solution, then with two 1-l. portions of 3% sodium carbonate solution, and finally with several portions of water. The ether solution is dried over 175 g. of potassium carbonate; the solvent is distilled on the steam bath. The yield of residual ester (Note 7) amounts to 2260\u20132400 g. (91\u201397%).",

The addition is so regulated as to permit rather vigorous refluxing and requires 45 minutes. Heating on the steam bath and stirring are continued an additional 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and is cooled. The potassium muconate and potassium bromide are filtered (Note 9), washed on the funnel with two 350-ml. portions of methanol and 400 ml. of ether, transferred without further drying to an enameled 11- to 12-l. pail, and dissolved in 8 l. of hot water. The aqueous solution, to which is added 30 g. of Norit, is heated to boiling by introduction of steam, filtered through a Norit filter pad by suction, and cooled in an ice-salt bath. The muconic acid is precipitated by the addition of a large excess (1.5 l.) (sp. gr. 1.18) of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the cold solution. The acid is added in a thin stream to the well-stirred solution. After 2 hours the muconic acid is filtered, washed first with two 400-ml. portions of cold water and then with 200 ml. of methanol, and dried at 85\u00b0.

        "Procedure": [
            "A diagrammatic sketch of the complete apparatus for the laboratory production and use of ozone in organic reactions is shown in Fig. 21.\nFig. 21.\nA. Purification train. Oxygen from a cylinder (A) fitted with a reducing valve (B) is led to a pressure release tube (C). This is a T-tube, the long arm of which dips into a test tube of mercury. The height of the mercury column should be about 2 to 3 cm. The release tube is connected through a stopcock (1) to a 40-cm. condenser jacket (D). This is filled with 4-mesh anhydrous calcium chloride held in place by plugs of glass wool at the ends. A second condenser jacket (E) is filled about halfway with 4-mesh soda lime, then a 4- to 6-in. layer of anhydrous calcium chloride, and the remainder of the tube is packed with glass wool. The ends of the condensers are closed with rubber stoppers. Part F is a flowmeter, the U-tube of which should be about 20 cm. long. The bore of the capillary should be about 0.5 mm. in diameter. The flowmeter tube is filled about half full with Hyvac pump oil. Part G is a condenser jacket (40 cm.) loosely packed with glass wool.\nAll parts up to the ozonizer may be connected with heavy rubber tubing or, preferably, Tygon tubing. If rubber tubing is used, it is desirable to place this purification train several feet from the ozonizer proper in order to prolong the life of the rubber connectors (Note 1). The sizes of parts C through G are not critical. After this part of the apparatus has been assembled, a very rapid stream of oxygen should be passed through it for 30 minutes in order to blow out all dust particles.",
            "B. Ozonizer. The conversion of oxygen to ozone is accomplished by means of three Berthelot tubes constructed of soft lime glass (Note 2) with the dimensions shown in Fig. 22. It is important that the glass be thoroughly cleaned and that the annular space through which the gases pass be as uniform as possible. Each tube has a cooling coil (Note 3) consisting of a long U-shaped piece of 6-mm. Pyrex glass tubing which fits into the innermost space of the Berthelot tube and reaches nearly to the bottom. The top of the Berthelot tube is closed by a cork with three holes, two for the cooling tubes and one for the inner electrode. The last is a stainless steel rod about 2\u20134 mm. in diameter. This electrode should extend to about 1 cm. of the bottom of the inner tube. The Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) are connected by means of mercury-cup seals as shown in Fig. 23 (Note 4). The third Berthelot tube is connected to the reaction vessels by means of either mercury-cup seals or ground-glass joints. No rubber connectors can be used for gases containing ozone.\nFig. 22.\nFig. 23.\nThe three Berthelot tubes are mounted vertically in a large battery jar about 13 in. by 9 in. by 18 in. (Note 5). They are held in place by a wooden top (see Fig. 23) which has holes and slots cut to fit the tubes. A second wooden block with holes and slots to fit the bottom of the Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) is placed in the bottom of the battery jar. It should be weighted with a few pieces of lead. Both the top and the bottom blocks should be soaked in hot molten paraffin wax. The holes in the top should be directly above those in the bottom so that the Berthelot tubes will be as nearly vertical as possible to facilitate making good connections (Note 6). However, a slight slant of the tubes does not affect the operation of the ozonizer.",
            "C. Electrical equipment. A transformer operating on 110 volts alternating current having a secondary capable of producing about 8000\u201315,000 volts and a capacity of about 400 watts or more is suitable. It is important that provision be made for varying the secondary voltage. This may be done by purchasing a transformer provided with taps on the primary windings or by inserting a variable transformer in series with the primary (Note 7). During the initial test runs for calibration it is desirable to connect an ammeter in the primary circuit in order to make certain the transformer is not overloaded.\nThe inner electrodes of the Berthelot tubes are connected to one of the secondary terminals of the transformer. This wire must be grounded (Note 8); otherwise the cooling tube inside the Berthelot tube will act as a conductor to the water line and the laboratory water line would be charged. The other wire from the secondary is connected to the electrode in the battery jar. This outer electrode consists of a grid of stainless-steel wire (No. 8 or 10 B. and S. gauge). Connecting the inner electrode to the ground results in a charge on the battery jar. Precautions must be taken so that the jar is not touched while the current is passing. Also the battery jar must be kept away from any of the plumbing so that it will not be grounded. It is best to arrange a wooden shield so that the operator cannot come in contact with any of the high-voltage connections of the secondary.",
            "D. Ozone absorption assembly. One useful combination of reaction flasks is shown in Fig. 24. It is best that the parts be connected by ground-glass joints. Tube H is the main reaction flask (Note 9), I is a condensing tube surrounded by acetone and Dry Ice to trap any volatile compounds, and J is an auxiliary analyzing tube for determining the amount of ozone not absorbed by the compound in tube H. The tubes should be assembled and clamped high enough above the desk for cooling baths to be placed around tubes H and I in order that ozonizations may be carried out at temperatures below that of the surroundings.\nFig. 24.",
            "E. Ozone destroyer. Ozone is a powerful irritant. The maximum possible working concentration has been reported to be 0.15 to 1.0 part per million of air.1 It is necessary to destroy any excess ozone and to see that the exit tube from the above absorption assembly is connected to a good hood. It is safer to incorporate an ozone destroyer in the set-up. One such destroyer consists of two tall towers (30 in.) filled with broken glass moistened with 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and connected in series (Note 10). The room in which an ozonizer is used should be well ventilated.",
            "F. Analysis for ozone. The analysis is made by passing a definite amount of oxygen through the ozonizer at a selected secondary voltage and then through a neutral 2% solution of potassium iodide. Iodine is liberated, and the resulting solution is acidified with 10% sulfuric acid (about 15 ml.) and titrated with a previously standardized 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution using soluble starch as the indicator.",
            "G. Procedure and calibration of apparatus. For satisfactory use of an ozonizer it is desirable to obtain data relating rate of flow and secondary voltage with the amount of ozone produced.\nA wet-type gas meter (Note 11) is connected to the tube J as indicated in Fig. 24. Enough 2% potassium iodide solution (about 70 ml.) is added to absorption tubes H and J to fill them to a depth of about one-third to one-half their height, and the tubes are marked at this level (Note 12). The reducing valve of the oxygen tank is opened far enough to show a pressure of 3\u20134 lb. per sq. in.; stopcocks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are turned so as to by-pass H, I, and J and direct the gases through the ozone destroyer. Stopcock 1 is opened far enough to give a flowmeter reading of about 2\u20133 mm.; the transformer is turned on and adjusted to a definite voltage (Note 13). After the apparatus has been swept out for 5 minutes, the stopcocks are turned so as to pass the ozonized oxygen successively through tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter. The ozonized oxygen is passed through the potassium iodide solution for 5 minutes (stopwatch), and notes are made of the exact flowmeter reading and the volume of gas passing through the wet meter. At the end of 5 minutes the stopcocks are turned so as to by-pass tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter; and the ozonized oxygen stream is directed through the ozone destroyer. (Caution: do not pass the ozone through the wet gas meter.) The solutions in H and J are then combined, acidified, and titrated as described in paragraph F above. Practically all the ozone is absorbed in tube H. The second tube J is to prevent any damage to the wet gas meter.\nThe procedure is then repeated, the secondary voltage being kept constant but the rate of flow of oxygen being increased so that the flowmeter readings are about 5 mm. and 10 mm. The voltage is then changed so that the general range of 7000\u201312,000 volts in steps of about 1000 volts is obtained (Note 13). Determinations of ozone produced are made for each voltage and each rate of flow. These data may be plotted on coordinate paper in order to determine the performance of the ozonizer. A portion of such data is summarized in Table I, which represents the results from two different ozonizers constructed by different workers in different laboratories.\nTABLE I VARIATION IN PERCENTAGE (BY VOLUME) OF OZONE (FROM OXYGEN) WITH RATE OF FLOW AND SECONDARY VOLTAGE\nFlowmeter Reading, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nOzonizer 1\n2.0\n5.6\n1.3%\n3.1%\n4.5%\n6.0%\n...\n...\n6.0\n10.6\n0.9\n2.1\n4.2\n5.6\n...\n...\n12.0\n15.4\n0.5\n1.7\n3.6\n4.9\n...\n...\nOzonizer 2\n2.0\n5.7\n6.7%\n7.0%\n7.1%\n7.3%\n7.2%\n7.1%\n5.0\n9.8\n6.0\n6.5\n6.7\n7.2\n6.9\n6.8\n10.0\n14.4\n5.5\n6.2\n6.5\n6.7\n6.8\n6.9\nFor practical use in ozonolysis of compounds it is convenient to recalculate these data to show the time required to produce 0.1 mole of ozone at a specified rate of flow and voltage. This is illustrated by Table II.\nTABLE II HOURS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 0.1 MOLE OZONE FROM OXYGEN\nFlowmeter, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\n2.0\n5.7\n5.97\n5.55\n5.55\n5.48\n5.48\n5.48\n5.0\n9.8\n3.60\n3.55\n3.42\n3.32\n3.33\n3.33\n10.0\n14.4\n2.90\n2.57\n2.43\n2.32\n2.29\n2.26\nAll ozonizers have individual characteristics since it is difficult if not impossible to build two absolutely identical ozonizers. Variations in the composition of the glass and the annular space in the Berthelot tubes cause considerable changes in the amount of ozone produced, as shown by Table I. Hence the performances indicated by the data in Table I would be duplicated only under very fortuitous circumstances. The production of ozone from the same ozonizer may vary from time to time; hence it is desirable to check the percentage of ozone occasionally. If the production of ozone drops markedly, the Berthelot tubes should be carefully cleaned with hot nitric acid, thoroughly rinsed, and dried. Higher percentages of ozone may be obtained by having more Berthelot tubes. With six tubes, concentrations of 9\u201311% may be obtained.",
            "H. Ozonization of organic compounds. The ozonization of each unsaturated organic compound is more or less an individual problem, but some general comments may be made. Organic ozonides are highly explosive, and hence it is safest to carry out the ozonization in a solvent which dissolves both the original compound and the ozonide. In all cases, a shatter proof screen of laminated safety glass should be placed between the operator and the tubes H, I, and J. A second screen should be placed back of the tubes to protect other pieces of the apparatus.\nThe general procedure consists in dissolving a weighed amount of the compound in a suitable solvent such as glacial acetic acid, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, or carbon tetrachloride. The solution is placed in tube H, and such an amount is used that the same hydrostatic head is obtained as when the 2% potassium iodide solution was used in both tubes H and J. Usually both tubes H and I are surrounded by cooling baths. The ozonizer is started and the gases by-passed through the destroyer for about 5 minutes while the apparatus is attaining equilibrium. The ozonized oxygen is then passed through the solution of the compound for the calculated time. Since all organic compounds do not absorb ozone rapidly enough for a quantitative absorption it is frequently necessary to run the ozonization longer. The presence of unsaturation may often be detected by testing a small portion of the reaction mixture with a dilute solution of bromine in carbon tetrachloride. The ozonization is continued until the test with the bromine solution is negative.\nIt is also possible to place a solution of the compound in tube H to the proper height and use a 2% potassium iodide solution in tube J. At the end of the calculated time the contents of tube J are titrated in order to determine the amount of ozone that failed to react with the compound. From these data the additional time necessary to complete the ozonization is calculated and the apparatus operated accordingly (Note 14) and (Note 15).\nThe procedures for the decomposition of the ozonide and separation of the reaction products will vary according to the nature of the compounds and must be designed and selected accordingly.\nSelective ozonization of compounds containing different types of unsaturated linkages is possible by choosing a proper concentration of ozone and by stopping the ozonization at the right time. It is for this reason that the calibration described above is carried out, since for certain ozonizations it is important to have the correct concentration for best results.\n1. Use of air in place of oxygen. When air is the source of oxygen the exit gases from the Berthelot tubes contain lower percentages of ozone than when pure oxygen is used. The gases also contain small amounts of nitric anhydride,2 the presence of which may cause some side reactions to occur. However, a considerable number of compounds may be satisfactorily ozonized with air as the source of oxygen. The above apparatus will operate satisfactorily with compressed air. It is essential to bubble the compressed air through three 5-l. flasks half filled with concentrated sulfuric acid before passing the air into the purification train B, C, D, E, F, G. Some data on the production of ozone from air at a secondary potential of 10,000 volts are given in Table III.\nTABLE III PRODUCTION OF OZONE FROM AIR AT SECONDARY VOLTAGE OF 10,000\nRate of Flow\n15.3 l./hr.\n21.8 l./hr.\nOzone, % by volume\n3.0\n2.9\nHours for production of 0.1 mole ozone\n4.8\n3.4\nN2O5, % by volume\n0.13\n0.08\nMoles HNO3 formed per 0.1 mole ozone\n0.009\n0.006\nAt higher secondary voltages the percentage of nitrogen pentoxide rises. A decrease in the rate of flow also increases the amount of nitrogen pentoxide. It is obvious from the data in Table III that the amounts of nitrogen pentoxide are very small and need to be considered only when examining a reaction mixture for small amounts of by-products or when the presence of this oxide of nitrogen would act as a catalyst for the oxidation of the organic compounds by oxygen or ozone."

(107 ml., 1.12 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.\nWater is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3), whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175\u00b0 over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30\u201360 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter. The flask is cooled and broken to remove the product.\nThe brown solid from the above operations is ground in a mortar and placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask equipped with a downward condenser and a receiver. A cold solution of 100 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added to the solid in the flask, and heat is applied by means of an oil bath whose temperature is slowly raised to 125\u00b0 From 70 to 75 g. of distillate is collected; the head temperature ranges from about 70\u00b0 to 101\u00b0 (Note 2). The distillate is cooled in ice and saturated with technical potassium hydroxide; the organic layer that forms is separated and dried over potassium hydroxide pellets in a refrigerator for about 15 hours.\nThe organic layer is separated from the drying agent and distilled from a few fresh pellets of potassium hydroxide through a column of the Whitmore-Fenske type. After a 3- to 5-g. fore-run, the product distils at 71\u201372\u00b0; the yield is 36\u201341 g. (45\u201351%) (Note 4) and (Note 5).",

The contents of the bomb are removed and filtered to separate the catalyst, which is washed on the funnel with a little dioxane.\nThe filtrates from two such runs are combined and distilled through a Whitmore-Fenske column of 10\u201315 theoretical plates at a 5:1 reflux ratio. The yield of tert-butylamine is 55\u201360 g. (75\u201382%); the product boils at 44\u201344.5\u00b0, and its refractive index is nD20 1.3770 (Note 8).",

(105 ml., 1.98 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and 60 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered urea is added slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. Then 148 g. (188 ml., 2 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise from the funnel at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 (Note 2). After the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours) (Note 3), and then poured with stirring on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. Without removal of the precipitate, the mixture is made alkaline to Congo red indicator by adding slowly with stirring a solution of sodium hydroxide (160 g. in 750 ml. of water). The mixture is cooled with an ice bath to keep the temperature below 25\u00b0. The mixture is stirred in the ice bath until the temperature falls to about 15\u00b0 (Note 4), at which point the precipitate is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The cake is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling and quickly filtered while hot through an 8-cm. steam-heated B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 5) with the aid of suction. The filtrate is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 with occasional stirring, and the white precipitate of tert-butylurea is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and pressed as dry as possible. After the product has been spread out on absorbent paper and air-dried overnight (Note 6) there is obtained 36\u201339 g.

            "B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200\u00b0. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240\u00b0 (internal temperature 200\u00b0) and held there for 5 minutes (Note 8). The flask is removed and cooled to 60\u201370\u00b0, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0 and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40\u201343 g. and melts at 58\u201359\u00b0. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2\u20134 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43\u201346.5 g. (72\u201376%).",

(1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate. The solution is refluxed for 2 hours and cooled, and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml.) is added until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red paper, though a large excess of acid is avoided. The voluminous precipitate of phthalhydrazide is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and washed with four 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 200 ml. About 1 l. of water is added, any insoluble material is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 300\u2013350 ml. If any additional insoluble material separates it is removed by filtration, and the solvent is completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. This crude amine hydrochloride may be converted to the free amine as described below, or it may be purified by solution in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution being filtered and 500 ml. of dry ether being added to the filtrate. The crude amine hydrochloride is collected on a filter; the solvent is removed by suction, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute ethanol using 5 ml. per gram of material; absolute ether (50% of the volume of ethanol) is added, and the solution is cooled in a refrigerator for several hours. All the tert-butylamine hydrochloride is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator. It weighs 79\u201397 g.

The flasks are placed in an ice-salt bath and chilled to 0\u00b0; to each flask there is then added 45 ml. (35.2 g., 0.78 mole) of acetaldehyde. When the contents of the flasks have cooled to \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 there is added to each flask, with shaking, a solution of 2 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol. The flasks, the contents of which become cloudy in a short time because of the separation of water, are kept in the ice-salt bath for 6 hours. The reaction mixtures are then combined in a 1-l. flask and placed in an icebox. About 24 hours later, 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with shaking, and the flask is replaced in an icebox until the next day. The addition of 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is repeated once more, and the mixture is again returned to the icebox for 24 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature. At some point during this reaction period the mixture should crystallize as a mass of yellow-white needles (Note 3). This product is crude ethyl ethylidenebisacetoacetate.\nThe crude bis ester is melted on a steam cone and poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask containing 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and approximately 10 g. of small chips of porous plate (Note 4). The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. There is a copious evolution of carbon dioxide which should be directed to a gas-absorption trap since it is accompanied by acetic acid vapors. The mixture is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2 l. of ice water in a 4-l. beaker. Enough ether is added to allow separation of the layers (Note 5), and the organic layer is returned to the beaker with 1.2\u20131.3 l. of water. With the aid of good stirring the mixture is neutralized by slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until the effervescence ceases. The layers are separated, and the material so obtained may be used immediately for the preparation of 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. To obtain 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, the ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with 100 ml. of water containing 2 ml. of acetic acid, is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. After a very slight fore-run the main fraction is collected at 135\u2013155\u00b0/10 mm. This is redistilled through a moderately good column, preferably of the Widmer or Vigreux type. The product is 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, b.p. 136\u2013138\u00b0/9 mm. The yield is 220\u2013234 g. (47\u201350%).",

The ether is removed on a steam cone, perferably with the aid of an aspirator, and there are added 1140 ml. of water, 60 ml. of ethanol (95%), and 130 g. of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is shaken continuously and heated on a steam cone until the alkali dissolves, and heating is continued on a steam cone with frequent shaking until the ester dissolves (Note 6). The solution is then refluxed for 15 minutes.\nThe flask is cooled with a stream of water while a solution of 100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water is added slowly and cautiously (Note 7). The acidified mixture is heated under reflux for 15 minutes, allowed to cool, and the layers are separated. The crude product is diluted with 100 ml. of ether and washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and with 100 ml. of water containing 5 ml. of acetic acid. The ethereal solution, after drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, is distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. The product boiling at 84\u201386\u00b0/9 mm. is 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one; the yield is 155\u2013165 g. (52\u201355%) (Note 8)."

The gas inlet tube is connected to a source of boron fluorides (Note 3), and an ice bath is applied to the reaction flask; when the temperature of the stirred mixture has fallen to approximately 0\u00b0 the stream of boron fluoride is started and adjusted so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 7\u00b0. The addition of boron fluoride is continued until the mixture is saturated and for 15 minutes thereafter (Note 4).

After 10 minutes' standing, 230 ml. of dilute sulfuric acid (57 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, sp. gr. 1.84, in 173 ml. of water) is added with stirring, the same low temperature being maintained. A copious precipitate of potassium sulfate is formed. The pH of the solution is then about 1.9. A 5% potassium hydroxide solution is then added, dropwise, and with cooling, until the pH is about 3.0 (determined either by means of a pH meter or tropaeolin 00 paper); about 4 ml. of the solution is required. The flask is then removed from the cooling bath, 30 ml. of ether is added, and the mixture is well shaken. The salt is removed by filtration, using a 14-cm.

The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the cold finger is filled with solid carbon dioxide in acetone. Approximately 1.7 l. of dry ether and 61 g. (2.5 gram atoms) of magnesium are placed in the flask and cooled to about 0\u00b0. Methyl chloride (130 ml., 130 g., 2.6 moles) is condensed (Note 3) in a 250- to 300-ml. test tube held in a bath of solid carbon dioxide in acetone (Note 4). About 50 ml. of methyl chloride is allowed to distil from the test tube containing the methyl chloride through the gas delivery tube into the rapidly stirred mixture of ether and magnesium. The reaction mixture is then warmed until the reaction of methyl chloride and magnesium is under way. A crystal of iodine may be added if the reaction does not start readily. The methyl chloride is then allowed to distil into the reaction mixture during a period of about 3 hours. The reaction mixture and the tube containing the methyl chloride are cooled if the refluxing of the reaction mixture becomes so vigorous that the reflux condenser does not condense the methyl chloride. After all the methyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is warmed for 1 hour so that there is a gentle reflux.\nAt the end of this time, when almost all the magnesium has reacted, the Dry Ice cold finger is replaced with a water condenser and the gas delivery tube with a dropping funnel. A solution of 142 g. (2.02 moles) of freshly distilled crotonaldehyde in 300 ml. of dry ether is added dropwise while the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and cooled. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\nThe Grignard addition compound is decomposed by adding 435 ml. of a saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 5) dropwise, with vigorous stirring, to the thoroughly cooled reaction mixture. A dense white precipitate, too heavy to be stirred mechanically, forms and settles to the bottom of the flask. After the reaction mixture has been allowed to stand for 1 hour, the ether solution is poured off and the precipitate washed by decantation with two 300-ml. portions of ether.\nThe ether is removed by distillation, and the residual 3-penten-2-ol is distilled through a short column (Note 6) at atmospheric pressure.

The combined filtrates and washings are cooled and then immediately added slowly (Note 6), with good stirring, to 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 7). The solution at this point is strongly acid to Congo red paper (Note 8). The acidified solution is cooled and thoroughly extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether (Note 9). The ether extracts are combined and washed once with 100 ml. of 10% sodium chloride solution, the ether is evaporated, and the residue is fractionally distilled in a modified Claisen flask. The yield of \u03b3-n-propylbutyrolactone boiling at 84\u201385\u00b0/5 mm., nD25 1.4385, is 13.0\u201314.9 g.

            "Caution! Carbon disulfide, used as a solvent in this preparation, is highly inflammable; its vapor may ignite on contact with a hot laboratory steam line.\nIn a 5-l. three-necked flask mounted on a steam bath in the hood and equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1) and a wide-bore condenser (Note 1) is placed 1.4 kg. (1.1 l.) of carbon disulfide. Through the open neck of the flask 202 g. (1.5 moles) of acetanilide and 300 g. (2.66 moles) of chloroacetyl chloride (Note 2) are introduced. The mixture is vigorously stirred while 600 g. (4.5 moles) of aluminum chloride is added in 25\u201350 g. portions over a period of 20\u201330 minutes; the neck of the flask is stoppered between additions (Note 3). After the addition of the last portion of aluminum chloride, the mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 30 minutes while stirring is continued. Heating and stirring are discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand for 3 hours, during which time it separates into layers. The upper layer (carbon disulfide) is decanted, and the viscous red-brown lower layer is poured cautiously with stirring into about 1 kg. of finely crushed ice to which 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. After the hydrolysis of the aluminum chloride, the product crystallizes as a white solid, which is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed well with water. It is then transferred to a beaker where it is thoroughly washed by stirring with sufficient 95% ethanol to give a fluid slurry. The solid is again collected on the funnel. After drying in the air it melts at 213\u2013214\u00b0 and weighs 250\u2013265 g. (79\u201383%). It can be recrystallized from 95% ethanol (about 1 l. of the solvent being required for 40 g. of the solid) as fine white crystals melting at 216\u00b0; the recovery in the recrystallization, without reworking of the mother liquor, is about 70%."

            "Ten grams (0.14 mole) of powdered sodium nitrite is dissolved in 50 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) contained in a 1-l. beaker placed in an ice bath. A solution of 10 g. of 4-nitro-1-naphthylamine (0.053 mole) (p. 664) in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is prepared by heating, and the well-stirred solution is cooled below 20\u00b0. Some crystals separate. The resulting thin slurry is dropped slowly into the cold solution of nitrosylsulfuric acid with mechanical stirring. Throughout the addition, and for 30 minutes thereafter, the temperature is kept below 20\u00b0. Seven hundred milliliters of dry ether is added slowly with stirring, and the temperature of the mixture is kept at 0\u00b0 for 1 hour. At the end of this period, the precipitation (aided by scratching) of the crystalline 4-nitronaphthalene-1-diazonium sulfate is complete (Note 1). This precipitate is collected, washed with ether and then with 95% ethanol until all the acid is removed, and finally dissolved in 100 ml. of iced water.\nA saturated aqueous solution containing 50 g. of crystalline copper sulfate is treated with a similar solution of 50 g. of crystallized sodium sulfite. The greenish brown precipitate is collected, washed with water (Note 2), and then stirred into a solution of 100 g. (1.45 moles) of sodium nitrite in 400 ml. of water contained in a 2-l. beaker provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer.\nThe cold aqueous solution of the diazonium salt is then added slowly to the decomposition mixture. Considerable frothing occurs, and 4\u20135 ml. of ether is added from time to time to break the foam. After stirring for 1 hour (Note 3), the mixture is filtered and the crude dark brown precipitate of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene is washed several times with water, then with 2% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and again with water. The precipitate is dried and extracted three times with boiling 95% ethanol (450 ml. in all). The extract is concentrated to 75 ml.; most of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene separates and is collected. Additional amounts can be obtained by further concentration. The resulting product melts at 130\u2013132\u00b0 and weighs 6.0\u20137.0 g. (52\u201360%). The product can be purified either by steam distillation (Note 4) or by recrystallization from aqueous ethanol. Pale yellow needles melting at 134\u00b0 are obtained (Note 5) and (Note 6)."

            "A. 2,2-Dimethylethylenimine. A cold mixture of 110 g. (60 ml., 1.06 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid and 200 ml. of water is added in portions, with shaking, to a solution of 100 g. (107 ml., 1.12 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.\nWater is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3), whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175\u00b0 over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30\u201360 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter. The flask is cooled and broken to remove the product.\nThe brown solid from the above operations is ground in a mortar and placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask equipped with a downward condenser and a receiver. A cold solution of 100 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added to the solid in the flask, and heat is applied by means of an oil bath whose temperature is slowly raised to 125\u00b0 From 70 to 75 g. of distillate is collected; the head temperature ranges from about 70\u00b0 to 101\u00b0 (Note 2). The distillate is cooled in ice and saturated with technical potassium hydroxide; the organic layer that forms is separated and dried over potassium hydroxide pellets in a refrigerator for about 15 hours.\nThe organic layer is separated from the drying agent and distilled from a few fresh pellets of potassium hydroxide through a column of the Whitmore-Fenske type. After a 3- to 5-g. fore-run, the product distils at 71\u201372\u00b0; the yield is 36\u201341 g. (45\u201351%) (Note 4) and (Note 5).",

(alcohol-wet weight) of Raney nickel.2 The apparatus is filled with hydrogen, warmed to 60\u00b0, and shaken until hydrogenation is complete (Note 7). The contents of the bomb are removed and filtered to separate the catalyst, which is washed on the funnel with a little dioxane.\nThe filtrates from two such runs are combined and distilled through a Whitmore-Fenske column of 10\u201315 theoretical plates at a 5:1 reflux ratio. The yield of tert-butylamine is 55\u201360 g. (75\u201382%); the product boils at 44\u201344.5\u00b0, and its refractive index is nD20 1.3770 (Note 8).",

(105 ml., 1.98 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and 60 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered urea is added slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. Then 148 g. (188 ml., 2 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise from the funnel at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 (Note 2). After the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours) (Note 3), and then poured with stirring on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. Without removal of the precipitate, the mixture is made alkaline to Congo red indicator by adding slowly with stirring a solution of sodium hydroxide (160 g. in 750 ml. of water). The mixture is cooled with an ice bath to keep the temperature below 25\u00b0. The mixture is stirred in the ice bath until the temperature falls to about 15\u00b0 (Note 4), at which point the precipitate is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The cake is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling and quickly filtered while hot through an 8-cm. steam-heated B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 5) with the aid of suction. The filtrate is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 with occasional stirring, and the white precipitate of tert-butylurea is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and pressed as dry as possible. After the product has been spread out on absorbent paper and air-dried overnight (Note 6) there is obtained 36\u201339 g.

            "B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200\u00b0. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240\u00b0 (internal temperature 200\u00b0) and held there for 5 minutes (Note 8). The flask is removed and cooled to 60\u201370\u00b0, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0 and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40\u201343 g. and melts at 58\u201359\u00b0. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2\u20134 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43\u201346.5 g. (72\u201376%).",

(1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate. The solution is refluxed for 2 hours and cooled, and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml.) is added until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red paper, though a large excess of acid is avoided. The voluminous precipitate of phthalhydrazide is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and washed with four 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 200 ml. About 1 l. of water is added, any insoluble material is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 300\u2013350 ml. If any additional insoluble material separates it is removed by filtration, and the solvent is completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. This crude amine hydrochloride may be converted to the free amine as described below, or it may be purified by solution in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution being filtered and 500 ml. of dry ether being added to the filtrate. The crude amine hydrochloride is collected on a filter; the solvent is removed by suction, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute ethanol using 5 ml. per gram of material; absolute ether (50% of the volume of ethanol) is added, and the solution is cooled in a refrigerator for several hours. All the tert-butylamine hydrochloride is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator. It weighs 79\u201397 g.

(0.22 g. atom) of magnesium turnings. Five milliliters (0.085 mole) of absolute ethanol and 0.5 ml. of carbon tetrachloride are added. If the reaction does not start immediately, the flask is heated for a short time on a steam bath. After the reaction has proceeded for several minutes, 150 ml. of absolute ether is added cautiously with stirring. A solution of 35.2 g. (0.22 mole) of diethyl malonate (Note 1), 20 ml. (0.34 mole) of absolute ethanol, and 25 ml. of absolute ether is added with stirring at such a rate that rapid boiling is maintained; heat is supplied when necessary.

(0.2 mole) of o-nitrobenzoyl chloride (Note 2), dissolved in 50 ml. of ether, in a period of 15 minutes. Heating under reflux on the steam bath is continued throughout the addition of the o-nitrobenzoyl chloride and until the green solution becomes too viscous to stir. The reaction mixture is cooled and shaken with dilute sulfuric acid (25 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water) until all the solid has dissolved (Note 3).\nThe ether phase is separated and the aqueous layer extracted with 75 ml. of ether. The ether extracts are combined and washed with water, and the solvent is removed by distillation.\nTo the crude diethyl o-nitrobenzoylmalonate is added a solution of 60 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 7.6 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 40 ml. of water, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours (Note 4) or until no more carbon dioxide is evolved. The reaction mixture is chilled in an ice bath, made alkaline with 20% sodium hydroxide solution, and extracted with several portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with water and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate followed by Drierite, and the solvent is removed by distillation.

The side necks are equipped with rubber stoppers each carrying a short length of 8-mm. glass tubing, bent at right angles. A 10\u201312 in. length of stout, flexible iron wire is passed through one of these pieces of tubing. Two liters of liquid ammonia (Note 2) and 2 g. of ferric nitrate hydrate are placed in the flask. One hundred grams of sodium (4.35 g. atoms) is cut into rectangular pieces about 3 by \u00be by \u00be in. in size. One of the pieces of sodium is hooked onto the lower end of the iron wire and lowered into the liquid ammonia. Stirring is not necessary during this part of the reaction, but it is advisable. When the lump of sodium has reacted, the solution turns from blue to gray, and the remaining pieces of sodium are added in the same manner. The addition requires about 45 minutes (Note 3).\nThe stopper carrying the iron wire is removed, 2 g. of anil is added, and then 528 g. (2 moles) of finely powdered, dry styrene dibromide is added gradually with vigorous stirring. The addition requires about 1 hour (Note 4). Stirring is continued for 2 hours (Note 5) after the addition has been completed, after which 600 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added, followed by 1 l. of distilled water, and the mixture is allowed to stand until the frost on the outside of the flask is entirely melted.\nThe aqueous solution is then steam-distilled from the same flask (Note 6) until no more oil passes over. This usually requires about 6 hours, and 1.5\u20132 l. of distillate is collected. The phenylacetylene in the distillate is separated and washed several times with distilled water to remove ammonia (Note 7). The washed material is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilled through an efficient column (Note 8) under reduced pressure. Almost the entire product distils at 73\u201374\u00b0/80 mm.

The mixture is cooled to a temperature below 10\u00b0 by means of an ice-water bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 66.1 g. (0.50 mole) of cinnamaldehyde (Note 1) in 60 ml. of absolute ether is added, the rate of addition being controlled so that the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0. Throughout the addition, which takes about 1 hour, a slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask (Note 2).\nThe flask is detached from the condenser and stirrer, and its contents are transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel. The apparatus is then reassembled, without the nitrogen inlet tube or the drying tube, and 175 ml. of 30% sulfuric acid (by weight) is placed in the flask. Without cooling, but with efficient stirring with a Hershberg Nichrome wire stirrer at 1500\u20131700 r.p.m. (Note 3),2 the ethereal solution of the cinnamaldehyde-methylmagnesium bromide adduct is added rapidly to the acid. The time for this addition (5\u20137 minutes) is limited by the efficiency of the condenser. Heat then is applied to maintain gentle reflux until the total time elapsed from the initiation of hydrolysis is 20 minutes. The contents of the flask are immediately transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, the lower aqueous layer is discarded, and the ether layer is washed successively with 50 ml. of water, a mixture of 50 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and 50 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution, and 50 ml. of water. Before each of the washings the air in the separatory funnel is displaced with nitrogen. When the second wash solution is added, 0.3 g. of phenyl-\u03b2-naphthylamine is dissolved in the ether layer. The washed solution is dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 30 minutes and then with 15 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for 12 hours.\nThe ethereal solution is filtered and concentrated by distillation from a steam bath to a residual volume of 80\u2013100 ml. Some water separates at this time, and the mixture is cooled and then dried with about 15 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The concentrated solution is filtered into a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask3 and distilled under reduced pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere into a receiver containing 0.3 g. of phenyl-\u03b2-naphthylamine. In this manner 52\u201354 g. (80\u201383%) of crude trans-1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene is obtained, b.p. 81\u201385\u00b0/10\u201311 mm.; n25D 1.606\u20131.608, which may contain some methylstyrylcarbinol and water. This material is dried with 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and distilled as before. The yield of trans-1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene is 47\u201349 g. (72\u201375%), b.p. 78\u201381\u00b0/8 mm.; n25D 1.607\u20131.608. This product is satisfactory for most purposes (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

(0.81 mole) of diethyl benzalmalonate2 in 2 l. of absolute ethanol. The stirrer is started, and a solution of 56 g. (0.86 mole) of potassium cyanide in 100 ml. of water is added rapidly from the separatory funnel; a small amount of the potassium cyanide precipitates. The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 70\u00b0 and maintained at 65\u201375\u00b0 for 18 hours.\nThe mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0, and the precipitated potassium bicarbonate is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid (weight 70\u201372 g.) is washed on the funnel with 100 ml. of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and wash liquor is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask and made slightly acid (Caution! (Note 1)) with dilute hydrochloric acid (about 15\u201320 ml. of the 10% acid is required). The solution is then concentrated under reduced pressure to a semi-solid residue (Note 1). The cooled residue is shaken with a mixture of 300 ml. of water and 500 ml. of ether. The material dissolves completely; the water layer is separated and washed with 200 ml. of ether. The ether solutions are combined, dried over 20 g. of calcium chloride, filtered into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a glass joint, and concentrated by distillation (heating on a steam bath). The crude ethyl \u03b2-phenyl-\u03b2-cyanopropionate remains as a clear red oil weighing 130\u2013140 g. It is sufficiently pure for use in the next step (Note 2).",

            "B. 2,3-Pyrazinedicarboxylic acid. A 12-l. three-necked flask is provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 1-l. dropping funnel. In the flask are placed 4 l. of hot (about 90\u00b0) water and 145 g. (1.12 moles) of quinoxaline. With rapid stirring a saturated aqueous solution of 1050 g. (6.6 moles) of potassium permanganate (Note 4) is added through the dropping funnel in a thin stream. The rate of addition of the permanganate solution is adjusted so that the reaction mixture boils gently. The addition requires about 1.5 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled somewhat (Note 5) and filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The manganese dioxide cake is removed from the funnel and stirred to a smooth paste with 1 l. of fresh water. The slurry is filtered, and the washing is repeated. The total filtrate, about 10 l., is evaporated under reduced pressure on the steam bath to a volume of approximately 3 l. (Note 6). The solution is swirled or stirred gently while 550 ml. (6.6 moles) of 36% hydrochloric acid is cautiously added (Note 7). Evaporation under reduced pressure is then continued until a moist cake of solid potassium chloride and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid remains in the flask (Note 8).\nThe moist cake is scraped from the flask and allowed to dry in a 16-in. porcelain evaporating dish until the odor of hydrochloric acid is faint (about 24 hours, but this time can be reduced to about 8 hours if a gentle stream of air is directed onto the solid). The solid material is returned to the dried flask and mixed thoroughly with about 200 ml. of water. Two liters of acetone is added, and the mixture is boiled under reflux for 15 minutes, then cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 6-in. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid on the filter is returned to the flask, treated with 100 ml. of water, and extracted with 1 l. of boiling acetone as before (Note 9). The acetone filtrates are combined and distilled from a steam bath, finally under diminished pressure.\nThe solid in the flask is dissolved by refluxing with 2.5 l. of acetone. The mixture is cooled slightly, treated with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, refluxed for an additional 5-minute period, and filtered hot. Evaporation of the pale yellow acetone filtrate leaves the acid as a light-tan crystalline solid. If the product still possesses an odor of hydrochloric acid it is dried in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide pellets for a few hours. Finally the product is dried in an oven at 100\u00b0 for several hours (Note 10) and (Note 11). The yield of material melting at 165\u2013167\u00b0 (dec.) is 140\u2013145 g. (75\u201377%) (Note 12).\nIf a purer product is desired the material may be recrystallized (with about 17% loss) from 150 ml. of water; the hot solution is decolorized with carbon. The melting point after drying at 110\u00b0 for several hours is then 183\u2013185\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 11) and (Note 13)."

            "A solution of 170 g. (1.0 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of water in a 2-l. beaker is treated, with stirring, with a solution of 44 g. (1.07 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water (Note 1). The mixture is stirred for 5 minutes, and the silver oxide is collected on an 11-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and washed free of nitrates with water (Note 2). The wet, freshly precipitated silver oxide is transferred to a 4-l. beaker (Note 1), covered with 2 l. of water, and treated with 200 g. (4.85 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets with vigorous stirring. If the temperature of the mixture at this point is below 55\u00b0, the mixture is warmed to 55\u201360\u00b0. With continued stirring at 55\u201360\u00b0 (Note 3), 152 g. (1.0 mole) of vanillin (Note 4) is added; the reaction begins after a few minutes. The silver oxide is transformed to fluffy metallic silver, and considerable heat is evolved. Stirring is continued for 10 minutes, the mixture is filtered, and the precipitated silver is washed with 100 ml. of hot water. A rapid stream of sulfur dioxide gas (Note 5) is passed into the combined filtrate and washings for 2 minutes, and the resulting solution is poured into 1.1 l. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid with vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture, which should be acid to Congo red, is cooled to 15\u201320\u00b0. The vanillic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed to remove the mother liquor, washed with 150 ml. of ice water (Note 6), sucked as dry as possible, and air-dried. The yield is 140\u2013160 g. (83\u201395%) of white needles melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0. This product is pure enough for most purposes, but it may be purified by recrystallization from water containing a little sulfur dioxide, 1.2 l. of water being used per 100 g. of product. Pure white needles melting at 210\u2013211\u00b0 are obtained with a recovery of 90\u201397%.",
            "In a stainless-steel beaker of approximately 2-l. capacity (120 mm. by 165 mm.) equipped with an efficient mechanical Nichrome or Monel stirrer (Note 1) and heated by an electric hot plate are placed 178 g. (4.3 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets, 178 g. (2.7 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets (Note 2), and 50 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and heated to 160\u00b0, at which temperature the hot plate is turned off. Twenty-five grams of vanillin is added. The temperature drops somewhat, and after a very short time a vigorous reaction begins which raises the temperature to 180\u2013195\u00b0. An additional 127 g. (total of 1.0 mole) of vanillin is gradually added to the reaction mixture during a period of 10\u201312 minutes at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature (Note 3). After all the vanillin has been added, stirring is continued for 5 minutes. The hot plate is removed, and the mixture is allowed to cool with stirring. When the mixture cools to about 150\u2013160\u00b0, 1 l. of water is added and the mixture is stirred until all the fusion mixture is dissolved. The solution is transferred to a 4-l. beaker, 500 ml. of water being used to rinse the stirrer and metal beaker. Sulfur dioxide gas is introduced for 1 minute (Note 4), and the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. The mixture is acidified with about 1.2 l. of 6N hydrochloric acid using Congo red as the indicator and keeping the mixture cool during addition of the acid by stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The mixture is cooled, and the light-tan precipitate is filtered, washed with 150 ml. of ice water, and dried. The yield of vanillic acid melting at 206\u2013208\u00b0 is 150\u2013160 g. (89\u201395%) (Note 5). The product can be recrystallized from water, using 1.2 l. per 100 g. of vanillic acid. A 90\u201397% recovery of nearly white vanillic acid melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0 is obtained."

            "In a 500-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask provided with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a gas inlet tube through which a stream of nitrogen is passed (Note 1) are placed 206 g. (2.4 moles) of freshly distilled vinyl acetate (Note 2) and 80 g. (0.4 mole) of lauric acid (Note 3). The lauric acid is dissolved by warming, and 1.6 g. of mercuric acetate is added. The mixture is shaken by hand for about 30 minutes, and 0.15 ml. of 100% sulfuric acid is added dropwise (Note 4). The solution is heated under reflux for 3 hours, then 0.83 g. of sodium acetate trihydrate is added to neutralize the sulfuric acid. The excess vinyl acetate is recovered by distillation at atmospheric pressure (vapor temperature about 70\u201380\u00b0) until the pot temperature reaches 125\u00b0 (Note 5). The distillation is completed at 10 mm. or lower (Note 5), and, after the collection of a small quantity of low-boiling material, fairly pure vinyl laurate (Note 6) is obtained as a colorless liquid, b.p. 142\u2013143\u00b0/10 mm. (138\u2013139\u00b0/8 mm.; 124\u2013126\u00b0/3 mm.). The yield is 50\u201357 g. (55\u201363%). Redistillation (Note 7) yields 48\u201353 g. (53\u201359%) of pure vinyl laurate, b.p. 142\u2013142.5\u00b0/10 mm. (120\u2013120.5\u00b0/2 mm.); n25D 1.4387 (Note 8) and (Note 9)."
