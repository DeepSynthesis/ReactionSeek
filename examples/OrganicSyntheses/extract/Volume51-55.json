        "Procedure": [
            "A tared, 500-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and an ice-filled cooling bath. A solution of 13.5 g. (0.100 mole) of 4-aminoacetophenone (Note 1) in 200 ml. of acetone is placed in the flask and stirred while 32 ml. (about 0.3 mole) of aqueous 48% hydrobromic acid is added. After the resulting solution has been cooled to 5\u20137\u00b0, it is stirred continuously while 20 ml. of an aqueous solution containing 6.90 g. (0.100 mole) of sodium nitrite is added rapidly (30 seconds) beneath the surface of the reaction solution with a hypodermic syringe or a long-stemmed dropping funnel. Stirring and cooling are continued until the exothermic reaction subsides (Note 2) and the reaction solution has cooled to 14\u201315\u00b0. After 106 g. (100 ml., 1.47 moles) of acrylic acid (Note 3) is added, the solution is again cooled to 14\u201315\u00b0, with stirring, before 0.10\u20130.11 g. (0.00069\u20130.00077 mole) of copper(I) bromide (Note 4) is added. Stirring is continued, during which time the solution darkens, and nitrogen evolution is observed; the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 33\u00b0 by use of the external cooling bath. As soon as the evolution of nitrogen has ceased (usually 20 minutes is sufficient), the reaction solution is concentrated with a rotary evaporator, giving a mixture weighing about 120\u2013130 g. The residual brown suspension is mixed with 5 g. of decolorizing charcoal and 200 ml. of water, and the resulting mixture is boiled for 3 minutes, and filtered while hot through a B\u00fcchner funnel containing Celite filter aid. The residue on the filter is washed with 100 ml. of boiling water, and the combined filtrates are diluted with 300 ml. of water. The resulting aqueous solution, from which the product begins to crystallize, is cooled in a water bath and then allowed to stand in a refrigerator (0\u20133\u00b0) for 24 hours to complete the crystallization of the crude product. The crystalline solid is collected on a filter, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and dried in the air. The crude product, a pale yellow solid (19.1\u201322.2 g.), is recrystallized from 40 ml. of a 2:3 (v/v) formic acid-water mixture. The resulting crystals are collected on a filter, washed with 20 ml. of 2:3 (v/v) cold formic acid-water, and dried in the air, yielding 16.6\u201318.2 g. (61\u201367%) of white needles, m.p. 158\u2013160\u00b0, which are sufficiently pure for most purposes. Three additional crystallizations from 20-ml. portions of 2:3 (v/v) formic acid-water give 15.2\u201316.0 g. (56\u201359%) (Note 5) of the pure p-acetyl-\u03b1-bromohydrocinnamic acid, m.p. 159\u2013161\u00b0 (Note 6)."

Procedure A is the simplest to perform, but B is preferred for sensitive alcohols and in cases where elimination to olefins is expected, for example, with all tertiary and many secondary alcohols. Procedure A is best for sterically hindered alcohols, for example, neopentyl alcohol.\nCaution! Methyl iodide, in high concentrations for short periods or in low concentrations for long periods, can cause serious toxic effects in the central nervous system. Accordingly, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists2 has set five p.p.m., a level which cannot be detected by smell, as the highest average concentration in air to which workers should be exposed for long periods. The preparation and use of methyl iodide should always be performed in a well-ventilated fume hood. Since the liquid can be absorbed through the skin, care should be taken to prevent contact.\nA.

The time required is about 24 hours. It is necessary to adjust the heat input from the mantle from time to time as the reaction proceeds and the reflux rate diminishes (Note 2).\nThe reaction mixture is distilled under reduced pressure through a 13-cm.

A line for dry nitrogen that has a T-tube joined to a U-tube containing mercury is connected to the top of the addition funnel (Note 2). To the flask are added 150 ml. of purified dioxane (Note 3) and 13.6 g. (0.591 g.-atom) of freshly cut sodium (Note 4). The mixture is heated to reflux, and the molten sodium is broken up with the stirrer. A solution of 20.0 g.

The product in the traps is separated from any dioxane with the vacuum manifold system shown in Figure 1 (Note 8). The two traps containing the product are cooled in liquid nitrogen and connected to one of the stopcocks on the manifold. A gas storage bulb (Figure 2) is attached to the other stopcock. All the stopcocks are opened, and the system is evacuated. The stopcock to the pump is then closed, and the liquid nitrogen bath is removed from the traps and used to cool the gas storage bulb.

About 50 ml. of dry ether is placed in the dropping funnel, and the addition rate is set at 2\u20133 ml./minute (Note 3). After this addition 150 ml. of 1.6 N (0.24 mole) methyllithium (Note 4) in ether is added to the dropping funnel and dropped into the reaction flask over 1 hour (Note 5), while the cooling bath temperature is maintained at 20\u201325\u00b0. The yellow-orange solution is stirred for 8\u20139 hours, during which time lithium p-toluenesulfinate precipitates and the solution develops a deep red-orange color. A small amount of water is carefully added to destroy excess methyllithium before an additional 200 ml. is added. The layers are separated, the organic phase is washed with four 250-ml. portions of water, and the combined aqueous phases are shaken twice with 100-ml. portions of ether. After drying the combined ethereal extracts over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the volume of the solution is reduced to 50\u201360 ml. by distillation of the ether through a 25-cm. Vigreux column with gentle boiling on a steam bath. After 100 ml. of distilled pentane (Note 6) is added to the orange solution, the solvent is again gently boiled away, reducing the volume to 30\u201350 ml. The addition and removal of pentane is repeated two additional times to assure the complete removal of ether, and the final volume of the solution of 2-bornene is reduced to 30\u201340 ml. The solution is added to an 80 \u00d7 5 cm. chromatography column packed with 500 g. of alumina (Note 7), and the product is eluted with 750 ml. of pentane. After concentration of the eluate by distillation of the solvent through a Vigreux column, the residue is transferred to a 50-ml. flask and distilled through a U-tube with the aid of an oil bath and a heating lamp (Note 8). After collecting a forerun (pentane and 2-bornene), 8.5\u20138.8 g.

            "A 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a 25-cm. Vigreux column attached to a trap cooled in an acetone\u2013dry ice mixture is charged with 100 ml. of diethyl phthalate (Note 1) and 43 g. (0.30 mole) of tetracyanoethylene oxide (Note 2). The dropping funnel is charged with 44 g. (0.30 mole) of distilled n-butyl sulfide, the pressure is reduced to 5\u201320 mm. with a water aspirator, and the reaction flask is warmed with a 50\u00b0 water bath. The n-butyl sulfide is added dropwise with stirring over 20\u201325 minutes, and the internal temperature is maintained at 50 \u00b1 2\u00b0 by controlling the temperature of the water bath. The reaction is exothermic at the start, but it is necessary to supply heat toward the end of the addition. The internal temperature is increased to 80\u00b0 over 10\u201315 minutes after the sulfide has been added. The vacuum on the system is released by the introduction of nitrogen. The solid carbonyl cyanide that has collected in the trap is allowed to warm to room temperature under nitrogen, and 2 g. of tetracyanoethylene oxide (Note 3) and a boiling stone are added. The mixture is then warmed to 50\u00b0, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure (5\u201320 mm.) into a second trap cooled in an acetone\u2013dry ice mixture. Another portion of tetracyanoethylene oxide (1 g.) is added to the distillate, and the carbonyl cyanide is distilled, again under reduced pressure (5\u201320 mm.), into a distillation flask cooled in acetone\u2013dry ice mixture. Fractionation of the distillate through a 20-cm. column packed with glass helices gives 20.8\u201321.8 g. (86\u201391%) (Note 4) of faintly yellow carbonyl cyanide, b.p. 65\u201366\u00b0 (Note 5), (Note 6), and (Note 7)."

            "A. 5,9-Dithiaspiro[3.5]nonane. A dry, 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar (Note 1) is flushed with dry nitrogen (Note 2), and 1.25 l. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) and 50 g. (0.42 mole) of 1,3-dithiane (Note 4) are added. The flask is quickly equipped with a three-way stopcock bearing a standard tapered joint, a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet, as shown in Figure 1 (Note 5). The solution is stirred with an efficient magnetic stirrer and cooled to an external temperature of \u221220\u00b0 with a methanol\u2013dry ice bath. A 3% excess (total of 0.43 mole) of 1.5\u20132.5 M n-butyllithium in n-hexane (Note 6) is added through the rubber septum with a syringe. The bath temperature is kept between \u221210\u00b0 and \u221220\u00b0 for 2 hours before the temperature of the bath is reduced to \u221275\u00b0 (Note 7) and 65.5 g. (44.5 ml., 0.417 mole) of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (Note 8) is added with a syringe over 10 minutes. The temperature of the bath is raised to \u221230\u00b0 over a 2-hour period by gradually replacing the cold methanol with warm methanol. The bath is removed and stirring is continued until the reaction flask is at room temperature (Note 9). The flask is again cooled to \u221275\u00b0 (Note 7) and 0.44 mole of n-butyllithium in n-hexane (Note 6) is added with a syringe over 10 minutes. After the addition is complete, the temperature of the reaction flask is allowed to rise to room temperature overnight (Note 10). The solvent is removed from the product with a rotary evaporator at 50\u00b0 and aspirator pressure. Water (300 ml.) and diethyl ether (500 ml.) are added to the product in the flask, the ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is washed again with 500 ml. of ether. The organic layers are combined, washed with 200 ml. of water, and dried over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation to yield about 75 g. of crude product. Distillation through a packed column gives 44\u201357 g. (65\u201384%) of 5,9-dithiaspiro[3.5]nonane, b.p. 65\u201375\u00b0 (1 mm.), n20D 1.5700. This product is of sufficient purity for use in Part B (Note 11).\nFigure 1.",
            "B. Cyclobutanone. A 2-l., three-necked flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and a water-cooled condenser assembled for downward distillation to which is attached a 250-ml. receiver with a side arm. Two cold traps are attached consecutively to the distillation apparatus as shown in Figure 2 (Note 12). The receiver is immersed in an ice-water bath, and the traps are immersed in dry ice and acetone. To the flask is added 45 g. (0.28 mole) of 5,9-dithiaspiro[3.5]nonane, 900 ml. of triethylene glycol, and 150 ml. of water. Stirring is begun, and 163 g. (0.600 mole) of mercury(II) chloride (Note 13) and 51.5 g. (0.300 mole) of cadmium carbonate (Note 13) are added. A nitrogen-inlet tube reaching to the bottom of the flask is inserted into the third neck of the flask, and nitrogen is introduced at approximately 50 ml. per minute. The reaction flask is heated to 90\u00b0 in an oil bath, and the temperature is slowly increased to 110\u00b0 over a 2\u20133 hour period. Water and cyclobutanone are carried into the receivers. The water in the receiving flask is saturated with sodium chloride, and the resulting solution is transferred to a separatory funnel. The flask is rinsed with 25 ml. of dichloromethane, and this solution is used for an initial washing of the aqueous solution. The aqueous solution is shaken three additional times with 25-ml. portions of 12chloromethane. The dichloromethane solutions are combined and added to the traps to dissolve cyclobutanone. The resulting solution is transferred to a 250-ml. flask, the traps are rinsed with a small amount of dichloromethane, and the rinse is combined with the original solution. The organic solution is dried over 5 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 20-cm., helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The product is transferred to a 25-ml. flask, 5 ml. of mesitylene is added, and the product is distilled through a spinning-band column. The fraction boiling at 95\u2013100\u00b0 is collected, yielding 12\u201315.8 g. (60\u201381%) (Note 14) of cyclobutanone.\nFigure 2."

The brown mixture is stirred vigorously for 2 hours at 0\u20135\u00b0, then for 6 hours at room temperature.

            "A 2-l., three-necked flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube extending almost to the bottom of the flask, and an efficient reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. After the apparatus has been dried in an oven, 800 ml. of dichloromethane (Note 1) and 157 g. (142 ml., 2.00 moles) of acetyl chloride (Note 2) are added to the flask. This solution is stirred while 320 g. (2.40 moles) of powdered, anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 3) is added in portions over a 15-minute period. As soon as this addition is complete, a stream of propene gas (Note 4) is passed through the continuously stirred reaction solution at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux. The gas flow is continued until no more heat is evolved and refluxing ceases (10\u201330 hours, (Note 4), at which time the flask is nearly full and the contents separate into two layers after stirring is stopped. The contents of the flask are poured cautiously onto about 1.5 kg. of ice (Note 5), and the upper organic layer is separated. The aqueous phase is shaken with three 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane (Note 6), and the combined organic solutions are washed with 50 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.\nThe resulting dark brown solution is placed in a 2-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a magnetic stirring bar, a heating mantle, and an assembly consisting of a distilling head, a condenser, and a receiver which permits distillation under reduced pressure. The bulk of the dichloromethane and volatile hydrocarbons are distilled from the mixture at water-aspirator pressure while sufficient heat is supplied with the heating mantle, maintaining the temperature of the mixture at about 0\u00b0 (Note 7). When the bulk of the solvent has been removed, a 1-l., round-bottomed flask, cooled in a 2-propanol\u2013dry ice bath, is attached to the apparatus as a receiver, and the pressure is reduced to 1 mm. or less with a vacuum pump. With the heating mantle, the temperature of the viscous liquid in the distillation flask is raised slowly from about 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 over a period of 90 minutes, distilling the volatile products (dichloromethane, low molecular-weight hydrocarbons, 4-chloropentan-2-one, and 3-penten-2-one) (Note 7). The resulting distillate (400\u2013500 g. of pale green liquid) is mixed with 256 g. (1.98 moles) of quinoline (Note 8) and heated to boiling. To remove the remaining dichloromethane and other low-boiling materials (Note 9), liquid is allowed to distil from the mixture until the temperature of the distilling liquid reaches 110\u2013120\u00b0. The remaining solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, then cooled and diluted with the previously removed distillate and 200 ml. of pentane. The resulting solution is washed with successive 250-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid until the aqueous washings are acidic. The aqueous washings are combined, acidified, and shaken with three 100-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic solutions are washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The resulting organic solution is fractionally distilled through a 30-cm. Vigreux column, and 42\u201363 g. (25\u201337%) of crude product is collected in the fraction boiling at 119\u2013124\u00b0. This contains 3-penten-2-one of 86\u201392% purity (Note 10). If greater purity is desired, the crude product may be distilled through a 60-cm., spinning band column. Since this distillation may be accompanied by partial isomerization of the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone to the lower boiling \u03b2,\u03b3-isomer (Note 10), the product from the fractional distillation should be subjected to an acid-catalyzed equilibration. In a typical purification 79.4 g. of a mixture of penten-2-one isomers, b.p. 117\u2013119\u00b0, from a fractional distillation, is mixed with 400 mg. of p-toluenesulfonic acid and refluxed for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture is diluted with 100 ml. of diethyl ether and washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The resulting ether solution is fractionally distilled through a 16-cm. Vigreux column, giving 60.4 g. of trans-3-penten-2-one of 97% purity, b.p. 121.5\u2013124\u00b0, n25D 1.4329 (Note 11)."

A small piece of sodium is added to the stirred ammonia. After the appearance of a blue color a few crystals of iron(III) nitrate hydrate (about 0.25 g.) are added, followed by small pieces of freshly cut sodium until 18.4 g.

The mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature for about 2 hours to dissolve as much of the solid reactants as possible before 50.0 g. (0.500 mole) of isopropenyl acetate (Note 4) is added rapidly through the dropping funnel; the reaction starts immediately as indicated by a rise in temperature to about 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. The mixture is refluxed for 15 minutes with continuous stirring. The hot reaction mixture, which contains a sticky oil, is poured into a stirred mixture of 200 ml. of 12 M hydrochloric acid and 1000 g. of crushed ice, and the reaction flask is rinsed with part of the acidic aqueous phase. When the dark mass has dissolved, 200 ml. of 12 M hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is stirred vigorously for about 3 hours (Note 5). The dichloroethane phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with eight 600-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The extracts are combined with the dichloroethane phase (Note 6) and extracted first with 600 ml. and then twice with 200-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution.

The acidic solution (Note 7) is extracted first with 600 ml. and then with four 400-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The bulk of the dichloromethane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure and water bath temperatures; however, the last 150 ml. of solvent is removed below room temperature under reduced pressure (about 20 mm.), leaving 24\u201327 g. of crude 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione as a light brown solid, m.p. 68\u201371\u00b0 (Note 8).\nThe crude product is purified by decolorization with charcoal and recrystallization from 100\u2013150 ml. of diisopropyl ether, giving 19\u201321 g.

A dry, 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a drying tube, is charged with 500 ml. of anhydrous pyridine (Note 2), which is stirred and cooled to approximately 15\u00b0 (Note 3) with an ice bath. The drying tube is periodically removed and 68 g. (0.68 mole) of anhydrous chromium(VI) oxide (Note 4) is added in portions through the neck of the flask over a 30-minute period. The chromium trioxide should be added at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 20\u00b0 and in such a manner that the oxide mixes rapidly with the pyridine and does not adhere to the side of the flask (Note 5). As the chromium trioxide is added, an intensely yellow, flocculent precipitate separates from the pyridine and the viscosity of the mixture increases. When the addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. Within one hour the viscosity of the mixture decreases and the initially yellow product changes to a deep red, macrocrystalline form that settles to the bottom of the flask when stirring is discontinued. The supernatant pyridine is decanted from the complex and the crystals are washed several times by decantation with 250-ml. portions of anhydrous petroleum ether. The product is collected by filtration on a sintered glass funnel and washed with anhydrous petroleum ether, avoiding contact with the atmosphere as much as possible. The complex is dried at 10 mm. until it is free-flowing, leaving 150\u2013160 g. (85\u201391%) of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide3 as red crystals. The product is extremely hygroscopic; contact with moisture converts it rapidly to the yellow dipyridinium dichromate.4 It is stored at 0\u00b0 in a brown bottle (Note 6).",
            "B. General oxidation procedure for alcohols. A sufficient quantity of a 5% solution of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide (Note 1) in anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 7) is prepared to provide a sixfold molar ratio of complex to alcohol, an excess usually required for complete oxidation to the aldehyde. The freshly prepared, pure complex dissolves completely in dichloromethane at 25\u00b0 at 5% concentration, giving a deep red solution, but solutions usually contain small amounts of brown, insoluble material when prepared from crude complex (Note 8). The alcohol, either pure or as a solution in anhydrous dichloromethane, is added to the red solution in one portion with stirring at room temperature or lower. The oxidation of unhindered primary (and secondary) alcohols proceeds to completion within 5 to 15 minutes at 25\u00b0 with deposition of brownish-black, polymeric, reduced chromium\u2013pyridine products (Note 9). When deposition of reduced chromium compounds is complete (monitoring the reaction by GC or TLC is helpful), the supernatant liquid is decanted from the (usually tarry) precipitate, which is rinsed thoroughly with dichloromethane (Note 10).\nThe combined dichloromethane solutions may be washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and water, or filtered directly through a filter aid, or passed through a chromatographic column to remove traces of pyridine and chromium salts. The product is obtained by removal of dichloromethane; any pyridine that remains can often be removed under reduced pressure.",

Stirring is begun and 77.5 g. (0.300 mole) of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide (Note 1) is added at room temperature, followed by 5.8 g. (0.050 mole) of 1-heptanol (Note 11) in one portion. After stirring for 20 minutes, the supernatant solution is decanted from the insoluble brown gum, which is washed with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether and dichloromethane solutions are combined and washed successively with 300 ml. of aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide, 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid (Note 12), two 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and, finally, with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride.

            "The electrolysis cell (Note 1) is assembled in a 1000-ml., flat-bottomed Pyrex reaction kettle. The Pyrex cover contains four standard taper outer joints in which are mounted: (1) a 11.5 \u00d7 2-cm.-diameter carbon rod (Note 2) surrounded by a 15 \u00d7 5.5-cm.-diameter, porous, porcelain cup (Note 3); (2) a 31-cm. \u00d7 8-mm.-diameter length of soda-lime glass tubing (Note 4) with a short length of 0.6-mm.-diameter platinum wire fused into the bottom: (3) a tee-tube fitted to hold a thermometer and to allow nitrogen to be passed into the reaction vessel: and (4) a saturated calomel reference electrode fitted with successive salt bridges containing aqueous 1 M sodium nitrate and 1.5 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 5). The cover is also equipped with a suitable clamp so that it may be fastened to the reaction kettle during the electrolysis.\nA sufficient quantity of mercury (about 700 g.) is added to the reaction kettle to form a cathode pool 1-cm. deep, and a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar is placed on this mercury pool. A solution of 25.0 g. (0.0651 mole) of pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (Note 6) in 250 ml. of 0.2 M tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (Note 7) in N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 8) is added to the reaction vessel. An additional 175 ml. (Note 9) of 0.2 M tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (Note 7) in N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 8) is added to the porous porcelain cup surrounding the carbon-rod anode, and the cover is clamped to the reaction kettle. The glass tubing with a platinum wire contact sealed in the bottom is adjusted so that all of the exposed platinum is below the mercury surface (Note 10). The bottom of the porous porcelain cup should be a sufficient distance above the mercury pool so as not to interfere with the magnetic stirring bar. The salt bridge associated with the calomel reference electrode (Note 5) should be adjusted so that the lower, porous Vycor plug is between 5 and 10 mm. above the surface of the mercury pool. Before the electrolysis is begun a 0.5-ml. aliquot of the reaction solution should be removed from the cathode compartment and analyzed polarographically (Note 11), and the electrical resistances between the cathode and anode and between the cathode and the reference electrode should be measured with a suitable resistance bridge (Note 12). If all electrical connections are satisfactory the cathode-anode resistance should be in the range 20\u201330 ohms and the cathode-reference resistance should be in the range 5000\u201315,000 ohms. The electrical leads from the anode and cathode should be connected with a direct current source whose potential may be conveniently adjusted from 0 to 40 volts with a continuous current output of at least 1 amp. A suitable d.c. voltmeter is mounted in parallel with the anode and cathode leads, and a d.c. ammeter, capable of measuring currents of 0 to 3 amps is placed in series in either of the two leads. Finally, a vacuum-tube d.c. voltmeter or some equivalent high-impedance (Note 13) potential measuring device is connected to measure the potential difference between the cathode and the reference electrode. The reaction kettle should be placed in a nonmagnetic bath, to which cooling water may be added if necessary and magnetic stirring started. A very slow stream of nitrogen (1\u20132 ml. per minute) is passed through the apparatus throughout the electrolysis (Note 14). The potential of the direct current source is adjusted, giving a potential difference of 1.7 to 1.8 volts between the cathode and the reference electrode (Note 15), and the current source is adjusted at 10\u201315 minute intervals to maintain this potential difference throughout the electrolysis. It is convenient to keep a record of time and the current passing through the cell so that the time when the theoretical amount of electricity (12,500 coulombs or 3.5 amp.-hours) has been passed through the cell can be estimated (Note 16). During the electrolysis the temperature of the catholyte solution is kept below 40\u00b0 (Note 17) by the use of external cooling if necessary. When approximately the theoretical amount of electricity has been passed through the electrolysis cell ((Note 16), typically 4\u20136 hours), a 0.5-ml. aliquot is removed and analyzed polarographically (Note 11). The electrolysis is continued until the polarographic analysis (Note 11) indicates the consumption of practically all the pentaerythrityl tetrabromide.\nThe solutions are removed from the cathode and anode (Note 18) compartments and added to 200 ml. of water. The resulting mixture is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined pentane extracts are washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation through a short Vigreux column (Note 19). The remaining pentane is removed by distillation and the residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 6.9\u20138.5 g. (47\u201358%) of 1,1-bis-(bromomethyl)cyclopropane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 65\u201367\u00b0 (5 mm.), nD25 1.5341\u20131.5347 (Note 20)."

Since mixtures of perchloric acid with small amounts of organic material can explode violently, the perchloric acid should always be the last component added to the reaction mixture.\nTo a 1-l. flask are added 600 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, 270 g. (250 ml., 2.65 moles) of acetic anhydride, 56 g. (0.50 mole) of 2-methylcyclohexanone, and 0.34 ml. (0.002 mole) of 70% perchloric acid. The reaction flask is stoppered and allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hours during which time the reaction solution becomes first yellow-orange and finally red in color. The reaction mixture is poured into a cold (0\u20135\u00b0) mixture of 400 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and 400 ml. of pentane contained in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. While the mixture is stirred vigorously at 0\u20135\u00b0, solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is added in 3\u20135 g. portions as rapidly as foaming of the reaction mixture will permit. The addition of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is continued until the acetic acid has been neutralized and the aqueous phase remains slightly basic (pH 8). This neutralization requires approximately 400 g. of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate added in portions over a period of ca. 3 hours. As soon as the neutralization is complete (Note 1), the organic layer (the lower layer) is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by distilling the bulk of the pentane through a 30-cm. Vigreux column. The remaining solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator and the residual liquid is distilled (Note 2) under reduced pressure, yielding 66.6\u201370.9 g.

Therefore any manipulations with this reagent must be carried out with the utmost care to avoid accidental spillage. Benzyl bromide is a powerful lachrymator. Steps B and C should be performed in an efficient fume hood.\nA 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a nitrogen-inlet tube fitted with a stopcock, a glass joint fitted with a rubber septum, a 125-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a glass-covered magnetic stirring bar. After the apparatus has been dried in an oven, 20 mg. of 2,2'-bipyridyl is added to the flask and the apparatus is thoroughly flushed with anhydrous, oxygen-free nitrogen (Note 4). A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout subsequent operations involving organometallic reagents (Note 5). An ethereal solution containing 0.40 mole of methyllithium (Note 6) is added to the reaction vessel with a hypodermic syringe. The diethyl ether is removed by evacuating the apparatus while the solution is stirred and the flask is warmed with a water bath (40\u00b0) (Note 7). The reaction vessel is refilled with nitrogen and 400 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (b.p. 83\u00b0, freshly distilled from lithium aluminum hydride) is transferred to the reaction vessel with a hypodermic syringe or a stainless steel cannula. The resulting purple solution of methyllithium and the methyllithium bipyridyl charge-transfer complex is cooled to 0\u201310\u00b0 before 29.3 g. (0.190 mole) of 2-methyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl acetate is added, dropwise and with stirring, over a period of 35\u201345 minutes (Note 8) while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 0\u201310\u00b0 with an ice bath.

The same precaution as that described in part B should be exercised in this step.\nA 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped as described in part B. After the assembled apparatus has been dried in an oven, 45 mg. of 2,2'-bipyridyl is added to the flask and the apparatus is thoroughly flushed with anhydrous, oxygen-free nitrogen (Note 4). A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout subsequent operations involving organometallic reagents (Note 5). An ethereal solution containing 0.20 mole of methyllithium (Note 6) is added to the reaction flask with a hypodermic syringe. After the ether is removed under reduced pressure as described in part B (Note 7), the reaction vessel is refilled with nitrogen and 400 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (b.p. 83\u00b0, freshly distilled from lithium aluminum hydride) is added to the vessel with a hypodermic syringe or a stainless steel cannula. The resulting purple solution of methyllithium and the methyllithium-bipyridyl charge-transfer complex is cooled to \u221250\u00b0 with a dry ice\u2013methanol bath before 21.0 g.

During this addition, which requires 2\u20133 minutes, the temperature of the reaction solution should not be allowed to rise above \u221220\u00b0 (Note 12). The resulting reddish-purple solution of lithium diisopropylamide and the bipyridyl charge-transfer complex is stirred at \u221220\u00b0 for 2\u20133 minutes before 50 ml. of a 1,2-dimethoxyethane solution containing 21.3 g. (0.190 mole) of 2-methylcyclohexanone is added, dropwise and with stirring. During this addition the temperature of the reaction solution should not be allowed to rise above 0\u00b0 (Note 12). After the addition of the ketone, the solution of the lithium enolate must still retain a pale reddish-purple color indicating the presence of a slight excess of lithium diisopropylamide (Note 9) and (Note 13). The enolate solution is stirred and warmed to 30\u00b0 with a water bath before 68.4 g. (0.400 mole) of freshly distilled benzyl bromide [b.p. 78\u201379\u00b0 (12 mm.), nD25 1.5738] is added, rapidly and with vigorous stirring, from a hypodermic syringe. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to about 50\u00b0 within 2 minutes and then begins to fall. After a total reaction period of 6 minutes, the reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml. of cold (0\u201310\u00b0), saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and extracted with three 150-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic extracts are washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator.

The crude reaction product contains (Note 11) and (Note 15) 2-benzyl-6-methylcyclohexanone (86\u201390%) and 2-benzyl-2-methylcyclohexanone (10\u201314%) accompanied in some cases by small amounts of trans-stilbene (Note 13).\nTo obtain the pure 2,6-isomer, the following procedure may be followed. A 200-ml. flask, equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, dried in an oven, and flushed with nitrogen, is charged with 2.59 g. (0.0479 mole) of sodium methoxide (Note 16) and stoppered with a rubber septum. A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the remainder of the reaction. Using a hypodermic syringe, 90 ml. of ether (freshly distilled from lithium aluminum hydride) is added to the flask. The resulting suspension is cooled with an ice bath before a mixture of the crude, distilled, alkylated product (about 21\u201323 g.) and 3.74 g. (0.0505 mole) of ethyl formate (Note 17) is added with a hypodermic syringe. The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes with ice-bath cooling. The bath is then removed and stirring is continued for an additional 50 minutes. The resulting yellow suspension is treated with 300 ml. of water and extracted with 250 ml. of ether. The ethereal extract is washed with 100 ml. of aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 16.2\u201317.3 g.

A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 750 ml. of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol (Note 1). As the tert-butyl alcohol is slowly stirred, a stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask and 12.2 g. (0.312 g.-atom) of potassium metal is added cautiously. The flask is surrounded by a water bath maintained at 70\u00b0 to assist in dissolving the potassium metal. After 1.5 hours the stirred mixture is homogeneous, the water bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. To the potassium tert-butoxide solution is slowly added 45.0 g. (0.156 mole) of dehydroisoandrosterone (Note 2), and stirring is continued for one hour until the gold-colored mixture is again homogeneous. To the reaction mixture is now added, dropwise, 36.5 g.

The addition of 400 ml. of diethyl ether assists in effecting the separation of the clear, yellow, aqueous, lower layer from the fluffy-white ethereal suspension that forms the upper layer. This suspension is filtered through a 250-ml. coarse sintered glass funnel, and the precipitate of oximino ketone is washed with ether several times.

Through the dropping funnel 133 ml. of 3.0 M aqueous sodium hypochlorite (0.40 mole) is added dropwise. The sodium hypochlorite solution should be kept near 0\u00b0; 25-ml. portions should be added to the addition funnel and the remaining solution should be kept in an ice bath (Note 8). It is important that the rate of addition of the sodium hypochlorite, and the position of the ice bath be adjusted so as to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture at 20\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0 (Note 9). As soon as all of the sodium hypochlorite has been added, the ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 6 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is diluted with an equal volume of water and extracted with 400-ml. and 200-ml. portions of dichloromethane.

(0.0239 mole) of 16-diazoandrost-5-en-3\u03b2-ol-17-one. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a quartz immersion well, and a nitrogen inlet. After the reaction vessel has been flushed with nitrogen, the diazo ketone solution is irradiated for 48 hours with a 450-watt Hanovia lamp with a Corex filter (Note 11). The photolysis mixture is decanted in portions into a 2-l. separatory funnel, washed three times with 500-ml. portions of water, removing the dioxane, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is evaporated, leaving a pale-yellow residue. The residue is digested with 125 ml. of boiling dichloromethane under reflux for 30 minutes. The dichloromethane solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered, separating about 1.4 g. of the crude \u03b1-isomer as a white powder.

The excess hydride is destroyed by the slow, dropwise addition of 8 ml. of methanol (Note 9), followed by the addition in one portion of 36.6 ml. of 3 M aqueous sodium hydroxide. The borinic acid intermediate is now oxidized by the dropwise addition of 24 ml. of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Note 10) to the well-stirred reaction mixture at 35\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 (Note 11). After the hydrogen peroxide addition is complete, the ice-water bath is replaced with a warm-water bath and the reaction mixture is stirred for one hour at 50\u201355\u00b0 (Note 12) and then cooled to room temperature. The aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and 50 ml. of diethyl ether is added. The upper organic layer is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The organic layer and extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated to an oil on a rotary evaporator at 60\u00b0 (15 mm.) (Note 13). The crude product is fractionally distilled using a 30-cm. column packed with glass helices, giving 24.7 g. (80%) of (\u2212)-isopinocampheol, b.p. 60\u201365\u00b0 (0.1 mm.) (Note 14). The distillate crystallizes completely in the receiver, m.p. 49\u201355\u00b0, 97.5% purity by GC, [\u03b1]19D \u221234.3\u00b0 (C, 20 in ethanol) (Note 15). Slurrying 4.7 g. in 2.3 ml. of pentane at room temperature, cooling to \u221278\u00b0, collecting on a filter, and air drying gives 3.8 g. of crystalline (\u2212)-isopinocampheol, m.p. 52\u201355\u00b0, purity 99.2% by GC, [\u03b1]19D \u221234.9\u00b0 (C, 20 in ethanol).",
            "In a 300-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer (Note 1) are placed 3.1 g. (0.080 mole) of sodium borohydride, 100 ml. of diglyme (Note 2), and 27.2 g. (0.200 mole) of (-)-\u03b1-pinene (Note 3) diluted with 20 ml. of diglyme. The flask is immersed in a water bath (20-25\u00b0). Diborane is generated by dropwise addition of 14 ml. (0.11 mole, d20 1.125) of boron trifluoride etherate (Note 4) to the well-stirred reaction mixture over a period of 15 minutes. The diisopinocampheylborane precipitates as white solid as the reaction proceeds. The mixture is maintained for an additional hour at room temperature. The excess hydride is then decomposed by dropwise addition of 20 ml. of water (Note 5). The organoborane formed (R2BOH) is oxidized a 30-50\u00b0 (water bath) by adding in one portion of 22 ml. of aqueous 3M sodium hydroxide, followed by the dropwise addition of 22 ml. of aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide to the well stirred reaction mixture. The flask is kept for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature.\nThe alcohol reaction mixture is extracted with 200 ml. of ether and the ether extract is washed five times with equal volumes of ice water to remove the diglyme. The ether extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the ether is removed by distillation through a short Vigreux column. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to separate 26.2 g. (85%) of isopinocampheol, b.p. 80-82\u00b0 (2 mm.). The distillate crystallizes immediately in the collection flask (Note 6). The crystals melt at 50-52\u00b0 (Note 7). Recrystallization from about 10 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 35-37\u00b0) affords pure isopinocampheol as needles, m.p. 55-57\u00b0, [\u03b1]20 D +32.8\u00b0 (c, 10 in benzene)."

A dry, 5-l., three-necked flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer. An inlet tube at the top of the reflux condenser is used to maintain a static nitrogen atmosphere in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. The flask is charged with 330 g. (3.00 moles) of catechol (Note 2) and 2 l. of commercial n-butanol before stirring is started, and 122 g. (3.05 moles) of sodium hydroxide pellets are added. The mixture is heated rapidly to reflux (about 115\u00b0), and a solution of 222 g. (1.55 moles) of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether (Note 3) in 150 ml. of n-butanol is added, dropwise with continuous stirring and heating, over a 2-hour period. After the resulting mixture has been refluxed with stirring for an additional hour, it is cooled to 90\u00b0 and an additional 122 g. (3.05 moles) of sodium hydroxide pellets are added. The mixture is refluxed, with stirring, for 30 minutes, and a solution of 222 g. (1.55 moles) of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether (Note 3) in 150 ml. of n-butanol is added, dropwise with stirring and heating, over a period of 2 hours. The final reaction mixture is refluxed, with stirring, for 16 hours (Note 4), then acidified by the dropwise addition of 21 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reflux condenser is replaced with a distillation head and approximately 700 ml. of n-butanol is distilled from the mixture. As the distillation is continued, water is added to the flask from the dropping funnel at a sufficient rate to maintain a constant volume in the reaction flask. This distillation is continued until the temperature of the distilling vapor exceeds 99\u00b0 (Note 5), and the resulting slurry is cooled to 30\u201340\u00b0, diluted with 500 ml. of acetone, stirred to coagulate the precipitate, and filtered with suction. The residual crude product is stirred with 2 l. of water, filtered with suction, stirred with 1 l. of acetone, and again filtered with suction. The residual product is washed with an additional 500 ml. of acetone and dried with suction, yielding 221\u2013260 g. (39\u201348%) of tan, fibrous crystals, m.p. 161\u2013162\u00b0, which are sufficiently pure for use in the next step.

After the autoclave has been closed, it is flushed with nitrogen and filled with hydrogen. The mixture is hydrogenated at 100\u00b0 and a hydrogen pressure of about 70 atm. (1000 p.s.i.) until the theoretical amount of hydrogen (2.08 moles) has been absorbed. The autoclave is cooled to room temperature and vented, and the reaction mixture is filtered to remove the catalyst (Note 9). The filtrate is concentrated at 90\u2013100\u00b0 with a rotary evaporator (Note 10), and the residual crude product solidifies on standing (Note 11). To remove hydroxylic impurities, a solution of the crude product (about 130 g.) in 400 ml. of n-heptane is filtered through a 7-cm. by 20-cm. column of acid-washed alumina (80\u2013100 mesh, activity I\u2013II), and the column is eluted with additional n-heptane until the eluate exhibits hydroxyl absorption in the 3300\u20133400 cm\u22121 region of the IR.

(4.11 moles) of potassium permanganate in 3 l. of water, contained in a 5-l., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel, is added, dropwise and with stirring over a 10- minute period, 100 g. (1.37 moles) of tert-butylamine (Note 1). When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to 55\u00b0 over a period of approximately 2 hours, and maintained at 55\u00b0 with continuous stirring for 3 hours. The dropping funnel and reflux condenser are replaced with a stopper and a still head fitted for steam distillation, and the product is steam distilled from the reaction mixture (Note 2). The liquid product is separated from the denser water layer, diluted with 250 ml. of diethyl ether, and washed successively with two 50-ml. portions of 2 M hydrochloric acid and 50 ml. of water. After the ethereal solution has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solution is fractionally distilled at atmospheric pressure, removing the ether. The residual crude product (Note 3) totals 106\u2013128 g. and is sufficiently pure for use in the next step. In a typical run, distillation of 124 g. of the crude product affords 110 g. (78%) of the pure 2-methyl-2-nitropropane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 127\u2013128\u00b0, n25D 1.3992, which slowly solidifies on standing to a waxy solid, m.p. 25\u201326\u00b0 (Note 4).",
            "B. N-tert-Butylhydroxylamine. Caution! Since hydrogen may be liberated during the reduction with aluminum amalgam, the reaction should be conducted in a hood. Also, the aluminum amalgam may be pyrophoric. Consequently, it should be used immediately and not allowed to become dry.\nAluminum foil (30 g. or 1.1 g.-atoms, thickness 0.002\u20130.003 cm.) is cut into strips 5 \u00d7 25 cm., and each strip is rolled into a cylinder about 1 cm. in diameter. Each of the aluminum foil cylinders is amalgamated by immersing it in a solution of 8.0 g. (0.030 mole) of mercury(II) chloride in 400 ml. of water for 15 seconds. Each amalgamated cylinder is then rinsed successively in ethanol and ether, and added to a mixture of 1.5 l. of ether and 15 ml. of water (Note 5) contained in a 3-l., three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and two efficient reflux condensers in series. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously, and 60 g. (0.58 mole) of 2-methyl-2-nitropropane is added dropwise at a rate such that the ether refluxes briskly. The reaction usually exhibits a 5- to 7-minute induction period, after which a vigorous reaction occurs and cooling with an ice bath is necessary. After addition of the nitro compound is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The stirrer is then stopped and the gelatinous precipitate is allowed to settle. The colorless reaction solution is decanted through a glass wool plug into a 2-l. separatory funnel and washed with two 250-ml. portions of 2 M aqueous sodium hydroxide (Note 6). The precipitate in the reaction flask is washed with two 500-ml. portions of ether, and these washings are combined and washed with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (Note 6). The combined ethereal solutions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual crystalline solid is dried under reduced pressure (10\u201315 mm.) at room temperature, leaving 33.7\u201338.7 g. (65\u201375%) of the crude hydroxylamine product, m.p. 59\u201360\u00b0, which is sufficiently pure for use in the next step. The crude product may be recrystallized from pentane, yielding the pure N-tert-butylhydroxylamine as white plates, m.p. 64\u201365\u00b0 (Note 7).",
            "C. 2-Methyl-2-nitrosopropane. A solution of sodium hypobromite is prepared by adding, dropwise and with stirring over a 5-minute period, 57.5 g. (18.5 ml., 0.360 mole) of bromine to a solution of 36.0 g. (0.900 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 225 ml. of water. The resulting yellow solution, contained in a 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an acetone\u2013dry ice cooling bath, is cooled to \u221220\u00b0. A suspension of 26.7 g. (0.300 mole) of N-tert-butylhydroxylamine in 50 ml. of water is added to the reaction flask, with continuous stirring, as rapidly as possible without allowing the temperature of the reaction mixture to exceed 0\u00b0. The reaction solution is again cooled to \u221220\u00b0 before the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 4 hours while the reaction mixture warms to room temperature. The solid product, the nitroso dimer which has separated, is collected on a sintered glass funnel, pulverized, and washed with 1 l. of water (Note 8). The residual solid is dried at room temperature under reduced pressure (10\u201315 mm.), leaving 19.6\u201322.2 g. (75\u201385%) of the 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane dimer, m.p. 80\u201381\u00b0 (Note 9). The product is sufficiently pure to be stored (Note 10) for use as a free radical trapping reagent."

            "A. Disodium nitrosodisulfonate. A 1-l., resin kettle equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a gas-inlet tube suspended about 0.5 cm. above the bottom of the vessel, and an ice-cooling bath is charged with 15.0 g. (0.217 mole) of sodium nitrite (Note 1), 16.8 g. (0.200 mole) of sodium hydrogen carbonate (Note 1), and 400 g. of ice. Sulfur dioxide (25.6 g., 0.400 mole, (Note 2)) is passed into the cold, initially heterogeneous mixture with stirring over a period of 40 minutes. Near the end of the sulfur dioxide addition, the light brown color of the reaction mixture fades almost completely. The resulting colorless to pale-yellow solution of disodium hydroxylaminedisulfonate (Note 3), which has an approximate pH of 4, is stirred for 10 minutes before 59.5 g. (0.480 mole) of sodium carbonate monohydrate (Note 1) is added, giving a solution of pH 11. The gas-inlet tube is removed from the reaction vessel and replaced with a rectangular anode constructed from a 3.5 cm. by 4.7 cm. piece of stainless-steel mesh (about 16 mesh/cm.2) with a stainless-steel wire as an electrical lead. The cathode is a cylindrical coil formed from a 1.5-mm. by 40-cm. piece of stainless-steel wire suspended in a 5-cm. by 10-cm. porous porcelain thimble filled with aqueous 10% sodium carbonate. The porcelain thimble containing the cathode is suspended in the reaction vessel so that the liquid levels in the anode and cathode compartments are the same. The cathode-anode resistance of the electrolysis cell should be in the range of 5\u201310 ohms. While the reaction solution is continuously stirred and maintained at a temperature of 12\u00b0 with an ice bath, the electrolysis is started by applying a sufficient potential (approximately 10 volts, (Note 4)) to the anode and cathode leads, giving a cell current of 2.0 amp. As the electrolysis proceeds, the potential applied to the cell is adjusted to maintain a cell current of 2.0 amp. The formation of the nitrosodisulfonate radical is evidenced by the appearance of a deep purple color (Note 5). The electrolysis is continued with stirring and cooling until quantitative measurement of the optical density of the reaction solution (Note 5), indicates the concentration of disodium nitrosodisulfonate to be 0.42\u20130.47 M (84\u201394% yield). The typical reaction time is 4 hours; the amount of electricity passed through the cell totals approximately 28,800 coulombs or 8 amp-hours (theoretically, 19,300 coulombs or 5.4 amp-hours). This solution of the nitrosodisulfonate radical is removed from the anode compartment of the electrolysis cell and used directly in the next step (Note 6).",
            "B. Trimethyl-p-benzoquinone. The aqueous solution containing approximately 0.17 mole of disodium nitrosodisulfonate is placed in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an ice bath. A solution of 10.0 g. (0.0734 mole) of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (Note 7) in 100 ml. of heptane is added to the reaction flask, and the resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 4 hours with continuous cooling, maintaining the reaction temperature below 12\u00b0. The yellow heptane layer is separated, and the brown aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of heptane. The combined heptane solutions are quickly (Note 8) washed with three 50-ml. portions of cold (0\u20135\u00b0), 4 M aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by two 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at 40\u00b0 with a rotary evaporator, yielding 10.0\u201310.9 g. (91\u201399%) of crude trimethyl-p-benzoquinone as a yellow liquid, which crystallizes when cooled below room temperature. Further purification may be accomplished by distillation under reduced pressure, yielding 8.5\u20138.7 g.

The assembly is connected to a nitrogen source (Note 1) through the vacuum take-off, and with the cylinder valve closed but the stopcock open, the system is alternately evacuated and filled with nitrogen four times. With the system filled with nitrogen the cylinder valve is opened and approximately 55 ml. (46 g; 0.40 mole) of triethylaluminum (Note 2) is allowed to flow into the reaction flask. The cylinder valve is then closed; the system is evacuated and filled three times with nitrogen, and the adaptor stopcock is then closed (Note 3). The reaction flask is then quickly removed, stoppered, and weighed to determine the exact amount of triethylaluminum collected. A magnetic stirring bar is added and the flask is fitted with a vacuum take-off and 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The system is again placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the triethylaluminum is dissolved in 150 ml. of anhydrous benzene, added through the dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 11.9 g. (0.441 mole) of hydrogen cyanide (Note 4) in 100 ml. of anhydrous benzene, which is added dropwise to the solution of triethylaluminum, with stirring and cooling. Preferably, the addition is carried out at a constant rate such that the hydrogen cyanide solution is added in about 2 hours. The evolution of ethane becomes slow suddenly after one molar equivalent of hydrogen cyanide is added (Note 5). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir overnight (Note 6).\nFigure 1. Apparatus for collection of triethylaluminum.\nAfter this period, the dropping funnel and the vacuum take-off are replaced by the short-path distillation assembly shown in Figure 2. The system is protected with a Drierite tube, and the benzene is distilled under reduced pressure (water aspirator). After the benzene is removed, the benzene-containing receiver is replaced with a clean, dry flask, and the system is connected to an efficient vacuum pump. The pressure in the system is reduced to 0.02 mm., and the flask is immersed deeply in an oil bath (Figure 2) heated to about 200\u00b0. After about 1 ml. of forerun is collected, diethylaluminum cyanide distils at 162\u00b0 (0.02 mm.) (Note 7) and is collected in a tared, 200-ml. receiver by heating the side arm and the adaptor with a stream of hot air or an IR lamp (Note 8). After all the distillate is collected in the receiver (Note 9), dry nitrogen is admitted to the evacuated apparatus, and the receiver is stoppered, giving 26.7\u201335.6 g. (60\u201380%) of diethylaluminum cyanide, usually as a pale, yellow syrup (Note 10) and (Note 11).\n>Figure 2. Short-path distillation apparatus.\nThe stopper of the flask is quickly replaced with the nitrogen adaptor, and after placing the system under a nitrogen atmosphere, the diethylaluminum cyanide is treated with 130 ml. of dry benzene. The resulting mixture is allowed to stand with occasional swirling under nitrogen until the syrup goes into solution (Note 12). Sufficient dry benzene is then added to make the total volume of the solution 200 ml. After thorough mixing with a magnetic stirring bar, the resulting diethylaluminum cyanide solution (13.4\u201317.8%; 1.2\u20131.6 M) may be divided and stored in sealed ampoules (Note 13)."

            "A 200-ml., two-necked round-bottomed flask charged with 6.15 g. (0.0347 mole) of 6-methoxy-1-tetralone (Note 1) and a 100 ml., round-bottomed flask are flushed with nitrogen, and each of the flasks is fitted with an adaptor with a side arm connected to a nitrogen bubbler system and then charged with 30 ml. of anhydrous toluene. The 200-ml. flask is cooled to \u221220\u00b0 to \u221225\u00b0 (bath temperature) (Note 2). Into the 100-ml. flask is introduced 60 ml. (0.07 mole) of a 13% solution of diethylaluminum cyanide in benzene (Note 3) with a hypodermic syringe, and this flask is cooled with ice water. The cooled diethylaluminum cyanide solution is added to the cold solution of 6-methoxytetralone with a hypodermic syringe and the resulting mixture, after being swirled, is kept at \u221215\u00b0 for 80 minutes under nitrogen. The stopper of the flask is replaced by a glass tube which has one end extending to the bottom of the reaction flask and the other end mounted in a neck of a 2-l., three-necked flask, equipped with an efficient stirrer and containning a cold (\u221270\u00b0) mixture of 250 ml. of methanol and 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid as shown in Figure 1. The reaction mixture is added through the glass tube to the vigorously stirred acid mixture by applying a positive nitrogen pressure to the reaction flask (Note 4). After the bulk of the reaction mixture is added, about 50 ml. of a cold mixture of methanol and hydrochloric acid is added to the reaction flask and this mixture is transferred to the 2-l. flask in the same way, as described above. Stirring is continued for one hour, and the resulting mixture is poured into a mixture of 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 l. of ice water (Note 5) and extracted with three 500-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are washed once with 1.5 l. of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated from a flask containing 55 mg. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 6). using a rotary evaporator at a temperature below 40\u00b0.\nFigure 1. Apparatus for acid treatment of the reaction mixture.\nThe residue, obtained as a pale yellow oil, weighs approximately 7.4 g. and consists of 1-cyano-1-hydroxy-6-methoxytetralin and a small amount of unchanged 6-methoxy-1-tetralone. The oil is transferred to a 10-ml. Claisen flask, a small amount of a mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether being used to complete the transfer. Two hundred milligrams of powdered potassium hydrogen sulfate is added, and the flask is heated at 130\u00b0 under reduced pressure (5 mm.) for 30 minutes. The pressure is then reduced to 0.01 mm. and the temperature is raised to about 150\u00b0, collecting all the distillate [b.p. 113\u2013117\u00b0 (0.01 mm.)] in a 50-ml. flask. The viscous distillate (including material adhering to the distillation apparatus), weighs 6.0\u20136.2 g. and yields 4.91\u20135.05 g. (76\u201378%) of product, m.p. 50\u201351.5\u00b0, after two or three crystallizations from methanol. The residue from the mother liquors (1.0\u20131.3 g.) is adsorbed on a column of 100 times its weight of silica gel (70\u2013325 mesh), and the column is eluted with approximately 1 l. of 40% ether in petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0). The first 200 ml. of eluent is discarded, and 510\u2013550 mg. of the product is eluted in the next 250 ml. of eluent. Crystallization of this material from an ether\u2013petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) mixture affords an additional 460\u2013500 mg. (7.0\u20137.8%) of pure product, m.p. 50.5\u201351.5\u00b0. The total yield of the unsaturated nitrile is 5.41\u20135.51 g. (83.8\u201385.5%). (Note 7). The final 500 ml. fraction from chromatography contains 330\u2013660 mg.

A dry, 100-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a nitrogen inlet tube, and a rubber septum is charged with 384 mg. (0.00201 mole) of copper(I) iodide (Note 1) and 20 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 2). After the reaction vessel has been flushed with nitrogen, a static oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the remainder of the reaction. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and an ether solution, containing 0.0040 mole of methyllithium (Note 3), is added with a hypodermic syringe, dropwise and with stirring. As the methyllithium is added, the initial yellow precipitate of polymeric methylcopper(I) redissolves, forming a colorless to pale-yellow solution of lithium dimethylcuprate (Note 4). To the resulting cold solution is added, dropwise and with stirring over 20 minutes, a solution of 576 mg. (0.00150 mole) of cholest-4-en-3-one (Note 5) in 20 ml. of ether (Note 2). During the addition of the enone, a yellow precipitate of polymeric methylcopper(I) separates from the reaction solution. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The dropping funnel is replaced with a second dry dropping funnel which contains a loose plug of glass wool above the stopcock. The reaction mixture is again cooled in an ice bath and a mixture of 4.0 ml. of triethylamine (Note 6) and 2.00 g. (0.0115 mole) of diethyl phosphorochloridate (Note 7) is added from the dropping funnel to the reaction mixture, rapidly and with stirring. After this addition, the cooling bath is removed, and stirring is continued for one hour. Saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate is added to hydrolyze any remaining organometallic reagents before the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed successively with two 50-ml. portions of cold (0\u00b0) 1 M ammonium hydroxide and a 50-ml. portion of water. The aqueous washes are extracted in turn with a 30-ml. portion of ether. The combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. A solution of the residual liquid in 3 ml. of ether is applied to a 2.5 cm. by 15 cm. chromatographic column packed with a slurry of 50 g. of silica gel (Note 8) in ether. The column is eluted with ether. After the first 70 ml. of eluent has been collected and discarded, the next 120 ml. of ether eluent is collected and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, yielding 420\u2013480 mg. of crude phosphate ester (Note 9), a colorless liquid, sufficiently pure for use in the following procedure.",

The reaction vessel is flushed with either helium or argon, and a static atmosphere of one of these gases is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. Ethylamine (Note 10) is distilled through a tower of sodium hydroxide pellets into the cold reaction flask until 50 ml. of the liquid amine has been collected. A 70-mg. (0.010 g.-atom) piece of lithium wire is cleaned by dipping it successively into methanol and pentane and added to the reaction flask. The resulting cold (\u221215\u00b0) mixture is stirred for 10 minutes to dissolve the lithium before a solution of the diethyl 5-methylcoprost-3-en-3-yl phosphate and 0.50 ml. (0.39 g., 0.0053 mole) of tert-butyl alcohol (Note 11) in 15 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (Note 2) is added, dropwise and with stirring over 15 minutes, to the cold, blue lithium\u2013amine solution. The blue solution is stirred for an additional 15 minutes before 1 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride is added to consume excess lithium. The resulting colorless mixture is warmed, evaporating ethylamine, and the residue is diluted with 90 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide and extracted with two 30-ml. portions of pentane.

The system is flushed with argon (Note 2), and 380 ml. of benzene (Note 3) is placed in the flask. From an inverted lecture cylinder 50.8 g. (38.5 ml., 0.298 mole) of nickel carbonyl (Note 4) is introduced into the addition funnel. The nickel carbonyl is added to the benzene while an atmosphere of argon is maintained, and the flask is immersed in an oil bath at 50\u00b0. With a syringe, 10.04 g. (0.07437 mole) of methallyl bromide (Note 5) is added over 10 minutes. After a short induction period, evolution of carbon monoxide becomes rapid and a deep red color appears. The exit gas is led from the top of the condenser through a gas bubbler tube to monitor the rate of gas evolution. As the gas evolution becomes vigorous, the bath temperature is raised to 70\u00b0 and maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes after gas evolution ceases (the total time after addition of methallyl bromide is 1.5 hours). The resulting solution is allowed to cool to 25\u00b0, and the benzene and excess nickel carbonyl are removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator), applying an oil bath at 30\u00b0 as needed to maintain a rapid rate of evaporation (Note 6). The residual, red, solid \u03c0-methallylnickel bromide (>85%) is used directly in the next step (Note 7).\nA solution of 9.95 g. (0.0634 mole) of bromobenzene (Note 8) in 100 ml. of oxygen-free N,N-dimethylformamide is added, under an argon atmosphere at 25\u00b0, to a solution of the crude nickel complex (an 85% yield is assumed) in 65 ml. of oxygen-free N,N-dimethylformamide, over a 15-minute period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0 for 12 hours, then warmed to 60\u00b0 for one hour. Complete reaction of the nickel complex is indicated by a red to emerald green color change, characteristic of a solution of nickel dibromide in N,N-dimethylformamide. After being cooled to 25\u00b0, the solution is poured into a mixture of 250 ml. of water and 250 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0); 2 ml. of 12 M hydrochloric acid is added (Note 10), and the mixture is filtered through Celite filter aid, facilitating separation of the layers. The organic layer is separated, washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure, affording 8.0\u20139.6 g. of a clear, colorless liquid. Distillation through a short Vigreux column gives 5.58\u20136.02 g.

            "A solution of 21.4 g. (0.262 mole) of dimethylamine hydrochloride in 150 ml. of methanol is prepared in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. Potassium hydroxide (4 g.) is added in one portion to the magnetically stirred solution (Note 1). When the pellets are completely dissolved, 19.6 g. (0.200 mole) of cyclohexanone is added in one portion. The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes before a solution of 4.75 g. (0.0754 mole) of sodium cyanoborohydride (Note 2) and (Note 3) in 50 ml. of methanol is added dropwise over 30 minutes to the stirred suspension. After the addition is complete, the suspension is stirred for 30 minutes. Potassium hydroxide (15 g.) is then added, and stirring is continued until the pellets are completely dissolved. The reaction mixture is filtered with suction, and the volume of the filtrate is reduced to approximately 50 ml. with a rotary evaporator while the bath temperature is kept below 45\u00b0 (Note 4) and (Note 5). To this concentrate is added 10 ml. of water and 25 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The organic layer previously separated and the ethereal extracts are combined and extracted with three 20-ml. portions of 6 M hydrochloric acid (Note 6). The combined acid layers are saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four 30-ml. portions of ether (Note 7). The aqueous solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice bath and brought to pH > 12 by addition of potassium hydroxide pellets to the stirred solution (Note 8) and (Note 9). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 40-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with 10 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and freed of ether with a rotary evaporator (Note 4). This crude product is fractionated through a 15-cm. Vigreux column (Note 10). After 1\u20133 g. of a forerun, b.p. 144\u2013155\u00b0 (Note 11) is separated, the fraction boiling at 156\u2013159\u00b0 is collected, yielding 13.3\u201313.7 g.

            "A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer (Note 1), a thermometer, and a vent (Note 2) is placed in a water bath and charged with 600 ml. of 98% sulfuric acid (Note 3). Powdered adamantane [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 16 (1973)], (100 g., 0.735 mole), is added in one portion to the stirred acid, and the mixture is heated rapidly (with the water bath) to an internal temperature of 70\u00b0. The internal temperature is then raised gradually to 80\u00b0 over a 2-hour period (Note 4) while vigorous stirring is maintained (Note 5). After stirring at 80\u00b0 is continued for an additional 2 hours, the temperature is raised to 82\u00b0. When almost all the adamantane is dissolved, the residual sublimed material is scraped and rinsed from the walls of the flask (Note 1) and (Note 6). When GC analysis indicates that 2\u20133% of adamantanol is present (Note 6), the hot reaction mixture is poured immediately onto 800 g. of crushed ice, giving a 1500-ml. suspension containing crude adamantanone.\nA 750-ml. portion of this suspension of crude adamantanone is transferred to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask, equipped for steam distillation (Note 7) and (Note 8), which is placed in a heating mantle. The contents of the distillation flask are heated to 70\u00b0; the external heating is turned off (Note 9) and steam is introduced carefully through both inlet tubes (Note 10). The two layers of distillate are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of dichloromethane. This steam distillation procedure is then repeated with the second half of the suspension of crude adamantanone. The organic extracts are combined, washed with 100 ml. of aqueous, saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding 52\u201353 g.. (47\u201348%) of adamantanone (Note 11), (Note 12), and (Note 13)."

(5.00 moles) of ethyl acrylate (Note 1) is refluxed for 2 hours in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask. Subsequent vacuum removal of the excess ethyl acrylate at steam temperature yields 548 g.. (99%) of crude diethyl 3-N-(3-hydroxypropyl)iminodipropionate.

By cooling with an ice bath and controlling the addition rate, the reaction temperature is maintained below 40\u00b0 (Note 2). After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and poured slowly into a slurry of 340 g. of sodium hydrogen carbonate in 1 l. of water (Note 3). The organic layer is separated (Note 4) and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, below 50\u00b0, yielding 570 g.

A mixture of 100 g. of this crude material, 200 g. of anhydrous, powdered sodium carbonate (Note 5), and 10.0 g. of pentaerythritol (Note 6) in 200 ml. of diethyl phthalate is placed in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum-distillation head and an effective stirrer. The system is evacuated through a trap of sufficient capacity to contain 50 ml. of liquid, and the product is distilled by heating the stirred suspension with a heating mantle at 10\u201315 mm. By proper adjustment of the heat source, the distillation temperature is maintained below 150\u00b0, minimizing codistillation of diethyl phthalate. The distillate is collected until the head temperature cannot be kept below 150\u00b0. Redistillation of the resulting crude product through a 4-in. Vigreux column yields 34.0 g.

Vigreux column fitted with a vacuum-distillation head. The flask is removed from the heat source, and 50 g. (0.32 mole) of purified ethyl 3-(1-azetidinyl)propionate is added dropwise at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 150\u00b0 (Note 9).

            "A. tert-Butylmalononitrile. A dry, 2-l., three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, and a Claisen adapter fitted with a dropping funnel and condenser protected with a drying tube is charged with 200 ml. of nitromethane (Note 1). The flask is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice\u2013salt bath (Note 2), and anhydrous powdered aluminum chloride (90.0 g., 0.674 mole) is added, with slow stirring, through a powder funnel that temporarily replaces the thermometer. The temperature may rise to ca. 50\u00b0 but quickly drops to 0\u00b0. A solution of 45.0 g. (0.682 mole) of malononitrile (Note 3) in 50 ml. of nitromethane is added through the dropping funnel at a rate such that the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0 (approximately one hour). This is followed by slow, dropwise addition of a solution of 150 g. (1.62 moles) of tert-butyl chloride in 50 ml. of nitromethane at a rate such that the temperature is maintained below 10\u00b0 (approximately 3\u20134 hours). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u20135\u00b0 for 10 hours before 1 l. of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (ca. 80 g. in 1000 ml. of water) is added slowly and cautiously (still in the cold), keeping the temperature below 10\u00b0. The mixture is poured into a 3 or 4 l. beaker and solid sodium hydrogen carbonate (ca. 100 g.) is added in small portions, with stirring. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous layer extracted with three half-volume portions of dichloromethane, which are concentrated on a rotary evaporator, combined with the organic phase, and concentrated further. The resultant brown oil is subjected to steam distillation. The first fraction is collected using a cold water condenser until solidification is observed in the condenser, at which time warm water is passed through the condenser and the receiver is changed (Note 5). The product is collected until occasional passage of cold water through the condenser no longer causes apparent solidification. At this point, the receiver is changed again, and a third fraction (ca. 500 ml.) is collected. The middle fraction is cooled in ice and filtered with vacuum through a medium fritted glass funnel, yielding 48\u201350 g. of light-yellow product. Extraction of the filtrate with two half-volumes of diethyl ether followed by evaporation gives an additional small amount (ca. 2 g.) of product. Another small crop of product may be gleaned from the first and third steam distillation fractions by separating any organic phase, removing distillable material on a rotary evaporator, cooling, and filtering the resulting solid. The total combined yield of crude product is 54\u201358 g. (65\u201370%). Further purification is accomplished by careful sublimation at 80\u201390 mm. (ca. 85\u00b0), giving 52\u201356.5 g. (63\u201368%) of white, waxy dinitrile, m.p. 76\u201379\u00b0 with softening at 71\u00b0.",

A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet, dropping funnel, and condenser attached to an acetone gas trap (Note 6) is flushed with dry nitrogen for 30 minutes and charged with purified tert-butylmalononitrile (30.5 g., 0.250 mole), sodium borohydride (17.5 g., 98% assay, 0.453 mole), and 150 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 1) A dry nitrogen atmosphere is maintained while boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (85.3 g., 0.600 mole) (Note 7) in 50 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise, with slow magnetic stirring, at a rate that permits gentle reflux. The addition takes about 4 hours (Note 8). The mixture is stirred for an additional 90 minutes, hydrolyzed by the very cautious dropwise addition of 30 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and transferred to a 1-l. flask, with rinsing by 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The solution is evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, yielding a dry, white, solid mass, to which is added a small portion (ca. 10 ml.) of 125 ml. of aqueous 40% (w/w) sodium hydroxide. The mixture is triturated with a glass rod and warmed on a steam bath until a reaction begins; heat is generated, and white smoke is evolved. The reaction is controlled by cooling in an ice bath. When the reaction appears to have subsided at room temperature, the trituration is repeated cautiously until all 125 ml. of the hydroxide solution is added. The resulting mixture is warmed for 30 minutes on a steam bath, with occasional stirring, cooled, and filtered with vacuum. The solid material is washed with ten 20-ml. portion of ether. The filtrate is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts and organic phase are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is filtered and washed with ether, and the filtrate concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is fractionally distilled at reduced pressure through a short Vigreux column. After removal of residual solvent and collection of a small forerun, 11.5\u201315.5 g. (36\u201348%) of product is obtained, b.p. 92.5\u201395\u00b0 (21 mm.), 96\u201398\u00b0 (27 mm.), nD28 1.4570\u20131.4585. Analysis of the product by GC (OV-1 column) indicated the purity to be ca. 95% (Note 9)."

To the stirred suspension are added simultaneously, over 5 minutes, 115 g. (1.00 mole) of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (Note 4) and 214 g. (1.10 moles) of tert-butyl phenyl carbonate (Note 5). The proline dissolves completely within a few minutes in an exothermic reaction, the temperature of which reaches a maximum of 50\u201352\u00b0 after 10\u201315 minutes. After stirring for 3 hours, the clear reaction mixture is transferred to a 6-l. separatory funnel and shaken with 2.2 l. of water and 1.8 l. of diethyl ether (Note 6). The aqueous layer, after being washed with 500 ml. of ether, is acidified to pH 3.0 by the addition of 10% sulfuric acid (Note 7), which generally causes partial crystallization of the product. The acidic solution, including the solid, is extracted with three 600-ml. portions of a mixture of equal volumes of ethyl acetate and ether. The combined extracts are washed with three 25-ml. portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated with a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature not exceeding 40\u00b0. After drying in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0, the crude product weighs 202 g., m.p. 129\u2013132\u00b0.

            "A. Binor-S.2 A 2-l., three-necked flask equipped with Teflon sleeves (Note 1), a thermometer, a condenser, a dropping funnel, and a mechanical stirrer is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 200 g. (2.18 moles) of freshly distilled norbornadiene (Note 2), 400 ml. of dry toluene, and 7.8 g. of cobalt bromide\u2013triphenylphosphine catalyst (Note 3). While stirring at room temperature, 2.1 ml. of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate co-catalyst (Note 4) is added dropwise. The mixture is heated slowly to 105\u00b0, and the heating mantle is lowered. The ensuing exothermic reaction maintains the temperature at 105\u2013110\u00b0 for 15 minutes. When the temperature begins to fall, the mantle is raised, the mixture is brought to the reflux temperature, and stirring and refluxing are continued for 12 hours. The cooled mixture is diluted with 650 ml. of dichloromethane, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with three 650-ml. portions of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvents are evaporated at reduced pressure. The residual crude material, 185\u2013203 g., is distilled at 106\u2013107\u00b0 (1.5 mm.), giving 165\u2013170 g. (82\u201385%) of Binor-S, which solidifies on cooling to a white solid, m.p. 59\u201363\u00b0.",
            "B. Tetrahydro-Binor-S. Binor-S (135.0 g., 0.734 mole) is dissolved in 670 ml. of glacial acetic acid containing 5.7 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. To this solution is added 1.0 g. of platinum oxide catalyst. The reaction mixture is hydrogenated at 200 p.s.i. hydrogen pressure and 70\u00b0 for 3 hours, using a 1200-ml., glass-lined autoclave (Note 5). After cooling to room temperature, the catalyst is removed with suction filtration, and water (ca. 1.5 l.) is added to the filtrate until two layers form. The bottom layer, containing only tetrahydro-Binor-S, is removed, and the top layer, consisting of a mixture of acetic acid and water, is extracted with one 400 ml. and two 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane\u2013tetrahydro-Binor-S layers are washed twice with 100 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual tetrahydro-Binor-S is purified by distillation under reduced pressure, b.p. 105\u2013110\u00b0 (1.5 mm.), giving 125\u2013130 g. (90\u201394%) of colorless liquid (Note 6).",

(0.11 mole) of fresh aluminum bromide and 100 ml. of cyclohexane (Note 7). The apparatus is flushed with hydrogen bromide gas (Note 8). When the aluminum bromide has dissolved, 100 g. (0.532 mole) of hydrogenated Binor-S is added dropwise to the rapidly stirred solution, and the reaction mixture refluxes for a short time without external heat. The course of the reaction is monitored by GC until no starting material remains (Note 9). Occasionally, an additional 5 g. portion of aluminum bromide, and application of external heat are needed to complete the reaction. The total reaction time is about 2\u20133 hours (Note 10). The hot cyclohexane layer is carefully decanted, and the aluminum bromide layer is extracted with five 200-ml. portions of hot cyclohexane. Diethyl ether (400 ml.) is added to the cooled cyclohexane extracts (Note 11), and the combined solvent fractions are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent leaves a semi-solid residue, which is partially dissolved in about 100 ml. of pentane. The undissolved white solid, diamantane, is collected by suction filtration. Additional diamantane is obtained by concentrating the pentane solution to a small volume and collecting the solid that precipitates. The total amount of diamantane obtained, after drying, is 60\u201362 g. (60\u201362%), m.p. 240\u2013241\u00b0 (closed tube) (Note 12). This product is sufficiently pure for most purposes, but it may be purified further by recrystallization from pentane, giving white crystals, m.p. 244.0\u2013245.4\u00b0."

            "A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a nitrogen inlet, and a Y-tube fitted with a low temperature thermometer and a nitrogen outlet. The outlet is vented through a bubbler tube, maintaining a slight positive pressure. The flask and dropping funnel are flamed in a stream of dry nitrogen (Note 1). To the flask is added 115.0 g. (0.4989 mole) of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (Note 2) followed by 500 ml. of dry diglyme (Note 3). The solution is stirred vigorously, and the flask is immersed in a cooling bath at \u221278\u00b0 (Note 4). A diglyme solution of lithium aluminum tri-tert-butoxyhydride (Note 5) is prepared in the following manner. Dry diglyme (450 ml.) is added with vigorous stirring to an Erlenmeyer flask containing 140.0 g. (0.5512 mole) of lithium aluminum tri-tert-butoxyhydride. After standing overnight, the resulting suspension is filtered under a blanket of dry nitrogen through a thick layer of Celite packed tightly on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 6). The flask containing the filtrate is kept stoppered until the reducing agent is transferred to the dropping funnel. Dropwise addition of this solution is started when the contents of the reaction flask reach \u221272\u00b0. There is a color change and a temperature rise of a few degrees. The rate of addition is adjusted, maintaining the temperature of the mixture between \u221278\u00b0 and \u221268\u00b0 (Note 7). After addition is complete the mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0 for 30 minutes longer.\nThe cold reaction mixture is poured slowly with stirring into a 3-l. beaker containing 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 300 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and 150 g. of ice. A white precipitate starts to separate (Note 8). An additional 150 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added to the beaker and, after a minute, an upper layer begins to appear. The contents are transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 15 to 30 minutes while an upper brown layer separates. The upper layer is reserved while the lower layer is extracted with several portions of benzene, totalling 900 ml. The upper layer and the benzene extracts are combined and washed with seven 1-l. portions of water containing 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene layer is washed successively with 100-ml. portions of aqueous 2% sodium hydrogen carbonate until the washings are basic, dried over 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, treated with 1 g. of charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure, yielding 59\u201362 g. (60\u201363%) of crude 3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde, as a tan solid, m.p. 76\u201380\u00b0. Trituration in an ice bath with cold dry diethyl ether (ca. 0.3 ml./g.) gives a spongy solid, m.p. 85\u201387\u00b0 (lit.3 85\u00b0), with losses of 5\u201310%, sufficiently pure for most uses.

The reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen, and a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained within the apparatus for the remainder of the reaction sequence. A solution of 8.8 g. (0.076 mole of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (Note 3) in 40 ml. of anhydrous hexane is added to the dropping funnel, followed by a hexane solution containing 0.076 mole of n-butyllithium (Note 4). The resulting solution, which becomes warm as the organolithium-diamine complex forms, is allowed to stand for 15 minutes, then added to the reaction mixture, dropwise and with stirring over 15\u201320 minutes. The resulting bright yellow, turbid reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 hours longer before a solution of 13.8 g. (0.0758 mole) of benzophenone (Note 5) in 40 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added to the reaction mixture, dropwise and with stirring over 20 minutes. The resulting, deep-green solution is stirred for an additional 20 minutes, then poured into a vigorously stirred solution of 12 g. (0.20 mole) of acetic acid in 30 ml. of ether (Note 6). After the reaction solution has been successively extracted with 50 ml. of water and four 50-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, the aqueous extracts are combined (Note 7) and made basic with aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide. The alkaline mixture is heated to boiling and maintained at this temperature until the escaping vapor is no longer basic to moistened pHydrion paper (Note 8). The mixture is then cooled, and the white solid product which separates is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with three 20-ml. portions of water. The crude product (m.p. 142\u2013168\u00b0) is recrystallized from 250 ml. of 3 : 1 (v/v) hexane-ethyl acetate, giving 6.6\u20138.2 g. of the amino alcohol product as colorless prisms, m.p. 168\u2013171\u00b0. Concentration of the mother liquors gives an additional 0.8\u20131.2 g. of product, m.p. 167\u2013169\u00b0, for a total yield of 7.8\u20139.0 g. (49\u201357%).

A dry, three-necked, 1-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet tube, and a 125-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped with a rubber septum is charged with 15.7 g. (0.646 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings. The flask is dried by heating with a flame while a stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the reaction vessel from the condenser and allowed to exit from a hypodermic needle inserted in the rubber septum. After drying, the hypodermic needle is removed and the flask is allowed to cool; a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel for the remainder of the reaction. A small crystal of iodine and 450 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether are added (Note 1). A solution of 49.4 g. (0.546 mole) of 4-chloro-1-butene (Note 2) in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether is then added from the dropping funnel, dropwise and with stirring. Sufficient external heat is applied to the reaction flask to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture at about 30\u00b0. After approximately 10\u201350% of the chloride solution has been added, a spontaneous reaction ensues as evidenced by the disappearance of the yellow iodine color, the appearance of a gray color in the reaction solution, and the commencement of gentle refluxing. The external heat is removed, and the remainder of the chloride solution is added at a rate that maintains gentle refluxing. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes before a solution of 40.1 g. (0.572 mole) of methacrolein (Note 3) in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, dropwise with stirring and refluxing, over 45 minutes. Since the reaction with methacrolein is exothermic, the application of external heat may not be necessary to maintain refluxing during this addition. During the addition the reaction mixture usually becomes cloudy. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for 1.5 hours before it is cooled in an ice water bath and 250 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid is added slowly and with stirring (Note 4). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with four 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic solutions are washed successively with 200 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and 200 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The resulting ether solution is concentrated, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 37.2\u201347.3 g.

            "A. Hexadehydro[18]annulene. A 12-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with a stopcock at the bottom (Figure 1) (Note 1) is fitted with a stirrer (Note 2), a reflux condenser, and a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is placed in a large metal vessel equipped with a hot\u2013cold water inlet and a drain. The flask is charged with 600 g. (3.00 moles) of copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Note 3) and 3.8 l. of pyridine (Note 4). Stirring is begun and warm water is added to the metal vessel to heat the contents of the flask to 55 \u00b1 1\u00b0, and the mixture is slowly stirred at this temperature for 1 hour. With vigorous stirring (approximately 600 r.p.m., (Note 4)), a solution of 50 g. (0.64 mole) of 1,5-hexadiyne (Note 5) in 400 ml. of pyridine (Note 6) is added over 30 minutes to the 55\u00b0, green suspension. The mixture is stirred vigorously at this temperature for an additional 2 hours before the warm water in the metal vessel is allowed to drain and is replaced with a mixture of ice and water. When the contents of the flask have cooled, the mixture is drawn off through the stopcock at the bottom of the flask and filtered through a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel (Filtrate A). The green residue is transferred to a 5-l. beaker and 2.5 l. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene\u2013diethyl ether is added. The mixture is stirred well, avoiding emulsion formation, and filtered (Filtrate B). The residue is similarly extracted with 2.5 l. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene\u2013ether and filtered (Filtrate C). Each filtrate is kept separate.\nFigure 1.\nFiltrate A is concentrated to approximately 200 ml. (Note 7) and added to Filtrate C. The resulting mixture is well agitated and filtered through a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The residue is extracted twice in a similar manner with 500 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene\u2013ether. All the filtrates are now combined in the original 12-l. reaction vessel (Note 8) and washed successively with two 500-ml. portions of water, two 500-ml. portions of cold (0\u00b0), 2 N hydrochloric acid, and three 500 ml portions of water. The organic layer is dried for 2 hours over ca. 110 g. of magnesium sulfate (Note 9), filtered, and evaporated to dryness (Note 7), yielding approximately 16 g. of crude product.",
            "B. Tridehydro[18]annulene. The dark brown residue from Part A and 800 ml. of benzene (Note 10) are added to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a calcium chloride drying tube. The solid dissolves on heating to reflux, then the solution is allowed to cool briefly. The condenser is removed, and 800 ml. of a saturated solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol (Note 11) and (Note 12) is rapidly added (Note 13). After the resulting solution is heated to reflux for 30 minutes, the hot mixture is transferred to the original 12-l. reaction vessel (Note 14), which contains approximately 2 l. of ice, and 1.5 l. of ether is added. The resulting mixture is stirred well then allowed to stand for a few minutes. The incompletely separated phases, in which is suspended a large amount of black solid, are filtered through a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. Whenever the filtration becomes slow, the black material on the filter paper is washed with ether, and the paper is replaced. The organic layer of the filtrate is separated, washed three times with 500-ml. portions of water, dried for 2 hours over ca. 100 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 9), filtered, and evaporated to dryness (Note 7) and (Note 15). The red-brown viscous residue is dissolved in 60 ml. of benzene (Note 10) and chromatographed on alumina.\nOne liter of 95:5 (v/v) pentane\u2013ether (Note 16) is poured into a closed chromatography column (100 \u00d7 4.5 cm.), the bottom of which is protected by a small plug of cotton wool. One kilogram of alumina (Note 17) is added in portions, with slow rotation by hand. The stopcock is opened, and the level of the supernatant liquid is allowed to fall to the top of the alumina. The benzene solution is now added with a long pipette and is allowed to seep in. The column is developed first with 1 l. of 95:5 (v/v) pentane\u2013ether in order to wash out the benzene, then with 80:20 (v/v) pentane\u2013ether. Two bands are observable on the column. The faster moving, light brown band consists of tridehydro[18]annulene (Note 18) and the slower moving, dark brown band consists of tetradehydro[24]annulene. When the first band is approximately 15 cm. from the bottom of the column, after approximately 4\u20136 l. of solvent have been eluted, 150-ml. fractions are collected, and the electronic spectrum of each fraction is determined. As soon as the maxima at 385 and 400 mm. characteristic of tridehydro[18]annulene appear (Note 19), the fractions are combined (\"mixed fractions\") until the first band is approximately 1 cm. from the bottom of the column. Essentially \"pure\" tridehydro[18]annulene (Note 18) is now eluted, and this material is collected until the second band is approximately 5 cm. from the bottom of the column. Smaller fractions (150 ml. each) are now collected again; the electronic spectrum of each fraction is determined, and those still showing maxima at 385 and 400 nm. are combined with the previously mentioned \"mixed fractions.\" If required, the tetradehydro[24]annulene suitable for conversion to [24]annulene2 can then be eluted with pentane\u2013ether (70:30 to 50:50).\nThe electronic spectrum of the fractions containing the \"pure\" tridehydro[18]annulene exhibits the strongest absorption maximum (in benzene) at 342 nm. (\u03b5 155,000)3 and the spectroscopic yield, based on the molar extinction coefficient, is 1.17 g. (2.40% from 1,5-hexadiyne). The yield of tridehydro[18]annulene in the \"mixed fractions,\" based on the 342 nm. maximum, is 0.27 g. (0.55%). The tridehydro[18]annulene is best stored in solution in the refrigerator.",
            "C. [18]Annulene. In a 300-ml., conical flask fitted with a side arm (with a closed stopcock) and a 3.5-cm. Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar is placed 1 g. of a 10% palladium-on-calcium carbonate catalyst (Note 20) and 30 ml. of benzene (Note 10). The flask is attached to an atmospheric pressure hydrogenation apparatus, and the air in the system is replaced by hydrogen by evacuating the flask and refilling with hydrogen three times. The catalyst suspension is stirred until no more gas is absorbed. One-third (390 mg., determined spectroscopically) of the \"pure\" tridehydro[18]annulene solution described in Part B is evaporated to dryness (Note 7), and the resulting brown crystalline residue is dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene (Note 10). This solution is added to the hydrogenation flask through the side arm without stirring. The mixture is now stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere as rapidly as possible (ca. 600 r.p.m.) (Note 21) until 207 ml. (4.9 molar equivalents) of gas (22\u00b0, 740 mm.) are absorbed over ca. 5 minutes. The mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel, and the catalyst is washed with three 20-ml. portions of benzene.\nThis hydrogenation experiment is repeated twice with the remaining two-thirds of the \"pure\" tridehydro[18]annulene solution, and the combined filtrates from the three hydrogenations are evaporated to approximately 30 ml. (Note 7). The solution is then transferred with a pipette to a test tube (10 \u00d7 3 cm.) and concentrated to approximately 15 ml. at 40\u00b0 with a stream of nitrogen. The dark green solution is diluted with 20 ml. of ether and cooled in an ice bath for 30 minutes. The resulting red-brown crystals of [18]annulene are collected by filtration on a sintered glass funnel and washed with approximately 3 ml. of cold (\u221220\u00b0) ether. After drying in air for a few minutes this material weighs 114 mg. A second crop weighing 42 mg. is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquors to dryness (Note 7), followed by crystallization from 6 ml. of benzene and 20 ml. of ether. Both crops give a single spot on TLC (Note 22).\nThe [18]annulene mother liquors contain 181 mg. of unchanged tridehydro[18]annulene, as determined by the electronic spectrum (see Part B). They are combined with the \"mixed fractions\" described in Part B (containing 270 mg. of tridehydro[18]annulene), and the resulting solution is evaporated to dryness (Note 7). The residue is dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene and stirred with hydrogen and 1.0 g. of a 10% palladium-on-calcium carbonate catalyst (Note 20), as before, until 216 ml. (4.4 molar equivalents) of hydrogen (20\u00b0, 740 mm.) are absorbed. The catalyst is removed, and the filtrate is concentrated to approximately 6 ml., as described previously. After the addition of 20 ml. of ether and cooling in an ice bath, 112 mg. of [18]annulene is collected by filtration (Note 23). The purity of the product is confirmed by TLC (Note 22). The total yield of [18]annulene is 268 mg. (0.54% overall from 1,5-hexadiyne, (Note 24).\n[18]Annulene is best stored in benzene\u2013ether solution in the refrigerator. The crystals can also be kept for some time in the refrigerator, small crystals being less stable than large ones.2 Material that has decomposed to some extent may be purified as follows. The substance (300 mg.) is broken up with a spatula and heated with 30 ml. of benzene, and the insoluble material is removed by filtration. The filtrate is poured onto a chromatography column (20 \u00d7 1.8 cm.), prepared with 35 g. of alumina (Note 17) and benzene. The column is washed with benzene until the eluate is colorless. Polymeric material is retained at the top of the column. The eluent is concentrated to approximately 6 ml., diluted with 20 ml. of ether, and cooled in an ice\u2013salt bath. The resulting crystals of [18]annulene are collected on a sintered glass funnel, washed with 3 ml. of cold (\u221220\u00b0) ether, and dried in air for a few minutes."

Ammonia (3 l.) is condensed (Note 4) into the flask. The gas delivery-tube is removed, and 192.3 g. (8.361 g.-atoms) of sodium is added in small portions (Note 5), with vigorous stirring, over a period of 1 hour. The flask is then fitted with a dropping funnel, through which a solution of 192.3 g. (1.502 mole) of naphthalene in a mixture of 750 ml. of diethyl ether and 600 ml. of ethanol is added dropwise to the blue solution over 3 hours. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0 (Note 6) for another 6 hours. The cooling bath is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate overnight. The remaining white, solid residue is processed, with ice cooling and stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere, by slow addition of 120 ml. of methanol to destroy unreacted sodium, then 4\u20135 l. of ice water to dissolve the salts (Note 7). The reaction mixture is extracted with 1 l. of ether. Evaporation of the ether phase at room temperature under reduced pressure gives a coarse, white solid which is collected on a sintered-glass funnel and washed with water. Recrystallization from methanol (about 1.6 l.) using a heated funnel followed by drying of the crystals under reduced pressure (Note 8) gives 148\u2013158 g.

A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a tube-sealed stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and Claisen-adapter bearing an inlet tube for argon and a low temperature thermometer is charged with a solution of 132.2 g. (1.000 mole) of 1,4,5,8-tetrahydronaphthalene (isotetralin) in 1.3 l. of anhydrous ether (Note 10). To this solution is added 150 g. (1.33 mole) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 11) under an argon atmosphere, and the resulting suspension is cooled to \u221230\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath and stirred efficiently. While these conditions are maintained, a solution of 119.5 g. (1.000 mole) of chloroform in 150 ml. of ether is added dropwise over 90 minutes (Note 12). The mixture is stirred for another 30 minutes at \u221230\u00b0 before the temperature is allowed to rise above 0\u00b0. Following this, 300\u2013350 ml. of ice water is added to dissolve the salts; the two layers formed are separated (Note 13). The organic layer is washed with two 300-ml. portions of water, while the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid (or solid) is distilled under reduced pressure.\nThe distillation is expediently carried out using a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, an electrically heated 1.5 \u00d7 30 cm. column packed with V4A wire spirals (4 mm.) (Note 14), a short, air-cooled condenser (Note 15), and an ice-cooled, three-necked, 250-ml. receiver flask. During the distillation, the liquid is stirred magnetically and heated with an oil bath. The first fraction, b.p. 55\u201358\u00b0 (1 mm.), yields ca. 50 g. of isotetralin (Note 16), more of which is collected when the column is heated to about 100\u00b0. The temperature in the head of the column thereby rises to 90\u201395\u00b0, and it is necessary to change the receiver flask. The second fraction, collected at 95\u2013102\u00b0 (1 mm.), yields ca. 108 g. of 1:1-adducts, which consists of 92% of the desired tricyclo product and 8% of the side-addition product. The residue mainly contains the 2:1-adducts. The fraction containing the 1:1-adducts is recrystallized from methanol (about 500 ml.), giving 87\u201397 g.

The gas delivery tube is removed, and with vigorous stirring 56 g. (2.4 g.-atoms) of sodium is added in small portions with vigorous stirring over a period of 30 minutes (Note 18). The flask is then fitted with a dropping funnel, through which a solution of 81.4 g. (0.378 mole) of 11,11-dichlorotricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]-undeca-3,8-diene in 500 ml. of anhydrous ether is added over 1 hour, while cooling and stirring are maintained. After addition is complete, the acetone\u2013dry ice bath is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate overnight. The flask is placed in the acetone\u2013dry ice bath again, and a gentle stream of argon is passed continuously through the system. With stirring, a mixture of 90 ml. of methanol and 90 ml. of ether is added dropwise. The bath temperature is then allowed to rise to 0\u00b0 and, with continued stirring, 500 ml. of ice water is added slowly. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 2\u2013l. separatory funnel, and the two layers are separated. The organic layer is washed with 200 ml. of water, the aqueous layer is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of pentane (Note 19), and the combined ether\u2013pentane phases are dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration of the drying agent (Note 20) the solvent is removed by distillation through a 30-cm. Vigreux column.

A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a tube-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride drying tube, and an inlet tube for argon is charged with 900 ml. of anhydrous dioxane (Note 23). To this solvent is added, with stirring, 149 g. (0.656 mole) of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) (Note 24). When the DDQ has dissolved, 43.8 g. (0.300 mole) of tricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undeca-3,8-diene and 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid are added. The system is then flushed with argon, and the stirred mixture is heated under reflux for 5 hours. The reaction starts within a few minutes, as evidenced by effervescing of the solution and massive precipitation of the hydroquinone. At the same time the originally red-brown color of the mixture turns almost black. Following the reflux period, the bulk of the dioxane (600\u2013650 ml.) is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column while stirring is maintained. The resulting pasty mixture is cooled, and 150 ml. of n-hexane is added. The solid is suction filtered, washed with 500 ml. of warm n-hexane, and dried at 100\u00b0, giving ca. 144 g. (95%) of pure 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanohydroquinone (Note 25). The filtrate and washings are combined and passed through a 5 \u00d7 30 cm. column of neutral alumina (Note 26), which is eluted with n-hexane (Note 27). The solvent is removed by distillation through a 30-cm.

(1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of methanol is placed in a 1-l., four-necked flask equipped with a dry ice reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a gas-inlet, and an ice bath. While the solution is stirred and cooled, 50 g. (56 ml., 1.0 mole) of methanethiol (Note 1) is distilled from a lecture bottle into the solution at such a rate that the temperature is maintained below 20\u00b0. The gas-inlet is then replaced with a 60-ml., glass-stoppered, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and, while the reaction mixture is stirred and cooled, 44.4 g. (37.6 ml., 0.480 mole) of epichlorohydrin (Note 2) is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature is maintained below 50\u00b0 (Note 3).\nThe reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0 for 1 hour, diluted with 500 ml. of water, and extracted with two 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined extract is washed with five 100-ml. portions of water and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 4), filtered, and evaporated at 50\u00b0 (30 mm.). The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure without a column (Note 5), and the fraction boiling at 110\u2013111\u00b0 (7 mm.) or 101\u2013102\u00b0 (4 mm.) affords 61.0\u201363.6 g.

(0.339 mole) of sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil (Note 8). The mineral oil is removed by washing the dispersion with five 100-ml. portions of hexane (Note 9), which is removed with a pipet after the sodium hydride has been allowed to settle (Note 10).\nWhen most of the hexane has been removed, 500 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 11) and (Note 12) is added. While the reaction mixture is stirred, 33.4 g. (0.220 mole) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-propanol is added dropwise over 15 minutes. After the evolution of hydrogen ceases, the stirred mixture is cooled with a water bath. When the mixture reaches 20\u00b0, 34.2 g.

(0.1153 mole) of diisopropylamine (Note 15) and 175 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 11). The flask is flushed with nitrogen, and a slight positive pressure is maintained with a slow stream of nitrogen during the following operation. The solution is magnetically stirred and cooled to about \u221275\u00b0 with an acetone-dry ice bath. After 15 minutes, 77.0 ml. (0.112 mole) of 1.45 M solution of n-butyllithium butyllithium in hexane (Note 16) is added dropwise, using the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. While the resulting solution of lithium diisopropylamide is stirred at \u221275\u00b0, 9.15 g. (0.0551 mole) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-methoxypropane is added through a dropping funnel. The acetone\u2013dry ice bath is replaced with an ice-water bath, and the solution is stirred at 0\u00b0 for 2.5 hours. The solution slowly becomes deep purple in color as 1,3-bis(methylthio)allyllithium is generated (Note 17).\nThe solution is stirred and cooled to \u221275\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath, and 2.90 g. (0.0500 mole) of propionaldehyde (Note 18) is added through a dropping funnel. The solution is stirred at \u221275\u00b0 for 5 minutes. The acetone\u2013dry ice bath is replaced with a water bath, and the solution is stirred at 20\u00b0 for 30 minutes.

(0.0603 mole) of mercury (II) chloride in 140 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and 40 ml. of water is added. The mixture is stirred and heated at 50\u201355\u00b0 with a water bath for 15 hours. The reaction mixture is filtered (Note 21) with suction through a pad of diatomaceous earth in a sintered-glass funnel (Note 22). The filter cake is washed with a mixture of 200 ml. of pentane and 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The combined filtrate is washed with three 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted with a mixture of 100 ml. of pentane and 100 ml. of dichloromethane. The combined organic solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 4), filtered, and evaporated at 25\u00b0 (25 mm.). When almost all the solvent is removed, the residue is slurried with a mixture of 4 ml. of chloroform and 1 ml. of ether as soon as possible. Purification of the product is effected by chromatography on a 3 \u00d7 20 cm. column of 50 g. of silicic acid (Note 23) by elution with 4:1 chloroform\u2013ether. Each fraction (50 ml.) is monitored by TLC, and the fractions containing trans-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal uncontaminated with any by-product are collected.

        "Procedure": [
            "A. Potassium thiotosylate. A solution of 64.9 g. (1.00 mole) of 86.5% potassium hydroxide (Note 1) in 28 ml. of water is cooled in an ice bath, saturated with hydrogen sulfide, and flushed with nitrogen to ensure complete removal of excess hydrogen sulfide (Note 2) and (Note 3). The freshly prepared potassium hydrosulfide solution is diluted with 117 ml. of water and stirred under nitrogen at 55\u201360\u00b0 before 95.3 g. (0.500 mole) of finely ground p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 3) is introduced in small portions at a uniform rate so that the reaction temperature is maintained at 55\u201360\u00b0 (Note 2). A mildly exothermic reaction ensues, and the solution becomes intensely yellow. After about 90 g. of the tosyl chloride has been introduced, the yellow color disappears, and the dissolution of the chloride ceases. The reaction mixture is rapidly filtered with suction through a warmed funnel, and the filtrate is cooled several hours at 0\u20135\u00b0. The crystals of potassium thiotosylate are filtered, dissolved in 200 ml. of hot 80% ethanol, filtered hot to remove traces of sulfur, and cooled several hours at 0\u20135\u00b0. The recrystallized salt is filtered and air-dried, providing 48\u201355 g. (42\u201349%) of white crystals.",
            "B. Trimethylene dithiotosylate. To 150 ml. of 95% ethanol containing 10\u201320 mg. of potassium iodide is added 40 g. (0.18 mole) of potassium thiotosylate and 20 g. (0.10 mole) of 1,3-dibromopropane (trimethylene dibromide) (Note 4). The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 8 hours in the dark and under nitrogen. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, diluted with an equal volume of cold water, and agitated. After decantation of the supernatant liquid, the residual honeylike layer of product is washed with three 200-ml. portions of cold water, once with 100 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and once with 100 ml. of cold absolute ethanol. The crude product (Note 5) is dissolved in 10 ml. of acetone, diluted with 80 ml. of hot absolute ethanol, and stirred under nitrogen at 0\u00b0. The oil which separates is redissolved by the addition of a minimum amount (ca. 5 ml.) of acetone. Seed crystals are introduced (Note 6), and the mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 0\u00b0 under nitrogen and stored at \u221230\u00b0 for several hours. The microcrystalline product is collected by filtration and weighs 20.2 g., m.p. 63.5\u201365.0\u00b0. Three recrystallizations from nine parts (180 ml.) of ethanol give 17.2 g. (41%) of white needles, m.p. 66\u201367\u00b0 (Note 7). During the recrystallizations some of the material oils out when the solution is cooled to room temperature. The supernatant liquid is decanted, seeded, and stored at \u221230\u00b0 for several hours. The oil is not further purified. The recrystallized material is chemically pure for further use [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 590 (1988)].",
            "C. Ethylene dithiotosylate. To 200 ml. of ethanol containing 10\u201320 mg. of potassium iodide is added 45.3 g. (0.200 mole) of potassium thiotosylate and 18.8 g. (0.100 mole) of 1,2-dibromopropane. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 8 hours in the dark and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent is removed, and the resulting white solid is washed with a mixture of 80 ml. of ethanol and 150 ml. of water. After decantation, the solid is washed three times with 50-ml. portions of water and recrystallized from approximately 150 ml. of ethanol, yielding 28.7 g. of crude product, m.p. 72\u201375\u00b0. Three recrystallizations from a mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol afford 24 g. (60%) of white crystals, m.p. 75\u201376\u00b0 (Note 8)."

Meanwhile, to a cooled solution of freshly prepared 2-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide (0.414 mole) (Note 4) is added 150 g. (146 ml., 0.828 mole) of dry hexamethylphosphoric triamide (Note 5). This solution is then transferred under an argon atmosphere to the 500-ml. dropping funnel with the aid of an argon-pressurized siphon. The solution is slowly run into the cooled suspension, whereupon the methiodide salt dissolves. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.\nThe suspension is slowly poured into 600 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution which has previously been cooled to 10\u201315\u00b0, and the mixture is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of diethyl ether.

Herschberg dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated through a mercury bubbler, flamed dry, and flushed with nitrogen three times. The system is left under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen, and all the reactants are added under a stream of nitrogen. A solution of 0.05 mole of ethylmagnesium bromide in 37 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) is placed in the flask. A solution of 6.35 g. (0.0567 mole) of N-(2-methylpropylidene)-tert-butylamine (Note 4) in 5 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (Note 5) is then added from the dropping funnel. The resulting mixture is refluxed for 12\u201314 hours until 1 mole-equivalent of gas has evolved (Note 6). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature; 6.30 g. (0.0498 mole) of benzyl chloride (Note 1) is added from the dropping funnel; and the solution is refluxed for 20 hours, at which time the pH is 9\u201310 (pHydrion paper). To the cooled solution, which contains a large amount of solid, is added 20\u201330 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid. The clear, yellow-brown solution is then refluxed for 2 hours, cooled, saturated with solid sodium chloride, and extracted five times with diethyl ether. The organic extracts are washed once with 25 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid, then repeatedly with brine until the washings are neutral. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure through a 12-in. Vigreux column fitted with a partial take-off head.

            "A. 2-Acetoxy-trans-1-phenylpropene. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a rubber septum, and the apparatus is arranged so that the flask may be cooled intermittently with an ice bath. After the reaction vessel has been flushed with nitrogen (admitted through a hypodermic needle in the rubber septum) a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel for the remainder of the reaction. The flask is charged with 35 g. of a 57% dispersion of sodium hydride (20 g., 0.83 mole) in mineral oil (Note 1). The mineral oil is washed from the hydride with 200 ml. of anhydrous pentane. The supernatant pentane layer is removed with a stainless-steel cannula inserted through the rubber septum (Note 2). The residual sodium hydride is mixed with 250 ml. of anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 3) before 65 g. (0.48 mole) of phenylacetone (Note 4) is added dropwise and with stirring over 50\u201360 minutes. During this addition an open hypodermic needle should be inserted in the rubber septum to permit the escape of hydrogen, and intermittent cooling with an ice bath may be necessary to keep the reaction solution from boiling. The resulting mixture is stirred for 3 hours while it is allowed to cool, then the mixture is allowed to stand for approximately 2 hours, permitting the excess sodium hydride to settle. The supernatant liquid is transferred under positive nitrogen pressure through a stainless-steel cannula (Note 2) into a 1-l., three-necked flask containing 108 g. (100 ml., 1.00 mole) of cold (0\u00b0), freshly distilled acetic anhydride (b.p. 140\u00b0) and fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, an ice bath, and a rubber septum into which are inserted a hypodermic needle to admit nitrogen and a cannula to transfer the enolate solution.\nThe enolate solution is added slowly with cooling and vigorous stirring so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below 30\u00b0. After all the supernatant enolate solution has been transferred, the residual slurry of sodium hydride is washed with an additional 50-ml. portion of anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 3); these washings are also added to the acetic anhydride solution. The resulting viscous mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes and poured cautiously into a mixture of 500 ml. of pentane, 500 ml. of water, and 130 g. (1.54 moles) of sodium hydrogen carbonate. When hydrolysis of the excess acetic anhydride and neutralization of the acetic acid are complete, the pentane layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 ml. of pentane. The combined pentane solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residual orange liquid through a 20\u201330-cm. Vigreux column (Note 5) provides 61.7\u201380.6 g. (73\u201395%) of 2-acetoxy-trans-1-phenylpropene, b.p. 82\u201389\u00b0 (1 mm.), nD25 1.5320\u20131.5327 (Note 6).",
            "B. threo-4-Hydroxy-3-phenyl-2-heptanone. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask is fitted with a Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar, a gas-inlet tube equipped with a stopcock, a low-temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum and mounted to permit the use of an external cooling bath. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. After 10\u201320 mg. of 2,2'-bipyridyl has been added to the reaction flask as an indicator, an ethereal solution containing 0.412 mole of halide-free methyllithium (Note 7) is added to the reaction flask with a hypodermic syringe or stainless-steel cannula inserted through the rubber septum. The diethyl ether is removed under reduced pressure (Note 8) while the flask is warmed to 40\u00b0 with a water bath, the reaction vessel is refilled with nitrogen, and 120 ml. of anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added (Note 3). The resulting purple solution is cooled to \u221210 to \u221220\u00b0 with a 2-propanol\u2013dry ice bath before 35.2 g. (0.200 mole) (Note 9) of 2-acetoxy-trans-1-phenylpropene is added from a hypodermic syringe dropwise and with stirring over 15 minutes while the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept in the range \u221220 to +10\u00b0. The resulting red-brown solution is stirred for an additional 10 minutes at \u221210 to 0\u00b0 before 285 ml. of an ethereal solution containing 0.202 mole of anhydrous zinc chloride (Note 10) is added to the cold (\u221210 to +10\u00b0) reaction mixture from a hypodermic syringe dropwise and with stirring over 10 minutes. The reddish-yellow cloudy reaction mixture (Note 11) is stirred at 0\u00b0 for 10 minutes before 14.50 g. (0.2014 mole) of freshly distilled butyraldehyde (Note 12) is added rapidly (30 seconds) and with stirring to the cold (\u22125 to +10\u00b0) reaction mixture. After the mixture has been stirred at 0\u20135\u00b0 for 4 minutes, it is poured with vigorous stirring into a cold (0\u20135\u00b0) mixture of 500 ml. of 4 M ammonium chloride and 200 ml. of ether. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic solutions are washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 1 M ammonium chloride and with two 50-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and the combined aqueous washings are extracted with an additional 100-ml. portion of ether. The combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure (water aspirator) with a rotary evaporator, removing the solvents and residual 1,2-dimethoxyethane. The residual liquid, which may crystallize on standing (Note 13), is triturated with 50 ml. of pentane, and the crystalline solid that separates is collected on a filter. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and again triturated with pentane, yielding an additional crop of the crude product. The combined crops of the crude threo-aldol product total 26.2\u201328.4 g. (64\u201369%), m.p. 57\u201362\u00b0. The crude product is recrystallized from 125\u2013150 ml. of hexane. After the solution has been cooled to 0\u00b0, 21.3\u201324.1 g. of the threo-aldol product is collected as white needles, m.p. 71.5\u201372.5\u00b0 (Note 14). The mother liquors are concentrated and cooled, separating additional fractions of the product (0.5\u20130.8 g.), m.p. 71\u201372\u00b0. The total yield of the threo-aldol product is 22.1\u201324.6 g. (53\u201360%)."

(0.022 mole) of sodium hydride is added to the stirred solution over a period of 10 minutes (Note 3). The resulting slurry is stirred for 5 hours at room temperature (Note 4) then cooled to 0\u00b0 (ice bath) before 2.53 g. (2.30 ml., 0.0200 mole) of benzyl chloride (Note 5) is added as rapidly as possible to the stirred mixture. The mixture is stirred for 8\u201315 hours (overnight), during which time the ice in the ice bath melts, and the temperature of the reaction flask gradually rises to room temperature. The mixture is then diluted with 15 ml. of water and extracted with three 25-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with two 40-ml. portions of water and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration the solvent is removed at reduced pressure, and 4.4 g. of crude 1-benzylindole is obtained as a liquid. After bulb-to-bulb distillation of this material in a K\u00fcgelrohr oven [120\u2013130\u00b0 (0.0025 mm.)], crystallization of the distillate from 15 ml. of hot ethanol affords 3.46\u20133.61 g.

The flask is fitted with a short-path distilling head and heated first with a stream of hot air from a heat gun and then with the flame from a small burner. The flask is heated until no more trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride distills, b.p. 82\u2013115\u00b0, yielding 28.4\u201331.2 g. (83\u201391%) of the anhydride, a colorless liquid. Although this product is sufficiently pure for use in the next step, the remaining acid may be removed from the anhydride by the following procedure. A slurry of 3.2 g. of phosphorus pentoxide in 31.2 g. of the crude anhydride is stirred at room temperature in a stoppered flask for 18 hours. After the reaction flask has been fitted with a short-path distilling head, it is heated with an oil bath, yielding 0.7 g. of forerun, b.p. 74\u201381\u00b0, followed by 27.9 g. of the pure trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride, b.p. 81\u201384\u00b0 (Note 3).",

(0.0352 mole) of anhydrous pyridine (Note 5) in 10 ml. of anhydrous n-pentane (Note 6) is placed in a dry, 50-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and the flask is stoppered with a rubber septum. After the solution has been cooled in an acetone\u2013dry ice cooling bath, 9.72 g. (5.80 ml., 0.0395 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added with a hypodermic syringe, dropwise and with swirling over 2\u20133 minutes. The resulting mixture, from which a white solid separates initially, is allowed to warm to room temperature over 22\u201324 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes red in color (Note 7), and a viscous, red semisolid separates. The supernatant pentane solution is decanted, and the residual viscous semisolid is washed with two 10-ml. portions of pentane. While the combined pentane solutions are stored over anhydrous potassium carbonate, the remaining red semisolid is dissolved in 5 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and extracted with three 5-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane solutions (including the solid potassium carbonate) are washed rapidly (Note 8) with 5 ml. of cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After the orange pentane solution has been concentrated to a volume of approximately 10 ml. with a rotary evaporator, it is transferred to a small distilling apparatus. The remaining pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure (Note 9). The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 2.94\u20132.97 g. (45%) of a colorless, liquid fraction containing 3-methyl-2-buten-2-yl triflate and a lesser amount of 3-methyl-1-buten-2-yl triflate, b.p. 58\u201366\u00b0 (22 mm.), n25D 1.3832\u20131.3898 (Note 10). Fractional distillation of this mixture with a 40-cm. spinning band column separated higher boiling fractions, b.p. 45\u201347\u00b0 (12 mm.), that contained (Note 10) 98% of the 3-methyl-2-buten-2-yl triflate as a colorless liquid, n25D 1.3838 (Note 11)."

The system is flushed with nitrogen through a gas-inlet tube attached to the top of the funnel. To 150 ml. of dry dichloromethane (Note 1) in the flask is added 75 g. (0.27 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Note 2), and the solution is cooled to \u221240\u00b0. After addition of 14.5 g. (0.175 mole) of finely powdered anhydrous sodium carbonate (Note 3), 15g. (0.21 mole) of 3-butyn-1-ol (Note 4) is added dropwise over a 20-minute period to the well-stirred reaction mixture maintained at \u221240\u00b0 to \u221255\u00b0. Stirring is continued at \u221230\u00b0 for 2 hours, at 0\u00b0 for another hour, and finally the reaction is quenched by dropwise addition of 50 ml. of water. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, the temperature of the water bath not exceeding 25\u00b0 The resulting residue is placed in a flask directly connected with a liquid nitrogen trap and distilled at 1 mm. The fractions boiling in the range from 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 are sufficiently pure for use in the next step. The yield of the sulfonate is 38.94 g. (90%) (Note 5) and (Note 6).",

(0.084 mole) of 3-butyn-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate, in this order. A magnetic stirring bar is added, and the ampoule is sealed. The stirred reaction mixture is immersed in a constant temperature bath kept at 65\u00b0 (\u00b12\u00b0) for 1 week. The ampoule is cooled slowly to \u221250\u00b0 with a methanol\u2013dry-ice bath (Note 8) and opened. With the aid of 200 ml. of diethyl ether the reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask to which 74 g. (1.83 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added carefully. During the addition the flask is immersed in the bath, maintained at approximately \u221250\u00b0 (Note 8). After the ethereal layer is separated, the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted twice with ether. The original organic layer and ethereal extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and directly distilled into a liquid nitrogen trap. The total condensate in the trap is placed in a distillation flask attached to a 40-cm. Vigreux column and a condenser cooled to \u221240\u00b0 with a circulating cold bath (Note 9). After the ether is distilled, all volatile materials are collected by raising the bath to 130\u00b0, yielding 1.84\u20132.05 g. (31\u201336%) of cyclobutanone.

            "A. Dineopentyl ketone. A dry, 2-l., three-necked flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a precision, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a mechanical stirrer. A gas-inlet tube at the top of the condenser is used to maintain a static nitrogen atmosphere in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. The flask is charged with 900 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, 45 g. (1.85 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings, and 74.6 g. (0.700 mole) of 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylpropane (Note 1). The vigorously stirred mixture is heated to gentle reflux before 156 g. (0.839 mole) of 1,2 dibromoethane in 150 ml. of dry ether is added over a 12-hour period (Note 2). After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for an additional 2 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 in an ice bath, and 71.7 g. (0.533 mole) of tert-butylacetyl chloride (Note 3) in 150 ml. of dry ether is added dropwise to the rapidly stirred Grignard reagent over a period of 1.5 hours (Note 4). The mixture is then stirred at 0\u20135\u00b0 for an additional 1.5 hours and poured with stirring onto a mixture of 800 g. of cracked ice and 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ether layer is separated and washed consecutively with 100 ml. each of water, 5% aqueous sodium carbonate solution, and finally saturated aqueous sodium chloride. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtration, and removal of solvent with a rotary evaporator, the yellow residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 81.2 g. (90%) of dineopentyl ketone as a colorless oil, b.p. 86\u201390\u00b0 (22 mm.) (Note 5) and (Note 6).",
            "B. \u03b1,\u03b1'-Dibromodineopentyl ketone. Caution! The dibromoketone, a highly volatile compound with lachrymatory properties, is a skin irritant which may induce allergic effects. Therefore, steps B and C should be performed in a well-ventilated hood. Rubber gloves should be worn. A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer, an addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a gas-exit tube, which is connected with Tygon tubing to a funnel inverted over a beaker of water for trapping hydrogen bromide, is charged with 82 g. (0.48 mole) of dineopentyl ketone in 500 ml. of dichloromethane, and the solution is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 in an ice bath. Over a period of 5 hours, 160 g. (1.00 mole) of bromine is added dropwise (Note 7), and the mixture is stirred an additional hour at 0\u20135\u00b0. The reaction mixture is carefully transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and the excess bromine is destroyed by extraction with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium sulfite (Note 8). After washing with 100 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, the organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated with a rotary evaporator. The yellow, crystalline residue is dissolved in 350 ml. of hot hexane and cooled in ice, giving the dibromoketone as white needles, which are collected by suction filtration, washed with 100 ml. of cold hexane (Note 9), and air dried in a well-ventilated hood, yielding 83 g. of product. Concentration of the mother liquors provides two additional crops of crystals (40 g. and 12 g.) for a total yield of 135 g. (85%) of dibromoketone, m.p. 69\u201372\u00b0 (Note 10).",
            "C. Di-tert-butylcyclopropenone. Caution! The same precautions described in Part B should be exercised in this step. A dry, 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a low temperature thermometer, and a solid addition assembly (Note 11) is charged with 97 g. (0.30 mole) of the dibromoketone and 700 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 12). After the reaction vessel has been flushed with nitrogen, a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the remainder of the reaction. The vigorously stirred solution is cooled to \u221270\u00b0 in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath before 80 g. (0.71 mole) of powdered potassium tert-butoxide (Note 13) is added over a 2-hour period. The addition is completed, the mixture is stirred an additional hour at \u221270\u00b0, and 50 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid is added dropwise. The cooling bath is then removed, and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The precipitated salts are filtered and washed with 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, and the filtrate and washing are combined. Most of the tetrahydrofuran is removed under reduced pressure, the nearly colorless residue is dissolved in 450 ml. of hexane (Note 14), and this solution is extracted twice with 100 ml. of water and once with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, leaving a pale-yellow oil which crystallizes upon standing. Sublimation of the crude product at 55\u00b0 (1 mm.) provides 39\u201341 g. (79\u201383%) of the cyclopropenone, m.p. 61\u201363\u00b0 (Note 15) and (Note 16).",
            "D. Tri-tert-butylcyclopropenyl tetrafluoroborate. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a nitrogen inlet system is charged with 56 ml. of a 2.34 M commercial solution of tert-butyllithium (0.126 mole) in pentane (Note 17) and cooled in an ice bath to 0\u00b0. A solution of 20.0 g. (0.120 mole) of di-tert-butylcyclopropenone in 200 ml. of pentane is added over 30 minutes, and then the ice bath is removed. The reaction mixture is stirred an additional 30 minutes, and the nearly colorless mixture is poured, with vigorous stirring, into 150 ml. of water. The pentane layer is separated, washed with two 75-ml. portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator, leaving a pale-yellow oil which is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and diluted with 600 ml. of ether. After cooling the ether solution to 0\u00b0 with an ice bath, a freshly prepared 10% solution of fluoroboric acid in acetic anhydride (Note 18) is added with rapid magnetic stirring. After the resulting suspension is stirred for 20 minutes the white precipitate is collected on a sintered glass funnel (medium porosity) under vacuum and washed thoroughly with 75-ml. portions of ether. The product is dissolved in a minimal amount of boiling acetone (ca. 300 ml.), cooled in a freezer (ca. \u221225\u00b0), filtered, and washed with ether, yielding 15.3 g. of tri-tert-butylcyclopropenyl tetrafluoroborate as white needles. Concentration of the mother liquors gives two additional crops (6.6 and 2.1 g.) of pure product, for a total yield of 24\u201328 g. (68\u201379%). When heated on a hot stage, the material darkens with decomposition above 300\u00b0 (Note 19)."

The system is flamed with a Bunsen burner as it is flushed with dry nitrogen. The reaction vessel is cooled under nitrogen in an ice bath, and 7.25 g. (0.125 mole) of 2-propen-1-ol (Note 1), 70 ml. of pentane (Note 2), and 1.16 g. (0.0100 mole) of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-ethanediamine (Note 3) are added successively through the rubber septum with a syringe. While maintaining a positive nitrogen pressure, 180 ml. of 1.5 M (0.270 mole) n-butyllithium in pentane (Note 4) is added from a syringe over a 20-minute period (Note 5). The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour (Note 6). The ice bath is then restored, the gas-inlet tube replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 70 ml. of water is added, cautiously at first, and then more rapidly after the exothermic reaction ceases. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the pentane layer is washed with a 10-ml. portion of 3 N hydrochloric acid, then two 10-ml. portions of water.

Erlenmeyer flask is stirred with 200 ml. of methanol (Note 4) for 5 minutes. The methanolic slurry of resin is transferred to a 6.5 cm. \u00d7 25 cm. chromatography column, using 50\u2013100 ml. of methanol to aid in the transfer. The resin column is washed with 750 ml. of methanol, added gradually so as to maintain about a 1\u20132.5 cm. solvent head above the upper resin level (Note 5). About two-thirds of the resin slurry is poured from the column (using about 100 ml. of methanol to aid the transfer) into a suspension of 19.9 g.

The resulting resin suspension is poured onto the column containing the remaining one-third of the resin. Additional methanol (ca. 50 ml.) is required to facilitate transferral. The column is eluted with about 500 ml. of methanol until the eluent no longer affords an alkaline reaction to pH paper (Note 7). The methanolic eluent is concentrated under reduced pressure (10\u201325 mm.), and the residual liquid (Note 8) is gradually heated to 100\u00b0 under the water-aspirator vacuum. Following completion of thermal decomposition, as evidenced by the end of gas evolution (ca. 5\u201310 minutes), the residue is dissolved in 250 ml. of ether (Note 9). The ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 0.2 N sulfuric acid and 100 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated, and distillation of the residue gives 8.5\u20139.0 g.

After flushing with argon, 30 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and 19.5 ml. of 1.89 M (0.0368 mole) methyllithium solution (Note 3) are injected through the septum into the flask (Note 4). A solution of 4.54 g. (0.0249 mole) of benzophenone (Note 5) in 35 ml. of anhydrous ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period. The mixture is allowed to stir for one half hour (Note 6). The septum is removed, and the side arm is quickly adapted with Tygon\u00ae tubing leading through a tower of solid potassium hydroxide to a tank of anhydrous ammonia. After approximately 75 ml. of ammonia is slowly distilled into the flask (Note 7), the tubing is removed, and 0.525 g. (0.0761 g.-atom, ca. 15 cm. added as 0.5 cm. pieces) of lithium wire (Note 8) is quickly added, and the flask is stoppered. After 15 minutes the dark blue color is discharged by the continuous addition of excess ammonium chloride (ca. 5 g. over a 15-minute period) (Note 9). The argon-inlet tube is disconnected, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is then partitioned between 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator yields 4.36\u20134.49 g. of crude product (Note 10). Filtration of the product through 60 g. of Woelm alumina (Grade III) with 150 ml. of petroleum ether affords 4.16\u20134.31 g.

While still warm, the bottom part of C is filled with 0.5 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and approximately 25 \u03bcl. of triethylamine (Note 4), greased, and stoppered. The top parts of B and C are thoroughly greased and connected to the 24/40 T joint of A. The bottom of part B is filled rapidly with 200 ml. of an approximately 1 M solution of dimsyl anion (Note 5) in dimethyl sulfoxide. The bottom part of C is then connected and cooled in a 2-propanol\u2013dry ice bath. The system is irradiated and subjected to a steady flow of nitrogen (approximately 400\u2013500 ml./minute). After the first hour, this flow rate is reduced to 200\u2013250 ml./minute for the remaining 4.5 hours.

            "A 200-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 11.6 g. (0.100 mole) of hexanoic acid (Note 1) and 10 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. After 46.9 g. (28.8 ml., 0.394 mole) of thionyl chloride (Note 2) is added to the solution, an efficient reflux condenser with an attached drying tube is fitted to the flask. The solution is stirred and heated with an oil bath at 65\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 3). The flask is removed from the oil bath and cooled to room temperature. To the reaction mixture are added successively 21.4 g. (0.120 mole) of finely powdered N-bromosuccinimide (Note 4), 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, and 7 drops of 48% hydrogen bromide (Note 5). The flask is heated at 70\u00b0 for 10 minutes (Note 6), before the temperature of the bath is increased to 85\u00b0, until the color of the reaction becomes light yellow (ca. 1.5 hours; (Note 7). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the carbon tetrachloride and excess thionyl chloride are removed under reduced pressure (Note 8). The residue is suction filtered, the solid (Note 9) is washed several times with carbon tetrachloride (total 20 ml.) and the combined filtrate collected in a 50-ml. flask. The solvent is removed from the solution as before, and the residue is distilled into a dry ice-cooled receiver (short-path column), giving, after a small forerun, 16.1\u201317.1 g. (76\u201380%) of 2-bromohexanoyl chloride, b.p. 44\u201347\u00b0 (1.5 mm.) as a clear, slightly yellow oil, n22D 1.4707. This material is of sufficient purity for most synthetic purposes (Note 10).\nThe yellow product (Note 11) is decolorized by dissolving it in an equal volume of carbon tetrachloride (ca. 12 ml.) and vigorously shaking the solution thus obtained with 1.5 ml. of freshly prepared aqueous 35% sodium thiosulfate. The two layers are completely separated after 5 minutes. The colorless bottom layer is drawn off into a 50-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The top layer is extracted three times with 1.5 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined carbon tetrachloride extracts are dried over 0.5 g. (Note 12) of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 minutes. The solution is filtered into a 50-ml. anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 minutes. The solution is filtered into a 50-ml. distilling flask, and the magnesium sulfate is washed several times with carbon tetrachloride (total 5 ml.). The solvent is removed, and the colorless product is distilled as described above, affording 14.7\u201315.8 g.

The solution is stirred for 30 minutes after the addition is complete, and the addition funnel is replaced by a clean one (125-ml. capacity), fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube (Note 6). Cooling is continued, a solution of 8.31 g. (0.0501 mole) of methyl anisate (Note 7) and (Note 8) in 100 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred mixture over a 6\u201310-minute period, and the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes (Note 9). At the end of this period, 300 ml. of 3 N hydrochloric acid is added. The nitrogen-inlet tube is removed and replaced by a reflux condenser, and the dropping funnel is replaced by a ground-glass stopper. The ice bath is removed, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. The flask is then cooled, and its contents are poured into a 2-l.

The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, which is combined with the original organic phase and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. Approximately 150 ml. of xylene is added to the flask and the contents of the flask are heated to reflux to remove any water present as the azeotrope. The resulting hot solution is filtered rapidly through a large B\u00fcchner funnel with light suction. The volume is reduced to approximately 100 ml., and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. The tan crystals which separate are collected in a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 10 ml. of ice-cold xylene.

(0.250 mole) of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (Note 1) and 125 ml. of acetic acid. The solution is stirred and heated at 80\u00b0 on a steam bath, while 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added rapidly and followed immediately with 40 ml. of formalin (37% formaldehyde, by weight, in water) (Note 2) and (Note 3). The yellow solution is stirred and heated on a steam bath for 1 hour, during which time the reaction temperature reaches 90\u00b0 (Note 4) and the solution assumes a dark-brown color. After cooling to room temperature the solution is poured, with stirring, into a mixture of 650 g. of chipped ice and 650 ml. of cold water. The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the organic material is extracted with four 300-ml. portions of chloroform (Note 5). The combined chloroform extracts are washed with 250-ml. portions of aqueous 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate until neutral (Note 6), then with two, 250-ml. portions of water, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator with a water bath up to a temperature of 55\u00b0 (Note 7), yielding 43.5\u201344.2 g.

Approximately 10 ml. of the 4-bromotoluene solution is added to the flask, and the contents are stirred until the Grignard reaction commences (Note 4). When the initial vigorous reaction has subsided the remainder of the 4-bromotoluene solution is added at a rate such that the mixture refluxes gently. Generally the addition is complete at the end of 1 hour, and almost all of the magnesium has dissolved. The mixture is refluxed for a further hour and cooled.

The reflux condenser is temporarily removed, and the solution of (4-methylphenyl)magnesium bromide is added to the flask as rapidly as possible through a large filter funnel fitted with a loose plug of glass wool (Note 6). A black solid precipitates almost immediately from solution. The reflux condenser is replaced, and the contents of the flask are refluxed with stirring for 4 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere.

(0.100 mole) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (Note 1) in 100 ml. of methanol. After the solution is cooled to 1\u20133\u00b0 in an ice bath, 34 g. (30 ml., 0.30 mole) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Note 2) is added. The mixture is stirred vigorously and kept well cooled in the ice bath, and 0.15 ml. (0.75 mmole) of 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added in one portion. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to approximately 30\u00b0 within a few minutes then falls again to 3\u20135\u00b0. Fifteen minutes after addition of the sodium hydroxide solution, the cold reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel containing 150 g. of ice and 200 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The resulting suspension is extracted with 200 ml. of dichloromethane. After two further extractions of the aqueous layer with 150-ml. portions of dichloromethane, the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 30-cm. Vigreux column (Note 3). Distillation of the residue through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure affords a forerun fraction of approximately 0.7 g., b.p. 60\u201375\u00b0 (11 mm.)

            "B. 5-Hexynal. To a solution of 5.60 g. (0.0500 mole) of 2,3-epoxycyclohexanone in 120 ml. of benzene in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask is added 10.82 g. (0.5152 mole) of trans-1-amino-2,3-diphenylaziridine [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 56 (1988)]. Initially, after brief swirling at room temperature, the reaction mixture is a colorless, homogeneous solution; however it rapidly turns yellow and cloudy due to separation of water. After 2 hours the benzene and water are removed as an azeotrope on a rotary evaporator with the bath maintained at approximately 30\u00b0. The resulting crude mixture of diastereomeric hydrazones weighs 15.4 g. (Note 7) and is subjected directly to fragmentation (Note 8).\nThe fragmentation is conveniently performed in a 100-ml., wide-necked (Note 9), round-bottomed flask with a side arm. The side arm is equipped with a capillary fitted with a balloon filled with argon or nitrogen. The capillary should be set so that it does not dip into the reaction mixture. The reaction flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a short assembly for distillation under reduced pressure. A dropping funnel extends through the stillhead to a level about that of the neck of the flask, and the receiver is cooled in an ice bath. A trap is positioned between the receiver and the vacuum source and cooled in a 2-propanol\u2013dry ice mixture. The reaction flask is immersed in an oil bath at 150\u2013155\u00b0, and the apparatus is evacuated to a pressure of 11 mm. The crude hydrazone mixture is dissolved in 20 ml. of diethyl phthalate (Note 10) and carefully added in small portions, from the funnel, into the heated flask, with the stirrer in operation. There is a rapid evolution of nitrogen, and 5-hexynal begins to distil. Addition of the entire hydrazone solution requires approximately 2 hours, after which the funnel is washed with 5 ml. of diethyl phthalate, and the temperature of the reaction flask is raised to 160\u2013165\u00b0. The reaction is complete when there is no further evolution of nitrogen. The last traces of product can be driven into the receiver by warming the stillhead with a heat gun.\nThe contents of the receiver and trap are combined with the aid of a few drops of dichloromethane and distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure. After only a few drops of forerun, 2.87\u20133.17 g. (60\u201366%) of 5-hexynal, b.p. 61\u201362\u00b0 (30 mm.), nD20 1.4447, d420 0.875 (Note 11),(Note 12),(Note 13), is collected. GC analysis (Note 14) shows this material to contain 3\u20135% of unidentified impurities with longer retention times (Note 15)."

Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. Over 1 hour, 91.5 g. (0.478 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 2) is added portionwise and with stirring to the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature at 0\u20135\u00b0. The resulting slurry is allowed to stand overnight (Note 3) in a refrigerator, then poured into 500 g. of an ice-water mixture. The reaction mixture is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are washed successively with four 150-ml. portions of 2 N sulfuric acid, 50 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and two 50-ml. portions of water.

Sodium hydride dispersion (Note 5), [19.2 g. of a 50% w/w suspension in mineral oil, 9.6 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium hydride] is placed in the flask, and 100 ml. of anhydrous pentane is added. After the dispersion has been stirred, the sodium hydride is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is removed with a pipet or a siphon. This washing operation is repeated with two additional 100-ml. portions of pentane, and 400 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 6) is then added to the reaction flask. To the vigorously stirred suspension of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide is added, dropwise over 30 minutes, 68 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate (Note 7). The mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained before all of the previously prepared crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate, dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 6), is added in one portion. The resulting solution is slowly heated to 100\u00b0, with continuous stirring, over a period of 3 hours. During this time the reaction becomes dark red, and crystalline sodium p-toluenesulfonate separates. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, then transferred to a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator.

A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a glass-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask, a low-temperature thermometer, an exit tube attached to a calcium chloride drying tube, and a Teflon\u00ae-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with a solution of 118 g. (1.40 moles) of dihydropyran (Note 1) in 400 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. While the solution is stirred continuously it is cooled to \u221230\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath. Anhydrous chlorine (Note 2) is passed through the solution and introduced at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction solution does not rise above \u221210\u00b0 (Note 3). Completion of the addition process (ca. 1 hour) is indicated by a rapid development of a yellow color (excess chlorine) in the reaction solution and a distinct decrease in the temperature of the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, several drops of dihydropyran are added to discharge the yellow color, and the colorless solution is stored at \u221230\u00b0 (Note 4) until it is used in the next step.",

(2.11 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. Methyl bromide (200 g., 2.15 moles) is allowed to distill (Note 5) into the continuously stirred reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. The formation of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide requires approximately 2 hours. The gas-inlet tube is then replaced with a dry, 1-l. dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice\u2013salt bath. The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0\u00b0), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether.

Stirring is begun, and the remaining portions of these solutions are transferred to the appropriate dropping funnels. The metaperiodate solution is added over a period of about 30 minutes, and the permanganate solution is added as needed to maintain a pink color (Note 3). Stirring is continued for an additional 1.5 hours (Note 4) before a solution of 20.0 g. of sodium bisulfite in 40 ml. of water is slowly added (Note 5).

(0.1849 mole) of (\u2212)-2,3:4,6-di-O-isopropylidene-2-keto-L-gulonic acid hydrate [(\u2212)-DAG] (Note 1) and 1.7 l. of acetone (Note 2) is placed in a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask. A boiling chip is added, and the mixture is heated to a gentle boil. To the resulting hot solution is added cautiously but rapidly, over a 1-minute period, 34.24 g. (0.2002 mole) of racemic \u03b1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (Note 3) in 100 ml. of acetone. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 4 hours. The (\u2212)-amine (\u2212)-DAG salt is filtered with suction, washed with 100 ml. of acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60\u00b0 to constant weight, yielding 73\u201376 g. of the crude (\u2212)-amine (\u2212)-DAG salt, m.p. 205\u2013207\u00b0 (dec.), (Note 4), [\u03b1]D25 \u221214.2\u00b0 (c 1.01%, methanol). The crude salt and 4.2 l. of ethanol (Note 5) are placed in a 5-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for about 4 hours, during which time a clear solution is obtained. The condenser is then placed in a descending position and approximately 1.4 l. of the ethanol is distilled at atmospheric pressure (Note 6), and stirring is continued (Note 7) at room temperature for about 16 hours. The purified salt is collected on a filter and dried to constant weight, yielding 36\u201337 g. of white needles, m.p. 216\u2013218\u00b0 (dec., (Note 4)), [\u03b1]D25 \u221217.5\u00b0 (c 1.02%, methanol). For recrystallization, the crude salt and 4.0 l. of ethanol are used. Removal of 3.0 l. of the solvent yields 33.5\u201333.9 g. (75\u201376%) of pure (\u2212)-amine (\u2212)-DAG salt as white needles, m.p. 219\u2013221\u00b0 (dec., (Note 4)), [\u03b1]D25 \u221218.5\u00b0 (c 0.90%, methanol).\nTo a slurry of 33.5\u201333.9 g. of the pure (\u2212)-amine (\u2212)-DAG salt in 130 ml. of water is added 56 ml. of 2 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the resulting oily suspension is extracted with four 80-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 50 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator, the crude base is distilled under reduced pressure through a 20-cm. Vigreux column (Note 8), affording 10.9\u201311.7 g. (85\u201390% yield, based on the amount of the salt used) of the pure (\u2212)-amine as a colorless liquid, b.p. 156\u2013157\u00b0 (11 mm.), nD24 1.6211\u20131.6212, d424 1.056, [\u03b1]D25 \u221280.1\u00b0 (neat), [\u03b1]D25 \u221260.4\u00b0 (c 10.0%, methanol), [\u03b1]D25 \u221259.3\u00b0 (c 0.65%, methanol) (Note 9) and (Note 10).",
            "B. Recovery of (\u2212)-DAG. The basic aqueous solution (about 186 ml.), obtained after removal of the (\u2212)-amine by ether extraction, is placed in a 600-ml. beaker and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 with an ice bath. The solution is magnetically stirred and carefully acidified with 2 N hydrochloric acid at 0\u20135\u00b0 to approximately pH 2 (Note 11). The precipitated (\u2212)-DAG is filtered without delay (Note 12), washed with 20 ml. of ice water, and air dried to constant weight, yielding 20.0\u201320.9 g.

Stirring is continued for 4 hours at 2\u20134\u00b0, with the flask cooled with an ice-water bath. The reaction mixture is mixed thoroughly with 600 g. of ice, and the dimesylate precipitates. After careful acidification of the mixture with 6 N hydrochloric acid to approximately pH 3 (Note 21), the dimesylate is suction filtered, washed twice with 100-ml. portions of ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. This product, which is still moist, is transferred to a separatory funnel and is shaken well with 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted further with two 20-ml. portions of dichloromethane.

Finely powdered styrene glycol dimesylate (20 g., 0.068 mole), m.p. 93\u201394\u00b0, is then added with gentle stirring at room temperature. To the resulting slurry is slowly added 600 ml. of pentane. The stirring speed should be adjusted in such a manner that the two phases mix somewhat, but the dimesylate\u2013hydrazine hydrate layer is not deposited on the upper walls of the flask. After 20\u201324 hours of stirring at room temperature two entirely clear layers can be observed upon the cessation of stirring (Note 22), indicating that the reaction is complete. The hydrazine hydrate is separated from the pentane and extracted with two 30-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane layers are filtered through cotton, which holds back any remaining droplets of hydrazine hydrate, into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask.

Three drops of acetic acid are added at first, and stirring is continued at 0\u00b0 until the precipitation of white 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate begins. If necessary, crystallization is initiated by scratching with a glass rod or by addition of a seed crystal from a previous run. The remainder of the acetic acid is added over a 10-minute period, and stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at 0\u00b0. The salt is filtered, washed with 30 ml. of pentane precooled to 0\u00b0, and dried in a vacuum desiccator (10 mm.) at room temperature, yielding 10.0\u201310.5 g.

Recrystallization is possible; however, it must be carefully carried out to avoid the formation of a yellow product, whose melting point is lower than that of the crude product. A solution of 10 g. of 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate in 40 ml. of dichloromethane is prepared at a maximum temperature of 20\u201322\u00b0.

            "A. Lithium phenylthio(tert-butyl)cuprate. A dry, 200-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, the top of which is connected to a nitrogen inlet. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 50 ml. of 1.60 M (0.080 mole) n-butyllithium (Note 1) solution is placed in the flask and cooled with an ice bath. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of 8.81 g. (0.0801 mole) of freshly distilled thiophenol (Note 2) in 30 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) is added dropwise to the cooled, stirred solution. An aliquot of the resulting solution (Note 4) is standardized by quenching in water, followed by titration with 0.10 N hydrochloric acid to a green end point with a bromocresol indicator. The concentration of lithium thiophenoxide prepared in this manner is typically 1.0 M.\nA dry, 250-ml., three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 5), a glass stopper, and a rubber septum through which are inserted hypodermic needles used to evacuate the flask and to admit nitrogen. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 4.19 g. (0.0220 mole) of purified copper(I) iodide (Note 6) is added, and while warming with a flame, the apparatus is evacuated, then refilled with nitrogen. After this procedure has been performed twice, the flask is allowed to cool, the stopper is replaced with a thermometer, and 45 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added (Note 3) with a hypodermic syringe. With continuous stirring, 22 ml. of 1.0 M (0.022 mole) lithium thiophenoxide solution is added with a syringe to the slurry of copper(I) iodide. After 5 minutes, the resulting yellow solution is cooled, with continuous stirring, to \u221265\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice cooling bath. Some copper(I) thiophenoxide usually separates from solution at ca. \u221245\u00b0. When the temperature of the mixture has reached ca. \u221265\u00b0, 13.6 ml. (0.0218 mole) of 1.60 M tert-butyllithium (Note 7) solution is added with a syringe to the stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture remains at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0. The resulting cloudy yellow-orange solution of the cuprate reagent is stirred at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0 for 5 minutes (Note 8).",

(0.0200 mole) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride (Note 9) in 15 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) is added dropwise, with stirring, to the cold solution (\u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0) of the cuprate reagent. The resulting yellow-brown solution is stirred for 20 minutes (at \u221260\u00b0 to \u221265\u00b0) and quenched by the addition, with a syringe, of 5 ml. of anhydrous methanol. The red-orange reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then poured into 100 ml. of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride. The copious precipitate of copper(I) thiophenoxide is separated by suction filtration and washed thoroughly with several 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is washed with two 50-ml. portions of aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide and with one 50-ml. portion of aqueous 2% sodium thiosulfate. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted in turn with a fresh 50-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by distillation through a short Vigreux column.

(2.00 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings (Note 5). The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen and thoroughly dried with a heat gun, and 300 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 6) is added. The Grignard reaction is initiated by adding about 10% of a solution of 243.0 g. (1.98 moles) of 3-chloro-N,N-dimethyl-1-propylamine in 300 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 6), and 4 ml. of ethyl bromide while gently heating the flask with the drier (Note 7). The remainder of the 3-chloro-N,N-dimethyl-1-propylamine solution is added over a period of approximately 1 hour so as to maintain gentle reflux. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 3 hours, after which time most of the magnesium has reacted. The dark gray solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 before a solution of 107.3 g.

A greenish precipitate is formed locally where the phosphine is added. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for 2 hours, during which time a heavy, greenish precipitate is formed. After cooling to room temperature, 600 ml. of ether (Note 10) is added, and the reaction mixture is left standing overnight, during which time the precipitate separates to the bottom of the flask. The solution is decanted into a 3-l. separatory funnel containing 300 ml. of 40% aqueous potassium hydroxide and 1 kg. of ice. The remainder of the reaction product is suction filtered with the aid of 1200 ml. of 5:1 ether\u2013dichloromethane through a 3-cm. layer of Celite\u00ae (Note 11).
