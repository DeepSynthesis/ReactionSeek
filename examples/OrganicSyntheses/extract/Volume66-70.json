            "A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a low-temperature thermometer, and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter (Note 1). The flask is charged with 30.0 g (0.234 mol) of 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propyn-1-ol (Note 2) and 230 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 3), and then cooled with an ice bath while 84 mL of a 2.8 M solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (Note 4) is added at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 10\u00b0C. Approximately 1.5 hr is required for the addition, after which time the gray solution is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 30 min, and then cooled below \u221270\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. Methanesulfonyl chloride (26.8 g, 0.234 mol) (Note 5) is added over 10 min via syringe, and after 30 min the cold bath is removed and the pale-yellow reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2 hr.\nA 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a vacuum adapter and two glass stoppers (Note 1) is charged with 21.4 g (0.246 mol) of anhydrous lithium bromide and 35.3 g (0.246 mol) of anhydrous cuprous bromide (Note 6). The reaction vessel is evacuated and the contents are briefly heated with a Bunsen burner flame. After 30 min the vacuum is replaced by nitrogen and the apparatus is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and two rubber septa. Dry tetrahydrofuran (260 mL) (Note 3) is added, and the resulting green solution containing a small amount of undissolved solid is cooled with an ice bath while 84 mL of a 2.8 M solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (Note 4) is added rapidly via syringe over 1\u20132 min. After 20 min of further stirring at 0\u00b0C, the reaction mixture appears as a viscous yellow-green suspension. The solution of the mesylate derivative of 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propyn-1-ol prepared above is now transferred via cannula over 45 min to the reaction mixture, which is cooled below \u221270\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. After 30 min, the cold bath is removed and the green reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The blue-gray mixture is then poured into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetically stirred mixture of 400 mL of pentane, 200 mL of water, and 400 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The organic phase is separated and washed successively with two 200-mL portions of saturated ammonium chloride solution, ten 1-L portions of water (Note 7), and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the drying agent is removed by filtration. The solvent is removed from the filtrate by atmospheric distillation through a 10-cm Vigreux column. The residual liquid is carefully distilled through a 12-cm column packed with glass helices to give 21.3\u201322.2 g, (72\u201375%) of 1-methyl-1-(trimethylsilyl)allene as a colorless liquid, bp 111\u00b0C (Note 8),(Note 9),(Note 10)(Note 11)."

The flask is charged with 25.0 g (0.255 mol) of ethyl propiolate (Note 1), 14 mL of dichloromethane, and 440 mL of water. The mixture is cooled to 5\u00b0C (Note 2) and 90 mL (0.35 mol) of an aqueous 25% solution of trimethylamine (Note 3) is added under vigorous stirring over a 30-min period. The reaction temperature remains between 0 and 5\u00b0C during the addition and then is allowed to warm to 25\u00b0C for 3 hr. The dichloromethane layer is separated and the aqueous layer is washed 3 times with 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The aqueous layer is placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and concentrated at 15 mm pressure with a rotary evaporator equipped with a dry-ice condenser. The flask is heated to approximately 45\u00b0C. When the residue gives the appearance of a wet solid, it is treated with 150 mL of dioxane and concentrated as described above. Dioxane treatment followed by concentration is repeated 3 more times with 150-mL portions of dioxane (Note 4). The yellow solid residue is triturated with acetonitrile (Note 5) until a white solid is obtained. The solid is collected and dried at 0.1 mm, 25\u00b0C for 14 hr to give 25.0\u201326.9 g (76\u201382% yield) of (E)-(carboxyvinyl)trimethylammonium betaine, mp 176\u2013177\u00b0C (dec) (Note 6).\nB. (E)-3-[(E)-3-Phenyl-2-propenoxy]acrylic acid. An oven dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser is purged with argon and charged with 8.20 g (0.171 mol) of 50% sodium hydride in oil (Note 7) and 90 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 8). To this mixture is added a solution of 19.0 g (0.143 mol) of cinnamyl alcohol (Note 9) in 180 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at which point 25.0 g (0.194 mol) of (E)-(carboxyvinyl)trimethylammonium betaine is added and the reaction mixture is heated at a gentle reflux for 15 hr. The cooled reaction mixture is slowly added to a mixture of 600 mL of water and 220 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (Note 10). The residual material is removed with wet ether (Note 11) and added to the aqueous solution. The aqueous layer is washed 3 times with 450 mL of ether and acidified with approximately 21 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid to pH 1. This mixture is extracted 3 times with 700 mL of ether and the ether layer is dried with 20 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 min. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated, first with a rotary evaporator and then at 0.1 mm for 24 hr at 25\u00b0C to give crude (E)-3-[(E)-3-phenyl-2-propenoxy]acrylic acid. This material can be used in Part C without further purification. However, purification by trituration with approximately 30 mL of anhydrous ether gives 24.7\u201325.0 g (85% yield) of white crystalline product, mp 140\u2013141.5\u00b0C (dec) (Note 12).\nC. 3-Phenyl-4-pentenal.

The flask is fitted with a distillation head for vacuum distillation and heated at 0.1 mm pressure. The oil-bath temperature is maintained at 160\u2013165\u00b0C while the mixture is stirred, until all the material melts. Once the initial reaction is under control, the oil bath is slowly heated to 180\u00b0C. The product is collected in a receiver flask cooled with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath to give 13.3\u201314.3 g (84\u201391% yield) of 3-phenyl-4-pentenal, bp 114\u2013115\u00b0C (15 mm) (Note 14)."

Methyl 1,3-dimethyl-5-oxobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylate.2 An oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and 5.56 g (55 mmol) of anhydrous diisopropylamine. The flask is flushed with argon via a needle inlet\u2013outlet and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath (Note 1),(Note 2),(Note 3). To the stirred solution is added dropwise with a syringe 30 mL (54 mmol) of a 1.8 M solution of butyllithium in hexane (Note 4) to form lithium diisopropylamide, followed after 30 min by a solution of 5.50 g (50 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one (Note 5) in 60 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran via a flex-needle over a 15-min period. Stirring and cooling is continued for an additional 30 min. To the resulting yellow solution of the lithium dienolate, 10.0 g (0.1 mol) of methyl (E)-crotonate (Note 6) is added with a syringe within 2 min. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 7). Stirring is continued at room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction mixture is quenched by adding 1 N hydrochloric acid until the mixture turns acidic. Extraction with three 80-mL portions of dichloromethane followed by evaporation of the solvent yields a light-yellow oil that is taken up in 100 mL of diethyl ether. This solution is filtered through 100 g of silica gel to remove polymers and water. Elution with diethyl ether and evaporation of the solvent gives a yellow oil that is distilled in a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus (Note 8) under reduced pressure. After a small forerun (ca. 0.5 g of unreacted 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one) at 50\u00b0C, 0.05 mm, the main fraction is collected at 110\u2013120\u00b0C (oven temperature), 0.05 mm to give 8.25\u20139.43 g (78\u201390%) of a colorless oil, which solidifies on standing in the freezer. One recrystallization from cold pentane (approximately 10 mL of pentane per 8 g of ester mixture) gives 6.0 g of product as white crystals, mp 37\u00b0C (Note 9), of approximately 97% isomeric purity (Note 10).\nB. 1,3-Dimethyl-5-oxobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylic acid.

This takes about 1 day. Methanol is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the remaining dark solution is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL), acidified to pH 1 with dilute sulfuric acid, and extracted with dichloromethane (4 \u00d7 50 mL). The organic layer is filtered through 100 g of silica gel and eluted with ether to remove most of the dark impurities. Concentration under reduced pressure gives 10.0 g of acid mixture. Distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 180\u00b0C, 0.03 mm and one recrystallization from ether-pentane gives 7.0 g (67%) of pure bicyclic acid (isomeric purity >98%) as white crystals, mp 130\u2013131\u00b0C (Note 11)."

            "In a tared 1-L, three-necked flask, two necks of which are covered with rubber septa and the other connected to a nitrogen-vacuum source, is placed 17.2 g of zinc chloride (Note 1). The flask is evacuated to approximately 2 mm and heated with a burner with swirling until practically all of the salt melts. The flask is cooled and filled with nitrogen. The dried salt weighs 16.4\u201317 g (ca. 0.12 mol) (Note 2). An efficient magnetic stirring bar and a Dimroth condenser in place of a rubber septum are set in position, and the flask is again flushed with nitrogen. Ether (300 mL) (Note 3) is introduced via the septum, and stirring is initiated and maintained throughout the reaction. The mixture is refluxed gently for 1 hr to aid dissolution of the solid state (Note 4). The flask is cooled, and 1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxycyclopropane (41.80 g, 0.24 mol) (Note 5) is introduced with the aid of a hypodermic syringe during 5 min. The cloudy mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr; the more dense lower layer may have mostly disappeared at this point. The mixture is refluxed for 30 min to complete homoenolate formation. The clear, colorless solution of the zinc homoenolate and chlorotrimethylsilane is cooled in an ice bath, and cuprous bromide/dimethyl sulfide complex (0.4 g, 2 mmol) (Note 6) is added by removing the septum while nitrogen adequate to exclude air is introduced through the inlet. 2-Cyclohexen-1-one (9.62 g, 0.1 mmol) (Note 7) is introduced via the septum during 1 min, and then hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) (34.8 mL, 0.2 mol) (Note 8) and (Note 9) is added during 5 min. A slightly exothermic reaction occurs initially and the bath is removed after 20 min. After 3 hr at room temperature, 40 g of silica gel (Note 10) and 300 mL of dry hexane (Note 11) are added while the mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 min. The supernatant liquid is decanted, and the residue is suspended in 60 mL of dry ether. Dry hexane (60 mL) is added and the supernatant liquid is decanted. This extractive procedure is repeated once and the combined organic phase is filtered through Celite (Note 12). After concentration with a rotary evaporator, the oily product is distilled under reduced pressure (ca. 2 mm). 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxycyclopropane (8\u201310 g) is recovered as the first fraction (bp 26\u00b0C at 2.3 mm). The majority of the HMPA remaining after workup distils at 80\u2013120\u00b0C/2.3 mm. Finally, the desired product (18.9\u201320.5 g, 70\u201376%) is obtained as a fraction boiling at 130\u2013132\u00b0C/2.3 mm (Note 13)."

The mixture is, in turn, added to 16.3 g (120 mmol) of dry zinc chloride (Note 6) and 60 mL of tetrahydrofuran placed in a similarly equipped, 500-mL flask using a 16-gauge double-ended needle under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen; the resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature.\nB. 2-Methyl-4'-nitrobiphenyl. To a mixture of 1.16 g (1 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Note 7), 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 20.2 g (100 mmol) of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (Note 8) in a 500-mL flask, set up as described above and immersed in a water bath, is added the o-tolylzinc chloride solution prepared above. The reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hr at room temperature and poured onto a mixture of 100 mL of ether and 300 mL of ice-cold 3 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator to give a light-brown solid. The solid is recrystallized from 300 mL of hexane to yield 16.0 g of yellow crystals. The second crop from 50 mL of hexane is 2.4 g. The combined product is recrystallized from 100 mL of ethanol to afford 16.0 g of light-yellow needles. Crystallization of the mother liquor from 25 mL of ethanol gives a second crop of 0.5 g. The total yield of 2-methyl-4'-nitrobiphenyl is 16.5 g (78% based on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) (Note 9)."

            "A. (3-Methyl-2-butenyl)propanedioic acid, dimethyl ester (1). To a 500-mL, flame-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask under an argon atmosphere and fitted with a thermometer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is added 250 mL of methanol (Note 1). The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 6.7 g (0.29 mol) of sodium is added cautiously (Note 2). After the sodium has dissolved, the ice bath is removed, 36.9 g (0.28 mol) of dimethyl malonate (Note 1) is added at room temperature, and the solution is stirred for 0.5 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and 45.8 g (0.31 mol) of 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide (Note 1) is added dropwise while the temperature is maintained near 5\u00b0C (Note 3). After 1 hr (Note 4), the reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask with the aid of a small amount of methanol and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The white residue is taken up in 400 mL of ether and 300 mL of a saturated salt/saturated sodium bicarbonate (1 : 1) solution and is transferred to a separatory funnel. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (1 \u00d7 200 mL). The ether layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue through a 6-in. Vigreux column (after a small forerun is collected) yields 43.9\u201344.5 g (78\u201379%) of 1, bp 60\u201363\u00b0C (0.15 mm) (Note 5).\nB. (3-Methyl-2-butenyl)(2-propynyl)propanedioic acid, dimethyl ester (2). To a 1-L, flame-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (Note 6) and under an argon atmosphere, is added 9.0 g (0.19 mol) of sodium hydride dispersion (Note 7). The sodium hydride is washed with petroleum ether (4 \u00d7 30 mL), removing the petroleum ether by pipette after the sodium hydride has settled. The flask is then fitted with a thermometer and an over-dried pressure-equalizing addition funnel and charged with 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 7). The heterogenous mixture is cooled with an ice bath, and 36.4 g (0.18 mol) of the monoalkyl diester (1) is added dropwise at the rate of 1 drop/2\u20133 sec (Note 2). The cooling bath is removed when the addition is complete, and the solution is stirred until no more gas evolves (ca. 1 hr). The reaction mixture is recooled to 0\u00b0C, and 22 mL of propargyl bromide solution (0.20 mol) (Note 7) is added dropwise while the temperature is maintained at 0\u201310\u00b0C. Sodium bromide begins to precipitate within 20 min. The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight (Note 8). After careful addition of 50 mL of water (Note 9) and removal of the stirring bar, the solution is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is taken up in 500 mL of ether and washed with water (3 \u00d7 300 mL) and saturated salt solution (1 \u00d7 100 mL). The aqueous layers are combined, saturated with salt, and extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 150 mL). The ether layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus at 80\u00b0C (0.25 mm) to yield 34.0\u201334.2 g (79\u201380%) of (Note 10).\nC. (Z)-3-Tributylstannylmethylene-4-isopropyl-1,1-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester (3). A flame-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with argon, and 23.8 g (0.100 mol) of dialkylmalonate diester (2), 30.2 g (<0.104 mol) of tributyltin hydride (Note 11), and 40 mg (0.25 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (Note 12) are added neat (Note 13) and (Note 14). The entire assembly is lowered into an oil bath maintained at 75\u201385\u00b0C, and the mixture is stirred. After an induction period of less than 30 min, an exothermic reaction occurs and produces a small amount of gas and a rise in the temperature of the oil bath (as much as 20\u00b0C for a small bath). After this point TLC shows that the reaction is essentially complete (Note 15)(Note 16)(Note 17). Unpurified 3 thus obtained is suitable for protodestannylation.\nD. 3-Methylene-4-isopropyl-1,1-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester (4). Crude vinylstannane (3) is transferred to a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 L of dichloromethane, 350 g of silica (Note 18), and a large (7 \u00d7 3-cm, egg-shaped) stirring bar. The flask is stoppered, and the mixture is stirred for 24\u201348 hr (Note 19). The mixture is divided into three portions. Each portion is filtered under reduced pressure with a 600-mL glass frit, and the silica is washed with ethyl acetate (8 \u00d7 200 mL) to extract all of the desired product (Note 20). The solution is filtered through Celite and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator. Distillation through a short-path distillation apparatus (with no forerun) gives 19.8\u201320.5 g of 4 (83\u201385% overall from 2), bp 80\u00b0\u201385\u00b0C (0.2 mm) (Note 21)."

            "A. 1-Iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane. In a dry, 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a rubber septum is placed 15.0 g (0.10 mol) of sodium iodide. A nitrogen inlet tube is connected to the top of the reflux condenser and all the apparatus is kept under nitrogen. To this vessel are added 50 mL of acetone and 11.5 mL (10 g, 0.066 mol) of 1-chloro-3-trimethylsilylpropane (Note 1) with a hypodermic syringe through the septum; the resulting white suspension is stirred under reflux for 24 hr. The condenser is replaced with a Claisen head, and the bulk of the solvent is removed under ordinary pressure (Note 2) to give a white slurry. To this is added 60 mL of hexane and the inorganic salts are filtered off by suction. The filter cake is washed with five 10-mL portions of hexane. The hexane is distilled off from the combined organic portions at atmospheric pressure. The residual oil is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirring bar and a Claisen head, and is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 1-iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane 1 (11.5\u201313.1 g, 72\u201381%), bp 84\u201386\u00b0C (25 mm), as a clear liquid (Note 3) and (Note 4).\nB. 2-Methyl-2-vinylcyclopentanone. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen inlet tube, and a rubber septum is kept under dry nitrogen. To this flask are introduced 8.3 mL (5.99 g, 0.0591 mol) of diisopropylamine and 120 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 5) with a syringe through the septum. The flask is cooled in a dry ice\u2013hexane bath. To the solution is slowly added 38.7 mL of butyllithium (1.53 M in hexane, 0.0592 mol) with a syringe and the mixture is kept at 0\u00b0C (in an ice bath) for 10 min. The resulting solution of lithium diisopropylamide is again cooled in a dry ice\u2013hexane bath (\u221278\u00b0C), and 11.2 mL (11.57 g, 0.0645 mol) of N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) (Note 6) is added. After stirring for 30 min, 6.47 mL (6.15 g, 0.0539 mol) of methyl tiglate is injected drop by drop at \u221278\u00b0C. After the solution is stirred for an additional 20 min, 13.0 g (0.0537 mol) of 1-iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane 1 is added with a syringe and the dry ice\u2013hexane bath is replaced with an ice bath. The solution is stirred at about 0\u00b0C for 1 hr and then poured onto 150 mL of ice-cooled 3 N hydrochloric acid covered with 150 mL of hexane. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 80-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic layers are washed successively with 50 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid and 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford the crude ester 2 (ca. 13 g) (Note 7), which is sufficiently pure for the next operation.\nIn a two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a reflux condenser, the top of which is fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, is placed 7.3 g (ca. 0.13 mol) of 85% pure potassium hydroxide. To the flask are added 4 mL of water and an ethanol solution (60 mL) of the crude ester 2 (ca. 13 g) with a syringe; the mixture is refluxed for 1 hr. The reflux condenser is replaced with a Claisen head and the bulk of the solvent is distilled off over 30 min (Note 8). The residue is cooled in an ice bath and 80 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid is cautiously introduced. The mixture is extracted with 150 mL of hexane and the organic layer is separated. To the aqueous layer is added 40 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and the solution is again extracted with two 100-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude acid 3 (10.6\u201312.0 g) as a dark-colored oil (Note 9).\nA 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen. To this flask is introduced a dry benzene solution (50 mL) of crude acid 3 through the septum. Then 8.9 mL (12.9 g, 0.101 mol) of oxalyl chloride is slowly added with stirring at room temperature. After the evolution of gas ceases, the solution is further heated in an oil bath maintained at 70\u00b0C for 30 min. The solvent, together with excess oxalyl chloride, is removed at room temperature first on a rotary evaporator and finally with a vacuum pump to leave the crude acid chloride of 3 as a dark-colored oil (Note 10).\nIn a 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an nitrogen inlet tube, a dropping funnel, and a rubber septum are placed 7.45 g (0.0559 mol) of powdered aluminum chloride and a magnetic stirring bar. After 100 mL of dichloromethane (Note 11) is introduced, the crude acid chloride, dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, is added via the dropping funnel to the stirred suspension of aluminum chloride at 0\u00b0C over 5 min, whereupon most of the aluminum chloride dissolves. After further stirring at 0\u00b0C for 15 min and at room temperature for 15 min, the flask is recooled in an ice bath and 100 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid is cautiously added through the dropping funnel. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted 3 times with 50-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are successively washed with 30 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid and 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed under ordinary pressure and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 2-methyl-2-vinylcyclopentanone as a clear liquid (3.74\u20135.6 g, 56\u201384% yield based on the methyl tiglate), bp 104\u2013124\u00b0C (110 mm) (Note 12), ca. 95% pure by GLC (Note 13)."

            "A. Dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)(ethyl vinyl ether)iron tetrafluoroborate (1). A 500-mL, three-necked flask, with a stopcock at the bottom, is fitted with a nitrogen inlet and a mechanical stirrer with a Teflon paddle. Nitrogen is passed through the flask while it is flame-dried (Note 1) and then 70 mL of mercury is introduced. The mercury is stirred vigorously as 7.2 g (0.31 mol) of sodium metal, cut into small pieces, and added slowly under a strong flow of nitrogen; after which the remaining neck is capped with a rubber septum. The amalgam is allowed to cool to room temperature and 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added (Note 2) and (Note 3). While the system is flushed with nitrogen, one septum is removed and 35.4 g (0.1 mol) of dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)diiron [(CO)2CpFe]2 (Note 4) is added at once. Vigorous stirring is continued for 40 min. The mercury is drained through the stopcock, and the deep-yellow-red solution of sodium dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)ferrate, which is ready for use without further purification, is transferred (Note 2) to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirrer. An additional 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is used to rinse the amalgam flask.\nChloroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal (31.11 g, 0.20 mol) (Note 5) is added by syringe slowly, since the initial reaction is exothermic. The resulting solution is heated at 50\u00b0C with stirring for 2 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, solvent is removed, first with a rotary evaporator and then with an oil pump overnight (Note 6). The residue is taken up in ethyl ether (Note 7), and filtered by suction through a 1\u00bd-in. plug of Celite packed in a 250-mL, coarse-porosity, fritted Schlenk tube (Note 8) and (Note 9). The filtrate is collected in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar. The sodium chloride residue is washed several times with fresh ether until the washings are nearly colorless. The filter tube is removed and the flask is capped with a rubber septum and a nitrogen inlet; air is displaced by flushing the flask is capped with nitrogen.\nThe solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath, and 38.19 g (0.23 mol) of tetrafluoroboric acid\u2013diethyl ether complex (Note 10) is added dropwise by syringe over a 30-min period. The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. The yellow precipitate is filtered off and collected in a 250-mL Schlenk tube, washed with ether, and dried under a stream of nitrogen and finally under reduced pressure (oil pump). The bright-yellow salt 1 weighs 43.2\u201357.6 g (60\u201380%) and may be used without further purification (Note 11). It may be stored indefinitely under nitrogen at 0\u00b0C without decomposition.\nB. Dicarbonyl(cyclopentadientyl)(trans-3-methyl-2-vinylcyclohexanone)iron tetrafluoroborate (3). Under a nitrogen atmosphere, cuprous iodide (Note 12) (24.76 g, 0.13 mol) and 150 mL of ether are placed in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar, and cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice\u2013salt bath. First 172 mL (0.26 mol) of methyllithium in ether (Note 13) is added by syringe, then 12.60 g (0.13 mol) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (Note 14) is added dropwise by syringe while the mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C. A bright yellow precipitate forms immediately. After 15 min, 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added and the mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. While vigorous stirring and a strong flow of nitrogen are maintained, one septum is removed and 43.70 g (0.13 mol) of complex salt 1 is added at once. The septum is replaced and 50 mL of fresh tetrahydrofuran is used to wash solid 1 from the neck and sides of the reaction vessel. After 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature while stirring is continued. Stirring is halted to allow insoluble copper salts to settle, leaving a red supernatant liquid. A 250-mL, coarse-frit, Schlenk filter is prepared with a Celite mat, topped with 2 in. of activity-IV neutral alumina (Note 15), which is further deactivated by washing in the Schlenk tube with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The supernatant solution is transferred to the Schlenk tube by cannula and filtered by suction into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar. The copper salts remaining in the reaction vessel are repeatedly washed with fresh ether until the filtered washings are nearly colorless. Removal of solvent from the filtrate leaves product 2 as a deep red oil (Note 16).\nThe oil is dissolved in 500 mL of diethyl ether under a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and 18 g (0.11 mol) of tetrafluoroboric acid\u2013diethyl ether complex is added dropwise by syringe over a 30-min period, while the bath temperature is maintained at \u221278\u00b0C. The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature, and the powdery yellow solid is isolated by filtration through a 250-mL, coarse-frit, Schlenk filter tube. The product is washed several times with fresh ether and dried under a stream of nitrogen and then under reduced pressure (oil pump). The yield of salt 3 is 31\u201339.1 g (60\u201375%). The product may be used without further purification (Note 17) and may be stored under nitrogen of 0\u00b0C for several weeks with no observable decomposition (Note 18).\nC. trans-3-Methyl-2-vinylcyclohexanone (4). Compound 3 (31.5 g) and 25 mL of acetonitrile (0.47 mol, 6-fold excess) (Note 19) are placed in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask (Note 20) fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hr under nitrogen, cooled to room temperature, and slowly added to 300 mL of diethyl ether. The acetonitrile complex 5 precipitates as a bright yellow solid, and may be removed by suction filtration (Note 21).\nThe filtrate is washed 3 times with distilled water to remove excess acetonitrile and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration followed by removal of ether leaves the product 4 as a yellow oil (7.1\u20137.6 g, 64\u201370%), which may be further purified by short path or bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 30\u00b0C at 0.1 mm) to a colorless liquid (Note 22) and (Note 23)."

            "A. S-tert-Butyl 3-oxobutanthioate. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (Note 1) fitted with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, a magnetic stirring bar, and an argon inlet is charged with 9.8 g (0.24 mol) of sodium hydride as a 60% dispersion in oil (Note 2). The system is flushed with, and kept under, dry argon. The sodium hydride is washed with two 40-mL portions of sodium-dried pentane and the system is purged with dry argon to remove traces of pentane. To the flask is then added 900 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 3).\nThe flask is cooled in an ice\u2013salt bath to \u22125\u00b0C and a solution of 20 g (25 mL, 0.22 mol) of 2-methylpropane-2-thiol (Note 2) in 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added at such a rate as to maintain a steady evolution of hydrogen. The slightly exothermic reaction causes the temperature to rise to 0\u00b0C and the colorless solution is stirred at this temperature for 15 min to ensure complete formation of the thiolate. The reaction mixture is then recooled to \u22125\u00b0C and 20.3 g (18.8 mL, 0.24 mol) of diketene (Note 2) is added over 15 min to give a yellow-green solution. The cooling bath is removed and the solution allowed to warm to room temperature.\nThe reaction is quenched and excess sodium hydride is destroyed by careful addition of 300 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The two-phase mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel charged with 400 mL of ether. The layers are separated and the organic phase is washed with 300-mL portions of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and Brine. The aqueous washes are reextracted with a 400-mL portion of ether and the combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator to give the crude product as a deep-red oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 4) at 95\u2013100\u00b0C (0.9 mm) gives 22 g (57%) of S-tert-butyl 3-oxobutanthioate as a colorless oil (Note 5).\nB. 1-Carbomethoxy-1-methylethyl 3-oxobutanoate. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 10 g (0.085 mol) of methyl 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (Note 2), 17.7 g (0.102 mol) of S-tert-butyl 3-oxobutanthioate, and 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The flask is placed in the dark and 22.5 g (0.102 mol) of freshly prepared silver(I) trifluoroacetate (Note 6) is added in two portions. The resulting dark-brown suspension is stirred for 15 min (Note 7) and then concentrated to approximately 50 mL with a rotary evaporator. The concentrated mixture is diluted with 200 mL of hexane and the resulting orange-brown precipitate is removed by filtration. The filtered solid is washed with two 50-mL portions of hexane and the combined filtrate and washings concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give an orange-brown oil.\nThe crude product is chromatographed on 350 g of silica (Note 8) using 1 : 1 ether-petroleum ether (40\u201360) as eluant. The chromatography is monitored by TLC (Note 9) and the appropriate fractions are combined. Removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator gives a pale-orange oil (Note 10), which was further purified by distillation to give 11.7 g (68%) of the O-ester, bp 69\u201372\u00b0C (0.2 mm) (Note 11).\nC. 3-Acetyl-4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethylfuran-2(5H)-one. A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 5 g (0.025 mol) of the acetoacetate and 37 mL (0.037 mol) of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1 M solution in THF) (Note 2) is added over 5 min. The resulting solution is stirred vigorously for 3 hr (Note 12) and then transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel containing 50 mL of 6 M hydrochloric acid. The acidified mixture is extracted with three 30-mL portions of ether, each extract being washed with 10 mL of Brine. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give 4.3 g of the crude tetronic acid as a yellow solid. Recrystallization from 25 mL of hot 5% ether\u2013petroleum ether gives 1.9 g of the tetronic acid as pale-yellow plates, mp 66\u201367\u00b0C (lit.2: mp 64\u201365\u00b0C) (Note 13). Concentration of the mother liquor affords a second crop of 0.4 g, mp 63\u201365\u00b0C, giving a combined yield of 54%."

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer (Note 1), and a three-way stopcock fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium chloride and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 50 mL of dichloromethane (Note 2) and 3.07 (0.042 mol) of N,N-dimethylformamide (Note 3) added through the septum from a syringe, and cooled in an ice bath. To the cooled mixture is slowly added 5.23 mL (0.06 mol) of oxalyl chloride (Note 4) by means of a syringe. The addition is accompanied by gas evolution and formation of a white precipitate. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour at 0\u00b0C. Excess oxalyl chloride and solvent are removed under reduced pressure by first using a water aspirator and then a rotary pump at room temperature through the drying tube. The white solid remaining in the flask is N,N-dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride, which is used directly in Part B.\nB. 6-Oxodecanal. The drying tube is removed and the flask is flushed with nitrogen. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. A dropping funnel is attached and charged with 7.45 g (0.04 mol) of 6-oxodecanoic acid (Note 5), 3.32 g of pyridine (Note 6), and 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 7), which are mixed well by shaking.

The flask is charged with lithium (4.2 g, 0.6 mol, (Note 2)) and 1,3-diaminopropane (300 mL, (Note 3)). The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. A slight exothermic reaction takes place as the lithium dissolves.\nThe mixture is stirred and heated in an oil bath at 70\u00b0C until the blue color discharges (ca. 3 hr), affording a white suspension of the lithium amide.

The resultant pale yellow solution is stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and then 2-decyn-1-ol (15.4 g, 0.1 mol, (Note 5)) is added over 10 min by means of the dropping funnel (Note 6). Residual 2-decyn-1-ol is washed into the flask with 1,3-diaminopropane (20 mL). The reddish-brown mixture is stirred for 30 min and then poured into 1 L of ice water and extracted 4 times with 500-mL portions of hexane. The hexane extracts are combined and washed succesively with 1 L each of water, 10% hydrochloric acid, and saturated sodium chloride solution. The hexane solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The crude product is distilled under reduced pressure to give 9-decyn-1-ol (12.8\u201313.5 g, 83\u201388%) (Note 7) and (Note 8), as a colorless oil, bp 86\u201388\u00b0C/0.5 mm."

            "A. Cyclobutanecarboxamide. (See (Note 1).) A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a drying tube (Drierite), is flame-dried and allowed to cool to room temperature. The flask is equipped with a punctured rubber septum, through which is inserted a \u221290\u00b0 thermometer. The flask is subjected to a nitrogen atmosphere by inserting a syringe needle connected to a nitrogen bubbler through the septum along with a second syringe needle used as an outlet. Under a flow of nitrogen the flask is charged via syringe with cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (6.0 g, 59.9 mmol, (Note 2)), 60 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2), and N-methylmorpholine (6.6 mL, 59.9 mmol, (Note 2)). Stirring is commenced, and the solution is cooled to an internal temperature of \u221215\u00b0C using a dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath at \u221220\u00b0 to \u221225\u00b0C. Ethyl chloroformate (5.7 mL, 59.9 mmol; (Note 2) and (Note 3)) is added and the solution is stirred for 5 min. The addition of ethyl chloroformate results in an internal temperature rise to +8 to +10\u00b0C and the precipitation of a white solid. Following the precipitation the continuously stirred mixture, still in the dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath, is allowed to reach an internal temperature of \u221214\u00b0C. Anhydrous ammonia (Note 2), introduced into the flask via a syringe needle, is vigorously bubbled through the solution for 10 min with manual stirring; the internal temperature rises abruptly to 25\u00b0C. With the flask still in the cooling bath, stirring is continued for an additional 30 min, and the reaction mixture is stored in the freezer at \u221215\u00b0C overnight (Note 4).\nThe slurry is stirred with tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at room temperature for 5 min and ammonium salts are removed by suction filtration through a B\u00fcchner funnel. After the solids are rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (20 mL), the filtrate is passed through a plug of silica gel (65 g Merck 60 230-400 mesh) in a coarse porosity sintered-glass filter funnel with aspirator suction. The funnel is further washed with acetonitrile (750 mL) and the combined filtrates are evaporated (rotary evaporator) to give a white solid. This material is recrystallized by heating (steam bath) with 8 : 1 ether : ethanol (70 mL); if necessary, ethanol is added dropwise to obtain a homogeneous solution. Cooling to room temperature results in white flakes that are collected by filtration (ether wash), 2.93 g. Two more crops (1.3 g total) are obtained by repeating the process for a total of 4.23 g (71%), mp 152\u2013153\u00b0C (lit.2 155\u00b0C). In several similar runs, the yield of amide was 4.23\u20134.49 g (71\u201376%).\nB. Cyclobutylamine hydrochloride. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and covered with aluminum foil. To the flask is added a solution of [I,I-bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (16.13 g, 37.5 mmol; (Note 5)) in 37.5 mL of acetonitrile, and the resulting solution is diluted with 37.5 mL of distilled deionized water. Cyclobutanecarboxamide (2.48 g, 25 mmol) is added; the amide quickly dissolves. Stirring is continued for 4 hr, and the acetonitrile is removed with a rotary evaporator. The aqueous layer is stirred with 250 mL of diethyl ether; to the stirring mixture is added 50 mL of concd hydrochloric acid (Note 6). The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 125-mL portions of ether. The organic fractions are combined and extracted with 75 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid. The aqueous fractions are combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator using a vacuum pump. Benzene (50 mL, (Note 2)) is added to the residue and the solution is concentrated with the rotary evaporator, again using a vacuum pump. Addition of benzene and concentration is repeated five more times. The crude solid is dried under reduced pressure over sulfuric acid overnight. To the product is added 5 mL of absolute ethanol and 35 mL of anhydrous ether, and the solution is heated at reflux on a steam bath. Ethanol is added slowly to the mixture, with swirling, until all the material is dissolved; the solution is cooled to room temperature. Anhydrous ether is added slowly until crystallization just begins. The flask is placed in the freezer and the product is allowed to crystallize. Filtration of the product and drying overnight under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide yields 1.86\u20132.06 g of cyclobutylamine hydrochloride (69\u201377%), mp 183\u2013185\u00b0C (lit.3 4 183\u2013184\u00b0C)."

Ethyl thioamidooxalate.3 A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar. Ethyl cyanoformate (20 g, 0.20 mol, (Note 1)) in benzene (25 mL) is added to the reaction vessel and the mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath. Diethylamine ((Note 2), 0.4 g, 5.5 mmol, 0.57 mL) is added to the stirring reaction mixture (0\u00b0C) and hydrogen sulfide (Note 3) is then bubbled into the reaction for an additional 15\u201320 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 25\u00b0C (14\u201316 hr). The crude product is collected by filtration (Note 4) and washed with benzene (2 \u00d7 3 mL) to give 20.96 g (78%) of pure ethyl thioamidooxalate. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product subjected to chromatography on silica gel (30% ether\u2013hexane eluant) to give an additional 1.57 g of ethyl thioamidooxalate. The total amount of ethyl thioamidooxalate isolated as a bright-yellow solid is 22.53 g (84%); mp 63\u201366\u00b0C (Note 5).\nB. Ethyl oxalamidrazonate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a 125-mL addition funnel. A solution of anhydrous hydrazine (4.8 g, 0.15 mol) in ethanol (75 mL) is added dropwise (10 min) to a stirred solution of ethyl thioamidooxalate (20.0 g, 0.15 mol) in ethanol (450 mL) at 25\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C (3.0 hr). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the reddish-orange solid is triturated with ethanol (350 mL).

In a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-mL dropping funnel, and a two-necked adapter fitted with a thermometer and a reflux condenser (Note 1), 89.1 g (1 mol) of (S)-alanine (Note 2) is dissolved in 1300 mL of 5 N hydrochloric acid (Note 3). The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice/sodium chloride bath (Note 4) and a precooled solution of 110 g (1.6 mol) of sodium nitrite in 400 mL of water is added dropwise at a rate of about 2 mL/min under vigorous stirring and efficient cooling so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 5\u00b0C. After 5 hr, the bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature (Note 5). The reflux condenser is connected with a water aspirator and the flask is carefully evacuated with stirring for 3 hr to remove nitrogen oxides, whereupon the color changes from yellowish brown to pale yellow. While the mixture is stirred vigorously, 100 g of solid sodium carbonate is added carefully in small portions so as to prevent excessive foaming. The reaction mixture is extracted with four portions of 400 mL of diethyl ether. The combined ether layers are concentrated to ca. 300 mL using a rotary evaporator at atmospheric pressure. The solution is washed with 50 mL of saturated brine, which thereafter is reextracted with three portions of 100 mL of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried for 10 hr over calcium chloride. The ether is distilled off with a rotary evaporator at atmospheric pressure (bath temperature 40\u201350\u00b0C). The oily residue is transferred into a distillation flask (rinsing the remainder with small portions of ether) and then fractionally distilled at reduced pressure, the main fraction boiling within a range of 2\u20133\u00b0C (i.e., bp 75\u201377\u00b0C at 10 mm) (Note 6) to give 63\u201371 g (58\u201365%) of an oil. The colorless oil is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 7) and (Note 8). On prolonged standing in a refrigerator, the oil tends to solidify partially or totally, but the white crystals formed have no sharp melting point. This procedure can be employed for other \u03b1-amino acids (see Table I and the Discussion)."

A 50-mL, narrow-necked vessel (A) is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a small Claisen stillhead (B), fitted with a thermometer and connected to a small receiver adapter with vacuum connection (C). A 25-mL or 50-mL flask (D) serves as a trap for the oxirane. To prevent clogging of the inlet pipe (E) by solidified reaction product, an appropriate flask (D) is chosen so that the distance between the inlet pipe (E) and the flask (D) is approximately 5\u201310 mm. The vacuum end of the adapter (C) is connected via a stopcock (F), a T-piece carrying a needle valve (G), and a manometer (H) to a water aspirator (I). The reaction vessel (A) is equipped with an ice bath, a thermometer, and a combined heater and magnetic stirrer that is placed on a jack. After the entire apparatus is connected (F closed), the trap (D) is air-cooled in a Dewar (K) that is partially filled with liquid nitrogen and heat-insulated at the top with cotton. A low-temperature thermometer (L) is placed at the same height near trap (D). The temperature of the trap (D) is controlled by moving the jack to the appropriate height to approximately \u221280\u00b0C. The pressure is adjusted by a needle valve (G) to 100 mm (F remains closed). A solution of 12.3 g (0.22 mol) of potassium hydroxide pellets in 12 mL of water is placed in the vessel (A) and cooled to 0\u00b0C. Neat (S)-2-chloropropan-1-ol, 11.8 g (0.125 mol), is poured at once into the alkaline solution (Note 10), and the reaction vessel is immediately fitted with a stillhead (B) and stirred vigorously with efficient cooling. The stopcock (F) is opened occasionally for a short period until the pressure in the closed system is reduced to 100 mm (Note 11). The ice bath is replaced by a water bath at 20\u00b0C. As the cyclization reaction proceeds, a white precipitate of potassium chloride is formed. After 10 min, the bath temperature is raised slowly to 30\u00b0C. Gentle boiling of the oxirane is maintained by cautiously opening the stopcock (F) from time to time, with attention paid to the reaction vessel. After a total reaction time of 40 min (Note 12), air is allowed to enter the closed system at the top of the stillhead, and the trap (D) is allowed to warm (Note 13) until two liquid phases are formed. The lower phase containing water is transferred via a Pasteur pipette into a small flask (Note 14). The flask (D) containing 5.9 g (81%) of crude (R)-methyloxirane is used in position (A) of the clean, dry apparatus (see Fig. 1) for redistillation of the oxirane from calcium hydride. At atmospheric pressure (stopcock F open), flask (A) is cooled to 0\u00b0C, whereas the trap (D) is kept at room temperature. Calcium hydride is added in small portions over a period of 1\u20132 hr until evolution of hydrogen ceases. The stopcock (F) is closed, the trap (D) is cooled, and the oxirane is distilled as described. Reduced pressure is applied with great care to avoid too vigorous boiling; 4.7\u20135.0 g (65\u201370%) of anhydrous oxirane is obtained as a clear liquid. This procedure can be employed for other oxiranes with slight modifications (see (Note 12) and (Note 14) and Table II).\nFigure 1. Apparatus for the preparation of (R)-methyloxirane."

            "A. Diethyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylethene-1,1-dicarboxylate. A 1-L, two-necked flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel is charged with 166 g (0.73 mol) of diethyl cyclopropylcarbonylmalonate (Note 1) and 0.5 kg of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 2). The flask is cooled with a water bath, stirring is started and 135 g (0.73 mol) of tributylamine (Note 3) is added from the dropping funnel. The reaction is exothermic. When the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is replaced by a glass stopper and the water bath is replaced by an oil bath. The mixture is heated at 110\u00b0C with stirring for 5\u20136 hr.\nExcess phosphorus oxychloride is removed as well as possible with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The residue is cooled to room temperature and 300 mL of diethyl ether is added. The mixture is poured into a separatory funnel. Hexane is added until the two phases separate cleanly and the funnel is shaken vigorously. The phases are separated and the lower layer is extracted with three 250-mL portions of ether (Note 4). The combined organic layers are washed with 300 mL of cold aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid and 200 mL of aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide (Note 5) and then concentrated carefully with a rotary evaporator to give 136\u2013156 g (70\u201387%) of crude diethyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylethene-1,1-dicarboxylate.2\nB. The crude chloromalonate is dissolved in 100 mL of 95% ethanol and transferred to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. Stirring is begun and a solution of potassium hydroxide in 350 mL of 95% ethanol (0.0035 mol of potassium hydroxide per gram of chloromalonate) (Note 6) is added dropwise from an additional funnel. A slightly exothermic reaction is noted. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 3 hr (or until the mixture is neutral to litmus; (Note 7)). Excess ethanol is removed with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in 300 mL of water and extracted with 350 mL of ether (Note 8). The phases are separated and some ice is added to the aqueous phase. The cooled aqueous phase is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with three 300-mL portions of ether. The ether phase is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to give 72\u201394 g (70\u201380%) of crude monoester.\nC. Ethyl cyclopropylpropiolate. The crude product is transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. A solution of 0.70 mL of triethylamine (Note 9) per gram of crude monoester from Part B in about 200 mL of toluene is added. The mixture is heated using an oil bath at 90\u00b0C with stirring until the evolution of carbon dioxide has subsided, and is then heated for another hour (Note 10). The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and washed with 300 mL of aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (Note 11) and finally with 300 mL of aqueous 5% sodium carbonate. The organic layer is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Fractional distillation of the residue gives the product, 87\u201395\u00b0C at 10 mm. The yield of the final step is 30\u201346 g (66\u201378%); the overall yield is 33\u201354% (Note 12)."

The flask is charged with 17.0 g (0.15 mol) of cyclohexanone oxime (Note 1) and flushed with argon, after which 300 mL of dichloromethane followed by 25 mL (0.18 mol) of triethylamine (Note 2) are injected through the septum into the flask. The solution is stirred and cooled to a temperature of \u221215 to \u221220\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013carbon tetrachloride bath, while 12.8 mL (0.165 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride is added over a 20-min period (Note 3) and (Note 4). The resulting mixture is stirred at this temperature for 15 min, and poured into 300 mL of ice water in a 1-L separatory funnel with the aid of three 30-mL portions of dichloromethane to rinse the flask. The lower organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with a 50-mL portion of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed successively with 250 mL of cold aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid, 250 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate, and 250 mL of brine, and are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at room temperature to give 27.2\u201328.8 g of crude solid cyclohexanone oxime methanesulfonate (Note 5). This material is used in Part B without purification (Note 6).\nB. 2-Propyl-1-azacycloheptane. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a variable-speed mechanical stirrer, 300-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a gas inlet at its top, and a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with argon, after which 243 mL of hexane (Note 7) and 57 mL (0.3 mol) of tripropylaluminum (Note 8) are injected through the septum into the flask. The solution is stirred and cooled to a temperature of \u221273 to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013methanol bath. The crude cyclohexanone oxime methanesulfonate prepared in Part A is dissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane, transferred to the dropping funnel, and added to a 1 M solution of tripropylaluminum in hexane over a 30-min period (Note 9). The mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C and stirred for 1 hr, and 225 mL (0.225 mol) of 1 M solution of diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexane (Note 10) is added at 0\u00b0C and the mixture is further stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr (Note 11).

            "A. 6-Chloromethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxen-4-one. A three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a rubber septum, and a 125-mL dropping funnel. The flask is flame-dried, flushed with nitrogen and charged with diisopropylamine (22.0 mL, 0.16 mol) and 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1). This solution is cooled in an ice bath, and the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of butyllithium (80.0 mL of a 1.88 M solution in hexane, 0.15 mol), which is added dropwise over 15 min (Note 2). The resulting solution is cooled to approximately \u221275\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and treated with a solution of 2,2,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxen-4-one2 (16.0 g, 0.11 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) dropwise over 20 min (Note 3). During the addition, a fine yellow suspension forms. The enolate solution is stirred at \u221275\u00b0C for an additional 15 min and then transferred via cannula to a 1-L flask containing hexachloroethane3 4; 5 (39.0 g, 0.16 mol) (Note 4) in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) at \u221250 to \u221255\u00b0C (dry ice\u2013acetone bath) over 30 min. When the addition is complete, any residual enolate is transferred with an additional portion of tetrahydrofuran (20 mL). The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to \u221225\u00b0C over 30 min and poured into ice-cold aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (200 mL), and the mixture is briefly shaken to discharge the red color. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 31.50\u201335.50 g of an oily solid. Column chromatography on Florisil (100\u2013200 mesh, 400 g) (Note 5) and elution with hexane (1 L) and 20% ethyl acetate\u2013hexane (2 L), gives 12.17\u201312.67 g (63\u201365%) of the desired product as a yellow oil (Note 6),(Note 7),(Note 8).\nB. 6-Diethylphosphonomethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxen-4-one. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is outfitted as above, flushed with nitrogen, and charged with potassium tert-butoxide (21.0 g, 0.187 mol) and dimethylformamide (200 mL) (Note 9). The stirring mixture is cooled in an ice bath and treated with diethyl phosphite (26.7 g, 0.193 mol). The resulting solution is stirred in the ice bath for 20\u201340 min and then treated dropwise with a solution of 6-chloromethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxen-4-one (11.00 g, 0.062 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) over 20 min. The resulting purple solution is stirred for an additional 15 min at 0\u00b0C and treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid dropwise until the purple color is discharged (ca. 6 mL). The resulting mixture is filtered by suction through Celite (Note 10), and the collected solids are washed with tetrahydrofuran (50 mL). The combined organic portions are treated with several grams of anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the tetrahydrofuran is removed with a rotary evaporator. Dimethylformamide and excess diethyl phosphite are removed by distillation at 0.4 mm with the bath temperature maintained below 50\u00b0C (Note 11). The residue is diluted with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and placed in the refrigerator at 0\u00b0C overnight. The solid that precipitates is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to ca. 75 mL and purified by flash chromatography (Note 12) and (Note 13) on 700 g of Florisil (9 \u00d7 22-cm column). Elution with 3 L of 1 : 1 ethyl acetate\u2013hexane, 3 L of 3 : 1 ethyl acetate\u2013hexane, and then 3 L of 100% ethyl acetate affords 8.30\u20138.56 g (48\u201350%) of 6-diethylphosphonomethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxen-4-one (Note 14) and (Note 15). Mixed fractions may be rechromatographed to afford an additional 2\u20134% of product."

A 3-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1), Dean\u2013Stark water separator (Note 2), a double-walled condenser attached to an argon gas inlet, and outlet needle connectors through a mineral oil bubbler. Into the flask are placed 150 g of Linde 5A powdered molecular sieves (Note 3), 2.0 g of Amberlyst 15 ion-exchange resin (Note 4), 157 g of benzenesulfonamide (Note 5), 1650 mL of dry toluene, and 107.5 g (1.014 mol) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde (Note 5). The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux under an argon atmosphere. Water that separates during the reaction is periodically removed and refluxing is continued until water separation ceases (ca. 16 hr). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature without stirring and the insoluble materials are filtered through a 500-mL-capacity sintered-glass funnel of medium porosity. The residue in the filter funnel is washed thoroughly with another 700 mL of toluene in three portions. The collected filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give a thick, yellow, oily residue that usually solidifies on standing. The residue is triturated with 800 mL of distilled pentane and the solid is broken into a powder with the aid of a flat-ended glass rod. The solid is separated by filtration through a 500-mL sintered-glass funnel of medium porosity, washed with distilled pentane (2 \u00d7 100 mL), and air-dried. The yield is 212 g (87%); mp 76\u201380\u00b0C (Note 6).\nAlthough of sufficient purity for the next step, the sulfonimine can be further purified by recrystallization. In a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 mL of ethyl acetate is dissolved, with warming, 212 g of the crude sulfonimine. After the mixture is cooled to room temperature, about 400 mL of pentane is added and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2\u20133 hr. The colorless crystalline product is collected by filtration, washed with 100 mL of pentane, and air-dried to give 191.5 g (78%), mp 78\u201380\u00b0C. The washings and filtrate are combined and the volume reduced by about one-third using a rotary evaporator. A second crop of crystals, 20.2 g (8%), mp 75\u201379\u00b0C, was obtained on standing for several hours.\nB. (\u00b1)-trans-2-(Phenylsulfonyl)-3-phenyloxaziridine. (See (Note 7).) A 5-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel. Into the flask are placed 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, 12.5 g (0.055 mol) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTEAC), and 122.5 g (0.50 mol) of N-benzylidenebenzenesulfonamide dissolved in 380 mL of chloroform (Note 8). The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at 0\u20135\u00b0C in an ice bath while a solution of 111.6 g (0.55 mol) of 85% m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) dissolved in 1000 mL of chloroform is added dropwise. After the addition of the peracid, which takes about 1 hr, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour at this temperature. A 3-L separatory funnel is used to separate the chloroform solution and wash it successively with 600 mL of cold water, 600 mL of aqueous 10% sodium sulfite, water (2 \u00d7 600 mL) and 250 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution (Note 9). After the chloroform solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate for 2 hr (Note 10), it is filtered and solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, keeping the water-bath temperature below 40\u00b0C. The resulting white solid residue is washed with a small portion of pentane, dissolved in a minimum of ethyl acetate (about 700\u2013800 mL) without heating, and filtered through fluted filter paper; 400 mL of pentane is added to the filtrate. After the white crystalline oxaziridine is cooled in the refrigerator overnight, it is separated by filtration, transferred to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask, washed with 200 mL of pentane, filtered, and air-dried for 1 hr. The yield is 83.5 g; mp 92\u201394\u00b0C. The mother liquor is reduced to about 300 mL and cooled in the refrigerator to give 36.6 g of a light-yellow solid; mp 87\u201390\u00b0C. This second crop is placed in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and triturated with 50 mL of anhydrous ether followed by the addition of 60 mL of pentane. The oxaziridine is isolated by filtration to give 31.1 g; mp 94\u201395\u00b0C (dec) (Note 11) and (Note 12). The combined yield is 114.6 g (88%).\nThe 2-sulfonyloxaziridine can be stored in a brown bottle in the refrigerator. Storage at room temperature is potentially hazardous (Note 13)."

            "A. Geranyl chloride. To a flame-dried, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a low-temperature thermometer, a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet adapter is added 1.47 g (11 mmol) of N-chlorosuccinimide (Note 1). The powder is dissolved in 45 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 2), and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221230\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013acetonitrile bath. Freshly distilled dimethyl sulfide (0.87 mL, 0.74 g, 12 mmol) is added dropwise by syringe. The mixture is warmed to 0\u00b0C with an ice\u2013water bath, maintained at that temperature for 5 min, and cooled to \u221240\u00b0C. To the resulting milky white suspension is added dropwise by syringe 1.54 g (10 mmol) of geraniol (Note 3) dissolved in 5 mL of dry dichloromethane. The suspension is warmed to 0\u00b0C with an ice\u2013water bath and stirred for 2 hr. The ice bath is then removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Stirring is continued for an additional 15 min. The resulting clear, colorless solution is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and washed with 25 mL of saturated sodium chloride. The aqueous layer is washed with two 20-mL portions of pentane. The pentane extracts and an additional 20-mL portion of pentane is added to the methylene chloride extract. The resulting solution is washed twice with 10 mL of saturated sodium chloride and dried over magnesium sulfate. Solid material is removed by vacuum filtration through a fritted-glass funnel, and most of the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at aspiratory pressure. The last traces of solvent are removed by pumping at high vacuum (0.2 mm) for 1.5 hr. The resulting pale-yellow oil (1.61 g, 9.3 mmol, 93%) is used directly in the next step (Note 4).\nB. Trisammonium geranyl diphosphate. To a flame-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a nitrogen inlet adapter is added 9.14 g (9.3 mmol) of tris(tetrabutylammonium) hydrogen pyrophosphate trihydrate (Note 5). The flocculent white solid is dissolved in 20 mL of dry acetonitrile (Note 6). To the resulting milky-white suspension (Note 7) is added 0.83 g (4.8 mmol) of geranyl chloride. The mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 hr. solvent is then removed with a rotary evaporator using a 40\u00b0C water bath. The pale-yellow residue is dissolved in 3 mL of ion-exchange buffer (Note 8), and the resulting clear solution is loaded onto a 4 \u00d7 15-cm column of Dowex AG 50W-X8 (100\u2013200-mesh) cation-exchange resin (ammonium form) (Note 9). The flask is washed twice with 5 mL of buffer and both washes are loaded into the column before elution with 360 mL (two column volumes) of ion-exchange buffer (Note 10). The eluant is collected in a 500-mL freeze-drying flask, frozen as described in Note 5, and lyophilized for 18\u201324 hr (Note 11) to yield 2.57 g of a white solid. The material is dissolved in 5 mL of 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate, and the clear solution is transferred to a 50-mL centrifuge tube. Then 20 mL of 1 : 1 (v/v) acetonitrile : isopropyl alcohol is added, and the contents are mixed thoroughly on a vortex mixer, during which time a white precipitate forms. The suspension is cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant solution is removed with a pipette, and residue is suspended in 5 mL of 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate, and the process is repeated. Three additional extractions are performed using 2 mL of 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate and 8 mL of acetonitrile : isopropyl alcohol. The combined supernatant solutions (approximately 80 mL) are concentrated to approximately 5 mL with a rotary evaporator at 40\u00b0C (Note 12).\nOne-half of the concentrated extract, dissolved in an equal volume of chromatography buffer (Note 13), is loaded onto a 5.5 \u00d7 18-cm cellulose flash column2 (Note 14). The flask is rinsed with three 5-mL portions of chromatography buffer and each is loaded onto the column. The column is then eluted with 900 mL of chromatography buffer. After a 50-mL forerun, twenty-eight 30-mL fractions are collected, and every second fraction is analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Note 15). Fractions containing trisammonium geranyl diphosphate (typically 12\u201323) are pooled and concentrated to approximately 120 mL with a rotary evaporator at 40\u00b0C. The concentrate is transferred to a 250-mL freeze-drying flask and lyophilized for 18\u201324 hr as previously described in (Note 5). The resulting flocculent white solid is collected and stored at \u221278\u00b0C. The cellulose chromatography is repeated to yield a total of 1.51\u20131.55 g (85\u201387%) of trisammonium geranyl diphosphate from geraniol (Note 16)."

            "A. Ethyl \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)acrylate. (See (Note 1)). A 1000-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with mechanical stirrer, 250-mL equalizing funnel, condenser, and thermometer. Paraformaldehyde (48 g, 1.6 mol), 1 N phosphoric acid (4 mL), and water (110 mL) are heated at 90\u00b0C for 1.5 hr to form a clear aqueous formaldehyde solution. This solution is cooled to room temperature. Triethyl phosphonoacetate (89.6 g, 0.4 mol) is added to the flask and the solution is stirred at room temperature at 1000 rpm. A solution of potassium carbonate (60.7 g, 0.44 mol) in water (60 mL) is added at room temperature (first slowly: 10 mL in 10 min) and then more rapidly (40 min). The temperature reaches 35\u201340\u00b0C and must be maintained at this level (with a water bath if necessary). Stirring is continued for 5 min at 40\u00b0C after the end of the addition; then the mixture (liquid\u2013liquid heterogenous mixture) must be cooled rapidly to room temperature using an ice bath (Note 2) while diethyl ether (200 mL) and brine (150 mL) are added. After decantation, the mixture is extracted with ether (three 100-mL portions). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (two 100-mL portions) (Note 3) and dried over magnesium sulfate; the solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure and the remaining oil is distilled to give a fraction at 65\u201370\u00b0C (1 mm) that weighs 38.5\u201341.6 g (74\u201380%), nD20 1.4494. The hydroxy ester is of high purity as shown by GLC analysis (25-m silica capillary OV-1 column) and spectral data (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

            "A. (\u00b1)-Binaphthylphosphoric (BNP) acid. A 1-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser topped by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer, is charged with 450 mL of pyridine and, while stirring, with 100 g (0.35 mol) of (\u00b1)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (Note 1).\nTo this stirred suspension, 73.6 g (0.48 mol) of freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride is added dropwise, whereupon the temperature rises to about 80\u00b0C, most of the binaphthol dissolves, and pyridine hydrochloride crystals form. Complete dissolution is achieved by heating to 90\u00b0C. The stirred solution is allowed to cool to 50\u201360\u00b0C. (Crystallization occurs at about 85\u00b0C.) To the stirred suspension, 40 mL of water is added dropwise (Caution! Exothermic reaction!), which raises the temperature to the boiling point (ca. 118\u00b0C). The resulting solution, cooled to about 60\u00b0C, is transferred to a l-L dropping funnel and the flask is rinsed with pyridine (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The solution and rinse are combined and added dropwise with vigorous stirring to 900 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid (Note 2), which gives a precipitate of pyridine-solvated binaphthylphosphoric (BNP) acid (Note 3). This crude product is collected by suction filtration. The wet cake is transferred to a 2-L, large-necked flask and stirred with 300 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The suspension is heated to boiling (possible foaming!) and immediately cooled. The solid is thoroughly filtered by suction, washed twice with 20 mL of water (Note 4), and air-dried to afford 114\u2013119 g (94\u201399%) of (\u00b1)-binaphthylphosphoric acid. This compound, which decomposes without melting at about 300\u00b0C (Note 5), is pure enough to be resolved. Analytical crystalline samples can be obtained from ethanol.\nB. (S)-(+)- and (R)-(\u2212)-BNP acid. In a 2-L flask 95.2 g (0.27 mol) of racemic binaphthylphosphoric (BNP) acid and 80.4 g (0.27 mol) of (+)-cinchonine (Note 6) are dissolved in 985 mL of hot methanol (Note 7). To the hot (65\u00b0C) solution is added 420 mL of hot water via a dropping funnel over the course of 20 min. During the addition the solution is vigorously stirred and maintained at 65\u201370\u00b0C. At the end of the addition, the flask is transferred to another (cool) stirring plate. Crystallization starts at approximately 60\u00b0C, and stirring is maintained until the solution has reached room temperature (Note 8). The crystals are collected, washed with a 2 : 1 methanol\u2013water mixture (3 \u00d7 45 mL), and air-dried to afford 76.6 g of salt consisting of 91% p salt [(+)-acid, (+)-base] and 9% n salt [(\u2212)-acid, (+)-base], [\u03b1]54625 + 424\u00b0 (methanol, c 0.99) (Note 9) and (Note 10).\n(S)-(+)-BNP ACID. A 2-L, three-necked flask, equipped with addition funnel, reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and thermometer, is charged with 76.6 g of the above-mentioned salt and 500 mL of ethanol. The salt is dissolved by heating to reflux, and 570 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid is added with vigorous stirring over the course of 30 min. The temperature is maintained at 75\u201380\u00b0C during the addition, and the acid begins to precipitate. Once the addition is complete, the solution is allowed to cool without stirring to room temperature. The solid is collected, washed with water (5 \u00d7 90 mL), and air-dried to afford 26.7 g of (S)-(+)-BNP acid, [\u03b1]54625 + 712\u00b0 (methanol, c 0.98) (Note 11). The yield based on enantiomer present in the racemate is 56%. The product is free from contamination by cinchonine, as shown by 1H NMR (Me2SO, 250 MHz), and elemental analysis. HPLC analysis of the methyl ester derivative employing a chiral stationary phase (Note 12) shows the acid to be greater than 99.4% ee. Partially resolved samples, recovered by adding water to the filtrates, may be purified by crystallization from ethanol or by digestion in hot methanol (Note 13).\n(R)-(\u2212)-BNP ACID. The filtrate from the initial crystallization of the cinchonine salt is evaporated nearly to dryness to give 107 g of crude salt, [\u03b1]54625 \u2212113\u00b0 (methanol, c 0.95), consisting of approximately 81% n salt and 19% p salt (Note 14) and (Note 10). A 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with addition funnel, reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and thermometer is charged with 107 g of the crude salt and 700 mL of ethanol. The salt is dissolved by heating to reflux, and 790 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid is added with vigorous stirring over the course of 30 min. The temperature is maintained at 75\u201380\u00b0C during the addition, and the acid begins to precipitate. Once the addition is complete, the solution is allowed to cool without stirring to room temperature. The solid is collected, washed with water (5 \u00d7 100 mL), and air-dried to afford 23.3 g of (\u2212)-BNP acid, [\u03b1]54625 \u2212717\u00b0 (methanol, c 1.00) (Note 11). The yield based on enantiomer present in the racemate is 49%. The product is free from contamination by cinchonine, as shown by 1H NMR (Me2SO, 250 MHz) and elemental analysis.

The resulting pale-yellow oil is then treated cautiously in small portions with 10.4 g (123.8 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate. The addition causes gas evolution and foaming. Foaming subsides after ca. 20 min, and the resulting turbid yellow solution is stirred overnight at room temperature (Note 3).\nThe reaction mixture is poured into a mixture of 300 mL of toluene and 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The resulting milky solution is washed twice with 100-mL portions of deionized water and twice with 100-mL portions of brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure in a 50\u00b0C bath. The semisolid residue is slurried in 55 mL of ether and then collected by filtration on a sintered-glass funnel. After the solid is washed 4 times with 10 mL of ether, it is set aside and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The residue is slurried in 10 mL of ether. The solid is collected on a glass frit and washed twice with 10 mL of ether.

Crude (R)-(+)-1,1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diol.\n[Caution! Gases evolved in this step create a stench and are toxic. The use of an efficient fume hood is imperative (Note 5).]\nA 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with Y-tube, magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel topped with gas bubbler, thermometer, and drying tube is charged with 14.7 g (40.6 mmol) of crude (R)-(\u2212)-methyl 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl phosphate and 350 mL of dry toluene. The mixture is stirred under nitrogen and heated with a steam bath until dissolution occurs (44\u00b0C). The solution is then cooled in an ice\u2013water bath to 10\u00b0C. The cooling bath is removed and a solution of 27.0 mL (91.8 mmol) of Red-Al (Note 6) in 35 mL of toluene is added from the dropping funnel over a 90-min period. The mixture turns yellow, evolves a gas, and heats up to 26\u00b0C. Gas evolution ceases 20 min after the addition is completed. TLC analysis (silica gel plate developed with ethyl acetate) indicates that the reaction is complete.\nThe entire reaction mixture is poured into 430 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid (mild exothermic reaction). The organic layer is separated and washed with another 430-mL portion of 10% hydrochloric acid. After further washes with 150 mL of brine and 160 mL of deionized water, all aqueous layers are combined and back-extracted with a 550-mL portion of 3 : 2 toluene : methanol and two 300-mL portions of toluene. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered.

A 200-mL flask with a reflux condenser is charged with 11.4 g of crude (R)-(+)-1,1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diol and 1.5 g of Norit A, and refluxed for 5 min. The hot solution is filtered through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit. The Celite and Norit A from the frit are slurried together with 1.5 g of Norit A in 70 mL of toluene, refluxed for 5 min, and filtered hot through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit. The Celite is washed with 70 mL of hot toluene. The combined filtrates are warmed to 50\u00b0C to dissolve the precipitated crystals and filtered once again while warm through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit, which is then washed with 40 mL of hot toluene. The filtrate is freed from solvent on a rotary evaporator and the residue is recrystallized from 75 mL of toluene with stirring. The mixture is stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The resulting suspension is filtered and the filter cake is washed with two 10-mL portions of toluene. The recrystallized product is then dried under reduced pressure (high vacuum) to give 9.62 g of white, microcrystalline material in the first crop.

            "A. 2,2'-Dibromo-1,1'-binaphthyl. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 240 g (0.915 mol) of triphenylphosphine and 500 mL of dry acetonitrile (Note 1). Stirring is begun and the solid is dissolved by warming the flask with hot water. The solution is then cooled with an ice\u2013water mixture, and to this is added dropwise with stirring 155 g (50 mL, 0.969 mol) of bromine over a 1-hr period. The ice\u2013water bath is removed and 120 g (0.420 mol) of 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl is added to the solution (Note 2). The viscous slurry is stirred at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, and most of the solvent is removed by applying partial vacuum. The last trace of acetonitrile is removed at aspirator vacuum using a bath temperature of 100\u00b0C. The temperature of the resulting mass is raised carefully by means of a heating mantle (Note 3) to 240\u2013260\u00b0C over a period of 1 hr, at which temperature an exothermic reaction occurs (Note 4), with evolution of hydrogen bromide. After the exothermic reaction subsides, the reaction mixture is further stirred at 260\u2013270\u00b0C for 1 hr, and then the temperature is gradually raised and kept at 310\u2013320\u00b0C for 30 min to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture, a homogenous melt, is allowed to cool to ca. 200\u00b0C with stirring and to this is added 1000 mL of Celite with stirring (Note 5). After the mixture is cooled below 70\u00b0C, it is extracted with 500 mL of a boiling 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and hexane. The solid material, separated by filtration through a sintered-glass funnel, is extracted further with three 200-mL portions of a boiling 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and hexane. The combined extracts are evaporated to give an orange-yellow viscous oil, which is dissolved in 200 mL of ethanol. The solution is left in a refrigerator for 2 days (Note 6). 2,2'-Dibromo-1,1'-binaphthyl precipitates and is collected on a sintered-glass funnel to give 90 g of the crude product. Recrystallization from ethanol affords the pure dibromide (78.0 g, 45% yield) as pale-yellow, fine crystals (Note 7).\nB. (\u00b1)-2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphinyl)-1,1'-binaphthyl [(\u00b1)-BINAPO]. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is provided with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser, the top of which is connected with a bubbler and an argon line by way of a three-way stopcock. The flask is flushed with argon and charged with 2.84 g (0.117 g-atom) of magnesium turnings, 50 mL of dry, degassed tetrahydrofuran (Note 8), 50 mg of iodine, and 0.5 mL of 1,2-dibromoethane. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until the color of iodine fades and evolution of ethylene ceases. The flask is placed in an oil bath, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated at 50\u201370\u00b0C, and 20.0 g (50.0 mmol) of 2,2'-dibromo-1,1'-binaphthyl in 400 mL of dry, degassed toluene (Note 9) is added over a period of 3.5 hr. The mixture is stirred at 75\u00b0C for 2 hr and then cooled to 10\u00b0C. To this is added dropwise over a 20-min period a solution of 28.4 g (120 mmol) of diphenylphosphinyl chloride (Note 10) in 35 mL of toluene (Note 9) while the temperature is held at 10\u201315\u00b0C. After the addition is completed, the mixture is further stirred at 60\u00b0C for 2 hr, and then cooled to 15\u00b0C. To the solution is added dropwise 350 mL of 10% aqueous ammonium chloride and the mixture is stirred for another 10 min at 60\u00b0C. The organic layer is separated, washed successively with 150 mL of 10% aqueous ammonium chloride, two 150-mL portions of 1 N sodium hydroxide, and finally with two 150-mL portions of water. The toluene layer is dried for a short time over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 11), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 38.8 g of a pale-yellow solid. This crude product is stirred with 150 mL of boiling toluene for a few minutes, and to this is added 100 mL of heptane. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The solid product is separated by filtration through a sintered-glass funnel and dried at 70\u00b0C (0.05 mm) for 2 hr to give 24.5 g (75%) of (\u00b1)-BINAPO as a slightly-pale-yellow solid (Note 12). Concentration of the filtrate and recrystallization of the residue twice from 30-mL portions of toluene gives an additional 3.6 g (11%) of (\u00b1)-BINAPO. This product is suitable for use in Part C without further purification.\nC. Optical resolution of (\u00b1)-BINAPO. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 10.5 g (16.0 mmol) of racemic BINAPO and 700 mL of chloroform (Note 13). The solid is dissolved by heating at reflux temperature with stirring, followed by rapid addition of a warm solution of 6.0 g (16.0 mmol) of (\u2212)-2,3-O-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid monohydrate [(\u2212)-DBT monohydrate] (Note 14) in 460 mL of ethyl acetate (Note 13). The mixture is stirred under reflux for 2\u20133 min and then allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The crystals formed are collected on a sintered-glass funnel and the filtrate is stored for recovery of (R)-(+)-BINAPO (see below). The solid product is dried at room temperature (0.05 mm) for 6 hr to give 7.2 g (89% of theory) of a 1 : 1 complex of (S)-BINAPO and (\u2212)-DBT, mp 238\u2013240\u00b0C (dec), [\u03b1]D25 \u2212170\u00b0 (ethanol, c 0.503) (Note 15).\nThis complex (7.1 g, 7.0 mmol) is treated with 150 mL of 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and the mixture is extracted with two 150-mL portions of chloroform.

In a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask 10.0 g (51.7 mmol) of 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 1 (Note 1) is combined with 11.5 g (53.7 mmol) of (S)-N,N-dimethyl-N'-(1-tert-butoxy-3-methyl)-2-butylformamidine (Note 2), 50 mL of dry toluene, and 50 mg of (+)-camphorsulfonic acid (Note 3). The mixture is heated to reflux for 24 hr and allowed to cool to room temperature. Approximately 30 mL of toluene is removed by rotary evaporation and the residual solution is heated at reflux for an additional 2 days. After the reaction mixture is cooled, it is diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide and 100 mL of brine and the organic layer is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is distilled (Kugelrohr 0.1 mm, 170\u00b0C bath temp.) to give 18.0 g (96%) of 2 as a pale-yellow oil (Note 4).\nB. (S)-6,7-Dimethoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, (\u2212)-salsolidine (3). A 500-mL, three-necked flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is equipped with a three-way stopcock, a low-temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 15.0 g (41.4 mmol) of formamidine 2, filled with argon, and kept under a pressure of ca. 100 mm against the atmosphere (Note 5). Through the septum, via a syringe, is added 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 6) and the solution is cooled to \u221275\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. A tert-butyllithium solution (21 mL of a 2.4 M solution, (Note 7)), is added dropwise within 5 min through the septum. After the deep-red solution is stirred at \u221275\u00b0C for 45 min, is cooled to \u2212100\u00b0C in a liquid nitrogen\u2013methanol bath and, after 15 min at \u2212100\u00b0C, 3 mL of freshly distilled iodomethane (Note 8) dissolved in 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added by syringe at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above \u221290\u00b0C. Stirring is continued for 3 hr and the solution is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 50 mL of water. This is extracted twice with 100 mL of dichloromethane and the combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of brine, dried over potassium carbonate, and filtered. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a cloudy yellow oil, which is dissolved in 100 mL of 60% ethanol. To this solution is added 4.5\u20135.0 mL of hydrazine (Note 9) followed by 3.0 mL of glacial acetic acid (pH 8\u20139). The mixture is stirred overnight at ambient temperature and diluted with 50 mL of water. It is extracted twice with 100 mL of dichloromethane, and the combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of water, dried (potassium carbonate), filtered, and concentrated at ambient temperature under aspirator pressure. The residue, which consists of valinol tert-butyl ether and salsolidine, is distilled bulb-to-bulb under aspirator pressure at 105\u00b0C (pot temperature). This removes the valinol tert-butyl ether (Note 10), leaving crude salsolidine as the pot residue. The residue is dissolved in 100 mL of ether and washed twice with 35-mL portions of ice water\u20133 N hydrochloric acid (1:4). The ether layer is discarded and the acidic aqueous layer is neutralized with cold (0\u20135\u00b0C) aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide until it is alkaline to pH paper. The creamy mixture is immediately extracted twice with 50 mL of dichloromethane and the organic layers are drawn off, combined, and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After the drying agent is removed by filtration, it is washed twice with 5 mL of dichloromethane. The filtrate and wash are concentrated by rotoevaporation, leaving a yellow oil. Distillation (Kugelrohr) at a pot temperature of 120\u2013125\u00b0C (0.01 mm) gives 5.1\u20135.3 g (60\u201363%) of (S)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (salsolidine) 3 as a pale-yellow oil, which crystallizes on standing (Note 11), mp 47\u201349\u00b0C, (Note 12) and (Note 13)."

The flask is charged with 20 g (0.2 mol) of succinic anhydride, 62.5 g (0.4 mol) of l-menthol, 250 mg (1.3 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 150 mL of toluene (Note 1). The mixture is heated under reflux in an oil bath (about 140\u00b0C) for 24 hr. During this period the theoretical amount of water (3.6 mL) is collected. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, diluted with 200 mL of hexane, and poured into a mixture of 250 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate, 100 mL of methanol, and 200 mL of water. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 100 mL of hexane. The organic phases are combined, washed once with 200 mL of saturated brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting crude product is dissolved in 100 mL of methanol. After the solution stands in a refrigerator overnight, colorless crystals appear in the mixture and are collected by filtration with suction (Note 2). This material (ca. 70 g in two crops) is purified by recrystallization from methanol to afford 66 g (84%) of pure (\u2212)-dimenthyl succinate, mp 63\u201364\u00b0C (Note 3).\nB.

The air in the system is replaced with dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 180 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and cooled with an ice bath; 74.1 mL of a 1.7 M hexane solution of butyllithium (126 mmol) (Note 4) is added. This solution is stirred while 21.3 mL (126 mmol) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (Note 5) is added dropwise with a syringe through the septum over a 10-min period. The resulting solution of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP) is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013methanol bath (Note 6) and stirred. A solution of 23.7 g (60 mmol) of (\u2212)-dimenthyl succinate in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is then added dropwise through the addition funnel over a 1-hr period. The wall of the funnel is rinsed with 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and the rinse is added to the solution. The resulting yellow solution of succinate dianion is stirred for 1 hr. To the solution is added dropwise 3.9 mL (60 mmol) of bromochloromethane (Note 7) with a syringe through the septum over a 10-min period. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr (Note 8), 2.2 mL (24 mmol) of isobutyraldehyde (Note 9) is added dropwise to quench any unreacted anions (Note 10). After being stirred for an additional 30 min, the reaction mixture is poured into 250 mL of ice-cooled 1 N hydrochloric acid and the product is extracted 3 times with 150 mL of ether.

After 10 min the lithium reagent is added dropwise to the flask over a 40-min period. After the addition is complete, the yellow solution is stirred for an additional 2 hr at \u221278\u00b0C during which time a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is flame-dried under nitrogen. The 1-L, flask, capped with a rubber septum, is charged with a solution of 5.8 g (0.053 mol) of ethyl chloroformate (Note 14) in 150 mL of tetrahydrofuran and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath.

After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir an additional 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C and then treated with 20 mL of methanol in one portion. After 10 min at \u221278\u00b0C the reaction mixture, while still cold, is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel containing 200 mL of water and 100 mL of hexane. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is washed with hexane (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give a dark-brown oil.

After an additional 10 min at room temperature a solution of 8.0 g (20.6 mmol) of ethyl (E)-3-(tributylstannyl)propenoate in 5 mL of chloroform is added to the flask by syringe. The stirring reaction mixture is heated to 50\u00b0C for 12 hr while a pressure of 1 atm of carbon monoxide is maintained (Note 26) and (Note 27). The reaction is cooled to room temperature and treated with 18 mL of a 1.2 M solution of pyridinium poly(hydrogen fluoride) (Note 28),(Note 29),(Note 30) along with 10 mL of pyridine. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature overnight and then transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel containing 75 mL of water. After addition of 30 mL of chloroform, the organic layer is washed successively with 10% hydrochloric acid (3 \u00d7 20 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 \u00d7 20 mL), water (25 mL), and brine (25 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give a dark-brown solid. The product is dissolved in chloroform and 15 g of silica gel (Note 16) is added to the solution. Concentration under reduced pressure gives a brown powder of silica coated with product, which is immediately placed on the top of a column of silica gel (50 g) (Note 16). Elution is carried out with ethyl acetate and the fractions are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (Note 31). The crude product is again placed on a column of silica gel (250 g). Elution is carried out with hexane/ethyl acetate (90 : 10). Fractions containing the product (obtained by collecting the bright yellow band on the column) are combined to give 3.42 g (80%) of ethyl (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-4-oxo-2-butenoate as yellow-green crystals, mp 69\u201371\u00b0C (Note 32)."

In a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 5-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a pressure-reducing outlet (Note 1) is placed 800 mL of pentane (Note 2). The flask is cooled with an ice bath and 5.4 g (0.1 mol) of butadiene is dissolved with stirring (0\u20135\u00b0C) by addition through one of the inlets from a Fluka low-pressure bottle of butadiene (Note 3). The pressure-reducing outlet is removed and a freshly prepared solution of 1.68 g (7.5 mmol) of palladium acetate, Pd(OAc)2, 8.4 g (0.2 mol) of lithium chloride, 20.4 g (0.2 mol) of lithium acetate dihydrate (LiOAc \u00b7 2H2O), and 21.6 g (0.2 mol) of p-benzoquinone in 400 mL of acetic acid is added (Note 4). The cooling bath is removed and the two-phase system is stirred at a moderate rate (Note 5) at 25\u00b0C for 26 hr. A saturated sodium chloride solution (300 mL) is added and after the mixture is stirred for 5 min; it is filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel with an intermediate paper filter using aspirator vacuum. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 300-mL portions of pentane\u2013ether (80 : 20). The combined organic phases are washed with two 75-mL portions of water, two 100-mL portions of saturated potassium carbonate solution, three 100-mL portions of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution, and finally with 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a volume of 20\u201330 mL by distilling off the solvent at atmospheric pressure. The remaining solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator vacuum to give 13\u201315 g of crude product, which is distilled (10 mm, 70\u201390\u00b0C) to yield 9.7\u201312.0 g (65\u201381%) of a light-yellow liquid consisting of 91% of 1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-butene (E/Z = 90/10) and 9% of 4-acetoxy-3-chloro-1-butene. The chloroacetate is contaminated with approximately 1% of 5,8-dihydronaphthoquinone (Note 6).\nFurther purification is achieved by the following procedure. The chloroacetate from above is dissolved in 150 mL of ether. This solution is stirred together with a 10-mL aqueous solution saturated with sodium borohydride. The stirring is continued until the yellow color of the organic phase disappears (ca. 15 min). The organic phase is separated and washed with 5 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution and 5 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distilling off the solvent at atmospheric pressure. The solvent that remains is removed with a rotary evaporator to afford 9.5\u201310.5 g (64\u201370%) of chloroacetate, with the same composition as above, but which is now completely free from 5,8-dihydronaphthoquinone (Note 7).\nB1. 1-Acetoxy-4-diethylamino-2-butene. Method 1. In a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and a rubber septum, is placed 2.77 g (2.4 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, Pd(PPh3)4 (Note 8). The flask is closed, evacuated, and filled with nitrogen. This flushing procedure is repeated twice (Note 9). A solution of 8.91 g (0.06 mol) of the chloroacetate from Procedure A in 180 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 10) is added through the membrane with the aid of a 50-mL syringe. With the same syringe 21.9 g (0.30 mol) of diethylamine (Note 11) in 120 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and the reaction is followed by gas chromatography. When the starting material has been consumed, which takes approximately 4 hr (Note 12), 600 mL of ice-cooled ether and 600 mL of ice-cooled saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution are added and the mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel (Note 13). The aqueous phase is extracted with ether ( 2 \u00d7 300 mL).\nThe combined organic phases are washed with 50 mL of saturated potassium carbonate solution and dried over solid potassium carbonate. Evaporation with a rotary evaporator affords 13.7 g of crude product. The residue is put on a column (silica, 3 \u00d7 10 cm) and eluted with 600 mL of ether\u2013pentane\u2013triethylamine (47.5 : 47.5 : 5) (Note 14). The main fractions are collected to give 8.15 g (73%) of essentially pure E-1-acetoxy-4-diethylamino-2-butene (>94% E). No 1,2-isomer could be detected. The product is further purified by Kugelrohr distillation to afford 7.81\u20138.21 g (70\u201374%) (Note 15).\nB2. 1-Acetoxy-4-benzylamino-2-butene. Method 2. In a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask are placed in order 8.91 g (0.06 mol) of the chloroacetate from Method A, 100 mL of acetonitrile, and 19.3 g (0.18 mol) of benzylamine (Note 6). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and the solution is refluxed for 2 hr using an oil bath at 100\u2013110\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is cooled and 150 mL of ether and 100 mL of a saturated sodium carbonate solution are added. The mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel and the organic phase is collected. The aqueous phase is extracted with 50 mL of ether. The combined organic phases are dried over potassium carbonate. The solvent and excess benzylamine are removed by rotary evaporation and Kugelrohr distillation at 50\u00b0C (1 mm). Kugelrohr distillation of the crude product gives 9.1\u20139.9 g (70\u201376%) of 1-acetoxy-4-benzylamino-2-butene as a 90 : 10 mixture of the E and Z isomers (Note 17)."

The system is flushed with nitrogen and flame-dried, and while the system is maintained under a static pressure of nitrogen, the flask is charged with 300 mL of dry dimethylformamide (Note 1) and 110.3 g (1.1 mol) of triethylamine (Note 2); 58.3 (0.54 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 3) is added by syringe. Cyclohexanone (40.0 g, 0.41 mol) (Note 4) is added and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for 48 hr. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the contents are poured into 600 mL of pentane. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with three 500-mL portions of cold aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer is washed rapidly in succession with 200 mL of cold 1.5N hydrochloric acid and 200 mL of cold aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The pentane solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation.

The flask is charged with 200 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 6) and 13.0 g (0.185 mol) of 3-butyn-2-ol (Note 7). After the mixture is stirred for 15 min, 65.0 g (0.19 mol) of dicobalt octacarbonyl (Note 8) is added in portions over a few minutes while maintaining a slow stream of nitrogen. Vigorous gas evolution (carbon monoxide!) is observed. The mixture is stirred for 4\u20135 hr, and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure (20\u201325 mm). The residual solid (alkyne)Co2(CO6) complex is dissolved in 40 mL of propionic anhydride under nitrogen and cooled to \u221245\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetonitrile bath.

After the addition of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (41.9 g, 0.22 mol), the resulting dark-brown mixture is shaken occasionally for 20 min at room temperature.\nA 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-mL addition funnel and a Teflon-coated stirring bar is flame-dried under a stream of dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (34.0 g, 0.20 mol) (Note 2) and dry dichloromethane (200 mL) (Note 1) and the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice\u2013water bath.\nThe p-toluenesulfonyl chloride\u2013aluminum chloride complex is quickly filtered through a glass wool plug (Note 3) into the addition funnel. The residue is washed rapidly with an additional 50 mL of dry dichloromethane and the funnel is quickly stoppered. The complex is added dropwise during 1 hr to the cold (0\u00b0C), magnetically stirred silylacetylene solution. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for an additional 12 hr. The mixture is hydrolyzed by pouring it into a slurry of 20% hydrochloric acid (200 mL) and ice (200 g) (Note 4). The organic layer is separated, washed twice with water (150 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent in a rotary evaporator gives a brown solid (Note 5) that is recrystallized from light petroleum ether (bp 40\u201360\u00b0C) to yield 39.7\u201340.4 g (79\u201380%) of p-tolyl 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl sulfone as white crystals, mp 81\u201382\u00b0C (Note 6).\nB.

After the mixture is stirred for 30 min, a clear solution is obtained. In the addition funnel is placed 350 mL of an aqueous solution containing potassium carbonate (6.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M) and potassium bicarbonate (6.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M); this buffer is added at a rate to maintain the reaction temperature at 30\u00b0C (Note 7) and (Note 8). The mixture is diluted with water (200 mL), and extracted with four 100-mL portions of chloroform. The combined organic phases are washed 3 times with water (100 mL) and twice with brine (100 mL) prior to drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure leaves a creamy white solid, which is purified by either recrystallization from ethyl acetate\u2013petroleum ether or silica gel chromatography using 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether as eluant (Note 9). There is obtained 15.0 g (83%) of colorless crystals, mp 74\u201375\u00b0C (Note 10) and (Note 11)."

The seleninic acid is stirred at 25\u00b0C as the hydrazide slurry is added over 1 hr (Note 2). After an additional hour at 25\u00b0C, the reaction mixture is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 250 mL of hot methanol and the solution of selenosulfonate is cooled overnight at ca. 5\u00b0C in a refrigerator to induce crystallization. The yellow product that precipitates is filtered and recrystallized from methanol to afford 24.3\u201325.2 g (83\u201385%) of phenyl benzeneselenosulfonate, mp 56\u00b0C (Note 3).\nB. 1-(Phenylsulfonyl)cyclopentene.

The flask is equipped with a Friedrichs condenser and the stirred reaction mixture is blanketed with nitrogen. Following irradiation with 150-W sunlamp at room temperature for 45 min, the solution is transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator.\nA Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is placed atop the residue, which is dissolved in 140 mL of dichloromethane. The stirred solution is cooled in an ice\u2013water bath to 0\u00b0C as 60 mL of 15% hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise via an addition funnel over 30 min (Note 5). Vigorous stirring is maintained at this temperature for 1.5 hr. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, diluted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate and washed twice with 150-mL portions of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and freed of solvent under reduced pressure. The residual yellowish solid is dissolved in a small amount of dichloromethane and eluted with 5% ethyl acetate in dichloromethane through a column of 80 g of neutral alumina (activity III) to afford 8.28\u20139.19 g (79\u201387%) of colorless crystals, mp 65\u201366\u00b0C. 1H NMR analysis shows this material to be of very high purity (Note 6)."

The stirred reaction mixture is blanketed with nitrogen and heated in an oil bath at 123\u2013125\u00b0C in the dark for 3 days. After the solution is cooled, it is diluted with 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 30 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid and heated at the reflux temperature for 24 hr. Most of the tetrahydrofuran is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and diluted with ether (200 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL). The organic phase is washed with two 50-mL volumes of half-saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and a mixed solution of saturated sodium bicarbonate (10 mL) and half-saturated sodium chloride (40 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The residue is subjected to flash column chromatography on silica gel (250 g). Elution with a mixture of ethyl acetate\u2013dichloromethane\u2013petroleum ether (1 : 25 : 25) returns 3.56 g (41%) of unreacted 1-(phenylsulfonyl)cyclopentene. Subsequent increase in the solvent polarity to 3 : 25 : 25 provides the cycloadduct as a yellowish solid. This material is dissolved in the minimum amount of dichloromethane to which is added 25 mL of ether; 4.33 g of colorless crystals precipitate. Concentration of the filtrate and crystallization from ether\u2013petroleum ether afford an additional 0.77\u20131.34 g of light-yellow crystals (combined yield of 44\u201349%) (Note 3).\nB.

Zinc powder (13.3 g, 0.203 mol) (Note 4) is introduced and the capped reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 hr. The zinc is removed by suction filtration through a Celite pad (B\u00fcchner funnel) and washed with 200 mL of ether. The combined filtrates are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, diluted with 300 mL of petroleum ether, and washed with 200 mL of water. The aqueous phase is reextracted with 300 mL of a 1 : 1 mixture of ether and petroleum ether. Finally the combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of water and 200 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution prior to drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtration. The solvents are removed on a rotary evaporator to leave a pale-yellow oil that is purified by chromatography on silica gel (elution with 14% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether).

Wet, 5% rhodium on carbon (1.1 g) (Note 1), tetrahydrofuran (200 ml) (Note 2), and nitrobenzene (41.0 g) (Note 3) are introduced into a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a condenser. The mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0C and hydrazine hydrate (17.0 g) (Note 4) is introduced into the reaction mixture from a pressure-equalized addition funnel over 30 min. The temperature of the mixture is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0C throughout the addition by means of an ice\u2013water bath. After the mixture is stirred for a further 2 hr at 25\u201330\u00b0C, the reaction is complete (Note 5). The mixture is filtered and the catalyst washed with a little tetrahydrofuran. The solution is used immediately in the acylation step (Note 6).\nB. N-Acetyl-N-phenylhydroxylamine. To the N-phenylhydroxylamine solution in a 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer is added a slurry of sodium bicarbonate (42 g) in water (40 mL). The mixture is cooled to \u22124\u00b0C in an ice\u2013salt bath before acetyl chloride (26.0 g) (Note 7) is introduced into the well-stirred mixture over 1 hr (Note 8) while the temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0C. Stirring is then continued for 30 min before a solution of sodium hydroxide (20.0 g) in water (200 mL) is added, keeping the temperature below 20\u00b0C. The aqueous phase is separated, the tetrahydrofuran phase is diluted with an equal volume of petroleum ether, the aqueous phase is separated again, and the organic phase is extracted with aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution (2 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined aqueous phases are washed with methylene chloride (200 mL) and then neutralized with concentrated hydrochloric acid (cooling employed). The mixture is extracted with methylene chloride (3 \u00d7 100 mL) and the extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure (about one-fifth volume) (Note 9). After the solution is cooled to 40\u00b0C, 100 mL of petroleum ether (bp 60\u201380\u00b0C) is added. The mixture is stirred at 10\u00b0C for 39 min before filtering and washing with additional petroleum ether.

            "A. Methyl 4-bromo-l-butanimidate hydrochloride. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is connected via neck A to a hydrogen chloride water trap using the arrangement shown in Figure 1. A stream of nitrogen (Note 1) is introduced via neck C; the flask is flame-dried and allowed to cool. The stopper is removed from neck B and the flask is charged with 29.6 g (0.20 mol) of 4-bromobutanenitrile (Note 2), 200 mL of dry ether (Note 3) and 7.7 g (0.24 mol; 1.2 equiv based on 1.0 equiv of 4-bromobutanenitrile) of dry methanol (Note 3). The stopper is replaced, and the weight of the flask and its contents are recorded. The flask and its contents are cooled to \u22125\u00b0C by immersion in an ice\u2013salt bath, the nitrogen source is removed, and the gas inlet tube is connected to the cylinder of hydrogen chloride. The cylinder tap is cautiously opened, and hydrogen chloride is allowed to bubble through the reaction mixture at a steady but controlled rate until 18.2 g (0.50 mol; 2.5 equiv based on 1.0 equiv of 4-bromobutanenitrile) has been absorbed (Note 4). A stopper is placed in each neck of the flask and a strip of Parafilm is bound around the edge of each ground-glass connection to ensure an airtight seal.\nFigure 1\nThe flask is stored at 5\u00b0C (refrigerator) for between 48 hr and 5 days (Note 5), after which time a copious precipitate of the title compound is obtained. The mixture is filtered with suction through a dry 100-mm sintered-glass funnel. After all of the product is collected, a large inverted funnel connected to a nitrogen source is positioned about 15 cm above the sintered funnel to provide a blanket of dry, inert gas (Note 6). The product is washed thoroughly with several portions of dry ether, totaling 500 mL, and then dried to constant weight over solid potassium hydroxide in a desiccator evacuated at 12\u201320 mm (water aspirator). There is obtained 39.0 g (90%) (Note 7) of methyl 4-bromo-1-butanimidate hydrochloride as fine white crystals, mp 95\u201397\u00b0C (Note 8).\nB. Trimethyl ortho-4-bromobutanoate. A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask containing an efficient magnetic stirring bar is purged with nitrogen (Note 1) introduced via a pressure-equalizing glass bubbler (Note 9). The flask is charged with 38.9 g (0.18 mol) of methyl 4-bromo-1-butanimidate hydrochloride, 450 mL of dry hexane (Note 3), and 17.3 g (0.54 mol) of dry methanol (Note 3). A stopper is placed in one neck of the flask; the glass bubbler is removed from the other neck and immediately replaced with a gas outlet adapter to which is attached a balloon filled with nitrogen (Note 10). Finally, a strip of Parafilm is bound around the edge of each ground-glass connection to ensure an airtight seal. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 hr, then filtered with suction to remove the precipitated ammonium chloride. The filter cake is washed with two 30-mL portions of dry hexane, and the filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure (water aspirator) at 30\u201340\u00b0C by rotary evaporation to leave a slightly turbid, colorless liquid, to which is added 0.25 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate. This material is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 36.4\u201336.7 g (89\u201390%) (Note 11) of trimethyl ortho-4-bromobutanoate as a colorless oil, bp 65\u00b0C (0.5 mm) (Note 12).\nC. Methyl 7-hydroxyhept-5-ynoate. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dry-ice condenser and a mechanical stirring rod is charged with 750 mL of anhydrous ammonia, via a gas inlet tube, at \u221233\u00b0C (Note 13) under nitrogen (Note 1) and (Note 14). The gas inlet tube is removed, and about 0.1 g of lithium wire (Note 2) is added in small portions until a permanent blue color is obtained. Ferric nitrate (0.1 g) is added to discharge the blue color, and after the solution is stirred for 5 min, 4.24 g (0.611 mol; 2.5 equiv based on 1.0 equiv of propargyl alcohol) of lithium wire is added in small portions. After the addition is complete, the flask is fitted with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing, serum-capped dropping funnel. Stirring is continued for 20 min to obtain a gray suspension of lithium amide, to which is added slowly and dropwise a solution of 13.7 g (0.245 mol; 1.5 equiv based on 1.0 equiv of trimethyl ortho-4-bromobutanoate) of redistilled propargyl alcohol (Note 2) in 15 mL of dry ether (Note 3). After the solution is stirred for 20 min, a solution of 36.4 g (0.160 mol) of trimethyl ortho-4-bromobutanoate in 40 mL of dry ether is added dropwise. Stirring is continued for 3 hr, the reaction vessel is opened to the atmosphere, and its contents are allowed to warm to room temperature over 16\u201318 hr. The mixture is heated at 50\u00b0C on a water bath under a stream of nitrogen to remove any remaining ammonia. This furnishes a gray solid, which is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and 5% sulfuric acid is added in 100-mL portions until a pH of 1 is obtained (Note 15). The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and extracted with three 200-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with 200 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (water aspirator) at 30\u201340\u00b0C by rotary evaporation, to leave 19.1 g (77%) of an essentially pure amber oil (Note 16). This material can be distilled under reduced pressure to afford 16.8 g (67%) (Note 17) of methyl 7-hydroxyhept-5-ynoate as a colorless oil, bp 100\u00b0C (0.05 mm) (Note 18) and (Note 19)."

The resulting clear, pale-yellow solution is stirred for 6 hr (Note 3). After the stirring bar is removed, the reaction mixture is distilled by Kugelrohr apparatus at aspirator vacuum (10 mm) from 25 to 70\u00b0C to afford crude 1-bromo-1-ethoxycyclopropane (Note 4) and (Note 5). The crude product is dissolved in 300 mL of pentane in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask and the resulting solution is chilled to \u221220\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013ethanol: water (30 : 70) bath. While the temperature of the solution is maintained below 25\u00b0C, 300 mL of saturated, aqueous sodium carbonate is carefully added (Note 6). The layers are carefully shaken and separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100-mL of pentane. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and most of the pentane is removed by distillation through a 15-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure. The residue is transferred to a smaller distillation flask and distilled through the same column under aspirator vacuum to afford 47.0\u201357.6 g (59\u201372%) of 1-bromo-1-ethoxycyclopropane as a colorless liquid (bp 35\u201343\u00b0C, 10 mm) (Note 7) and (Note 8).\nCaution! Because of the relatively large amount of pyrophoric tert-butyllithium involved, the following preparation should be performed in a hood behind a safety shield.\nB. (E)-1-Ethoxy-1-(1-hydroxy-2-butenyl)cyclopropane. A 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a gas inlet adapter, a septum, a 250-mL graduated addition funnel capped with a septum, and a magnetic stirring bar (Note 9). The flask is charged with 500 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 10) and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The addition funnel is charged with 177 mL (19.2 g, 0.30 mol) of tert-butyllithium (Note 11), transferred from the reagent bottle via a stainless-steel cannula under positive nitrogen pressure. The tert-butyllithium is added dropwise to the stirred diethyl ether over approximately 20 min while the cooling bath is maintained at \u221278\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, 26.4 g (0.16 mol) of freshly prepared 1-bromo-1-ethoxycyclopropane is added to the reaction over about 5 min by syringe. The resulting cloudy, colorless, or light-yellow reaction mixture is stirred for 20\u201325 min, and a solution of 7.0 g (0.10 mol) of crotonaldehyde (Note 12) in 50 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether (chilled to \u221278\u00b0C) is added via a stainless-steel cannula under positive nitrogen pressure. The reaction mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for an additional 10 min, warmed to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath, and carefully quenched with 100 mL of saturated, aqueous ammonium chloride. The layers are shaken and separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. After the crude adduct is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, it is filtered through a 10-cm pad of silica gel (Note 13) in a sintered-glass funnel with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane. After concentrating again on a rotary evaporator, the crude adduct is obtained as a pale-yellow oil (14.2\u201315.6 g) (Note 14). This material is not further purified, but is used directly in the next reaction.\nC. (E)-2-(1-Propenyl)cyclobutanone. To a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added 15.3 g (0.098 mol) of (E)-1-ethoxy-1-(1-hydroxy-2-butenyl)cyclopropane, 500 mL of reagent-grade diethyl ether, and 6.6 mL (4.3 g, 0.049 mol) of 48% aqueous fluoboric acid (Note 15). After the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min at room temperature, it is quenched with 60 mL (0.06 mol) of 1 M aqueous sodium carbonate. The layers are carefully shaken and separated, and the organic phase is washed with three 125-mL portions of water (Note 16). The combined aqueous layers are extracted with 100 mL of diethyl ether and the organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator without external heating and the residue is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column under aspirator vacuum. The product, 7.2\u20138.3 g (66\u201375% yield from crotonaldehyde), is obtained as a colorless oil, bp 61\u201365\u00b0C (10 mm) (Note 17)."

Magnesium turnings (10.7 g, 0.44 g-atom) are placed in a dry, 300-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped with a rubber septum, a thermometer, another rubber septum, and a reflux condenser connected to an argon flow line. The apparatus is flushed with argon, and an argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction. Anhydrous diethyl ether (40 mL) (Note 1) and 0.1 mL of 1,2-dibromoethane are placed in the reaction flask with a syringe, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 min. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 45.4 g (0.37 mol) of chloromethyltrimethylsilane (Note 2) in 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether with a syringe. With stirring, about 10 mL of this solution is added at once. When the reaction has started (Note 3), the remaining solution is added dropwise at such a rate that a gentle reflux is maintained throughout the addition (addition time ca. 2 hr). After the exothermic reaction subsides, the resulting solution is stirred at reflux by heating for an additional 1 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and is used in step B.\nB. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane. (See (Note 4).) A dry, 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a liquid paraffin-sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 5), a rubber septum, 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped with another rubber septum, and a reflux condenser connected to an argon flow line. The apparatus is flushed with argon, and an argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction. A solution of 91.2 g (0.33 mol) of diphenyl phosphorazidate (Note 6) in 350 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is placed in the flask with a syringe. The rubber septum is quickly replaced by a low-temperature thermometer. The Grignard reagent prepared in Step A is transferred to the dropping funnel with a syringe. The flask is cooled with an ice\u2013sodium chloride bath, and the stirring is started. When the internal temperature reaches \u221210\u00b0C, the Grignard reagent is added dropwise at such a rate that the internal temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0C (addition time ca. 1.5 hr) (Note 7). After the addition is complete, the ice\u2013salt bath is replaced with an ice bath and the mixture is stirred for 2 hr, then allowed to stand in the ice bath for 14\u201316 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled again to \u221215\u00b0C with an ice\u2013sodium chloride bath. With vigorous stirring, 35 mL of cold water is carefully added dropwise at such a rate that the internal temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0C (addition time about 1 hr), and the stirring is continued for 0.5 hr (Note 8). The reaction mixture is then filtered by suction using a glass filter. The white solid is thoroughly washed with three 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate is washed with two 100-mL portions of cold water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the sodium sulfate is removed by filtration, the filtrate is placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a 30-cm Vigreux column (15-mm diameter). With constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer, the solution is slowly concentrated to a volume of about 200 mL by distillation at atmospheric pressure with the bath temperature below 45\u00b0C. The concentration time requires about 6 hr (Note 9) and (Note 10). The remaining deep-yellow solution is distilled through the same apparatus under reduced pressure between 100 mm at 0\u00b0C (bath temperature) and 15 mm at 40\u00b0C (bath temperature) until no more volatile material comes over, and the distillate is collected in a receiver cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. The distillate is dried again over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and 100 mL of hexane (Note 11) is added to the filtrate. In a manner similar to that described above, this solution is slowly concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure through a 30-cm Vigreux column (15-mm diameter). The color of the distillate gradually becomes yellow. Concentration is continued until the temperature of the vapor reaches 68\u00b0C (final oil-bath temperature 87\u00b0C). The concentration requires about 3 hr (Note 9). Approximately 80\u2013110 mL of the remaining yellow hexane solution contains 220\u2013230 mmol of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (67\u201370% yield based on diphenyl phosphorazidate) (Note 12) and (Note 13). This hexane solution can be stored without decomposition for periods exceeding 6 months at 0\u00b0C with protection from light."

            "Caution: Thiophenol (stench!!) and sulfuryl chloride are highly toxic. Steps A and B should be carried out in an efficient fume hood while wearing gloves and adequate eye protection. Sodium nitromethylate is explosive when dry and should be handled only as a slurry.\nA. Phenylsulfenyl chloride. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a pressure-equalizing 125-mL dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with thiophenol (21 mL) (Note 1), dry triethylamine (0.25 mL), and dry pentane (100 mL) (Note 2) under a blanket of nitrogen. The remaining neck of the flask is stoppered and the nitrogen is allowed to sweep gently through the flask and out of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask and its contents are cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath and stirring is begun. The dropping funnel is charged with sulfuryl chloride (19 mL) (Note 1). The sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise over a 1-hr period to the chilled thiophenol solution with stirring. During this addition, a thick layer of white solid forms. It gradually dissolves as it is broken down. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to stir for 1 hr longer while slowly warming to room temperature. During the course of the addition and subsequent stirring, the clear, pale-yellow solution becomes dark orange-red. The dropping funnel is replaced with an outlet adapter connected to a vacuum pump and the nitrogen inlet is exchanged for a ground glass stopper. The pentane and excess sulfuryl chloride are removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The outlet adapter is replaced by a short-path distillation apparatus adapted for use under reduced pressure. The oily red residue is distilled to give phenylsulfenyl chloride as a blood-red liquid (26 g, 87%), bp 41\u201342\u00b0C (1.5 mm) (Note 3). This compound is stored under nitrogen until used in Part B (Note 4).\nB. (Phenylthio)nitromethane. Freshly cut sodium metal (4.8 g) is added to absolute ethanol (100 mL) in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask with a ground-glass joint and allowed to react until the metal is completely consumed (Note 5). To this mixture is added a solution of nitromethane (12 g) (Note 6) in absolute ethanol (100 mL) with swirling. The phenylsulfenyl chloride (prepared earlier) is quickly poured into a 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet/outlet adapter, and a calcium chloride drying tube, and is diluted with dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (250 mL) (Note 7). Stirring is begun, the drying tube is removed, and the sodium nitromethane\u2013ethanol slurry is added quickly in one portion to the THF solution (Note 8). The deep-red solution immediately turns yellow and stirring is continued for a further 10 min. The reaction mixture consists of solid and liquid. It is dissolved in 200 mL of a 1 N sodium hydroxide solution and poured into a 1000-mL separatory funnel. Dichloromethane (200 mL) is added (Note 9), the aqueous layer (lower layer) is separated, and the organic layer further extracted with 1 N sodium hydroxide (2 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 10). The combined aqueous layers are washed with dichloromethane (500 mL) and acidified to pH 3 using 1 N hydrochloric acid. The brown organic layer that appears is separated, diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at water aspirator pressure to give 18\u201319 g (60\u201365%) of crude (phenylthio)nitromethane as an orange-red oil. This material is of sufficient purity for many purposes. Further purification may be effected by distilling at reduced pressure to give (phenylthio)nitromethane (14 g, 50%) as a pale-yellow oil, bp 85\u201395\u00b0C at 0.05 mm (Note 11),(Note 12),(Note 13),(Note 14)."

            "An oven-dried (Note 1), 500-mL, septum-capped, round-bottomed flask is flushed with nitrogen, charged with 70 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 2), and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. After the apparatus has cooled, 157 mL of a 2.1 M solution of butyllithium (0.330 mol) (Note 3) is added using a 50-mL syringe. The contents are mixed by swirling the flask and kept at \u221278\u00b0C until needed. An oven-dried, 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar and capped with a septum, is cooled under a nitrogen purge (Note 4). The flask is charged with 500 mL of THF and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. A 100-mL graduated cylinder (Note 5) is fitted with a septum in which an 8-mm hole has been bored (Note 6). A 9-mm glass tube that can be connected to either a nitrogen or acetylene line through a three-way valve (Note 6) and (Note 7) is inserted through the septum of the graduated cylinder. A double-ended needle is used to connect the cylinder to the 2-L reaction flask. After the cylinder and reaction flask have been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, 70 mL of THF is introduced into the cylinder, and the cylinder is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (Note 8). Acetylene (Note 7) and (Note 9) is introduced through the 9-mm tube into the bottom of the graduated cylinder at such a rate that 30 mL (Note 10) has been added in 20 min; excess acetylene that does not dissolve in the THF is allowed to flow through the double-ended needle to the 2-L reaction flask. The cold acetylene solution is transferred via the double-ended needle to the 2-L reaction flask. While the solution is cooling in the \u221278\u00b0C bath, nitrogen is blown over the surface to purge the system completely of acetylene (Note 11). The precooled butyllithium/THF solution is then slowly added by a double-ended needle over a 1-hr period (Note 12). The clear solution of lithium acetylide is stirred for an additional 15 min at \u221278\u00b0C before 48.4 mL of (\u2212)-fenchone (0.300 mol, (Note 13)) is slowly added via syringe. The solution immediately becomes yellow. After the addition is complete, the cold bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 3 hr while it warms to room temperature. The flask is opened to the atmosphere and 400 mL of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid is added (Note 14). The quenched reaction is stirred for 20 min and then transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The aqueous material is separated and 200 mL of pentane is added. The organic layer is then sequentially washed with 100 mL of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid, 300 mL of water, and finally 100 mL of saturated brine. The combined aqueous material is extracted with 200 mL of ether. The organic extracts are combined, dried with magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Concentration (rotary evaporation, 40\u00b0C under aspirator pressure) provides a thick, yellow oil that is distilled to obtain 48.2 g (90%) of the alcohol as a pale-yellow oil (bp 51\u201355\u00b0C at 0.05 mm) (Note 15)."

            "A dry (Note 2), 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and equipped with a rubber septum inlet is flushed with dry nitrogen and charged with 450 mL of purified tetrahydrofuran (Note 3). After the contents of the flask are cooled using a dry ice\u2013acetone bath, 72 g (1.2 mol) of methyl vinyl ether is distilled into the flask from a commercial cylinder (Note 4). The septum is replaced, under a positive pressure of nitrogen gas, with a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum inlet. The stirred contents of the flask are continuously cooled while 1.0 mol of tert-butyllithium in pentane solution (Caution! Solutions of this reagent are pyrophoric and extreme care should be exercised when carrying out this manipulation!) (Note 5) is transferred to the addition funnel and subsequently added to the mixture dropwise over ca. 1.5 hr. The resulting yellow slurry is allowed to warm slowly to 0\u00b0C over ca. 3 hr (Note 6). With the addition of dry ice to the bath, the near-colorless solution is recooled to ca. \u221278\u00b0C and 84.6 g (0.78 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 7) is transferred to the addition funnel and subsequently added dropwise to the stirred mixture. The cold bath is removed and, after the mixture has reached room temperature, is allowed to stir for an additional 1 hr (Note 8). The contents of the flask are carefully poured into a 2-L separatory funnel which contains ca. 400 g of ice and ca. 200 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 9). After separation of the aqueous layer, the organic solution is washed with water (12 \u00d7 250 mL) (Note 10), dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and distilled to give 89\u201395 g (88\u201394%) of 1-(methoxyvinyl) trimethylsilane (bp 102\u2013104\u00b0C, 760 mm), nD20 1.4173 (Note 11) and (Note 12).\nA 50-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 65 g (0.50 mol) of 1-(methoxyvinyl)trimethylsilane and 300 mL of a 4:1 v/v mixture of acetone and 1.0 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (Note 13). After the pale-yellow-green solution is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, it is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and 150 mL each of water and diethyl ether are added. After separation, the aqueous layer is washed with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 50 mL), and these extracts are combined with the organic material.

The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred for an additional 1 hr. Most of the solvent and excess acetic anhydride are directly removed with a rotary evaporator at 25\u00b0C under water pump pressure (Note 10).

The flask is stoppered with a septum cap and purged with argon. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide, Ti(OiPr)4, (4.48 mL, 0.015 mol) (Note 3) is introduced through the septum via a 10-mL syringe. The stirred limpid solution immediately turns yellow. After a few minutes distilled water (0.27 mL, 0.015 mol) is added dropwise using a calibrated syringe. Strong stirring is maintained until there is total dissolution of water and formation of a pale-yellow solution (after 25 min). Methyl p-tolyl sulfide (4.09 mL, 4.20 g, 0.030 mol) (Note 4) dissolved in 5 mL of methylene chloride is introduced with a 10-mL syringe that is then rinsed with 5 mL of methylene chloride. The flask is cooled (\u221230\u00b0C) with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath while it is stirred for 40 min. At this point 5.54 mL of 80% cumene hydroperoxide (Note 5) (0.030 mol, 5.70 g) is added dropwise from a 10-mL syringe, with stirring, during 5 min. The reaction flask is kept in a freezer (\u221223\u00b0C) overnight (15 hr) (Note 6). Hydrolysis is then effected by adding 5.05 mL of water followed by vigorous stirring for 90 min at room temperature (20\u00b0C).\nA large sintered-glass funnel (9-cm diameter, porosity grade 2) is partially filled with Celite (Celite height: 2.5 cm) and then impregnated with methylene chloride. The suspension resulting from hydrolysis is poured in portions onto the Celite under suction by a water pump. The Celite is washed many times with 50-mL portions of technical-grade methylene chloride. In order to accelerate filtration and to improve washing, the surface of the Celite is disturbed from time to time with a spatula. The filtration time is approximately 50 min. The filtrate (300 mL) is then vigorously stirred for 1 hr in a mixture of 80 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide and 40 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic phase [negative test for peroxides using a Merck kit (Merkoquant 1001 l)] is decanted, dried (magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate), filtered and concentrated in a B\u00fcchi apparatus (bath temperature: 45\u00b0C) to leave 10 g of an oily material that is a mixture of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide, 2-phenyl-2-propanol, and some starting sulfide.\nOptically pure sulfoxide is then easily isolated as follows. The crude product (10 g) is diluted with 4 mL of a solvent mixture (ethyl acetate/cyclohexane = 9 : 1). This solution is poured onto a column (75-mm diameter) filled with 120 g of silica gel (Merck 230\u2013400 mesh) for flash chromatography. Elution is performed under gravity and requires ca. 200 mL of the above solvent system, followed by ca. 200 mL of ethyl acetate. 2-Phenyl-2-propanol mixed with methyl p-tolyl sulfide is eluted in the first fraction (ca. 150 mL, monitored by TLC). The subsequent fractions are collected (ca. 300 mL) and evaporated, giving 4.0 g of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide [\u03b1]D \u221288\u00b0 (acetone, c 1), 89% ee, 85% yield. This material is crystallized once from 60 mL of hot hexane, to afford, after 2 hr at 20\u00b0C, 3.14 g (68%) of enantiomerically pure (Note 7) (S)-(\u2212)-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide as needles, [\u03b1]D \u2212142\u00b0 (acetone, c 1), mp 73\u201376\u00b0C (Reichert microscope with heating system).\nThe chemical purity of the compound is checked by 1NMR (250 MHz) and thin-layer chromatography (silica gel, eluent: ethyl acetate), which show the complete absence of the corresponding sulfide and sulfone (Note 8)."

In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser (the top of which is connected to a calcium chloride drying tube) are placed 50.4 g (0.4 mol) of 2-methylcyclohexane-1,3-dione2 and 500 mL of dry methanol. To this stirred solution is added dropwise 168 mL of commercial Triton B (40% in methanol) (Note 1) and (Note 2). After the additional is complete, the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 10 min and 60.0 g (0.423 mol) of methyl iodide is added portionwise. This solution is then stirred and heated under reflux for 16\u201320 hr (Note 3). After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, about 400 mL of methanol is removed by rotary evaporation. The residue is poured into a mixture of 100 mL (1.2 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 100 g of ice to decompose the O-alkylated product (Note 4), and the mixture is stirred for 30 min. The precipitated solid (recovered starting material) is collected by filtration and the filtrate is extracted 4 times with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are washed with 5% sodium thiosulfate solution (4 \u00d7 100 mL), saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered.

(S)-(+)-3-Hydroxy-2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone. In a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an air-reflux condenser are placed 3 L of tap water and 450 g of sucrose (Note 7). The mixture is stirred at 30\u00b0C, and 200 g of dry baker's yeast (Note 8) is added with stirring, whereupon brisk fermentation takes place (Note 2). This fermenting mixture is stirred at 30\u00b0C for 10 min and a solution of 15 g (0.107 mol) of 2,2-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione in 95% ethanol (30 mL) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (120 mL) is added portionwise (Note 9). The mixture is stirred at 30\u00b0C for 40\u201348 hr (Note 10). Diethyl ether (about 200 mL) and Celite (about 50 g) are then added to the mixture and it is left to stand overnight. After the flocculated yeast cells are precipitated, the mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite (Note 11). The filter cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 100 mL) and the combined filtrate and washings are saturated with sodium chloride and extracted 4 times with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (200 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Ethyl acetate is removed by rotary evaporation and the residue (about 20 g) is chromatographed over 200 g of silica gel (Fuji Davison 820 MH gel) (Note 12). Elution with hexane\u2013ethyl acetate (10 : 1\u20135 : 1) gives 5\u20136 g of recovered starting material.

A 250-mL, two necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a septum, two-way stopcock used as a gas inlet and outlet, and a magnetic stirrer, is charged with a solution of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-2,4-pentanedionatorhodium (117.6 mg, 0.4 mmol) (Note 1) in dry tetrahydrofuran (2.5 mL) under a gentle stream of argon. Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (97.8 mg, 0.44 mmol) (Note 2) is added in one portion by microsyringe via the septum, resulting in a color change from yellow to orange. Solid 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (170.4 mg, 0.4 mmol) (Note 3) is added all at once, with removal and immediate replacement of the septum cap. The color of the solution darkens to a deep orange-red, and precipitation of an orange solid occurs over 1\u20132 min. Dry 30\u201340 petroleum ether (10 mL) is added with vigorous stirring. The mixture is allowed to settle, and the solvent is removed first by syringe and finally under reduced pressure with an oil pump. Argon is admitted and the catalyst is dried and stored under argon (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nB. Methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenepentanoate. A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with methyl acrylate (50.0 mL, 0.556 mol), propionaldehyde (60.0 mL, 0.832 mol), and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (3.0 g, 26.8 mmol) (Note 6). After the solution is stirred briefly to ensure complete dissolution, the flask is stoppered and set aside at ambient temperature for 7 days. The reaction mixture is then dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL) and washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid (100 mL), and the organic layer is separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Solvent is removed under reduced pressure after filtration and the residue is fractionated through a 12-in. vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The main fraction boiling at 54\u00b0C (0.1 mm) is collected as a water-white liquid to afford 57 g (71%) of condensation product (Note 7). Care must be taken in the distillation to avoid contamination by high-boiling impurities that may inactivate the catalyst.\nC. Methyl dl-anti-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate. Freshly distilled methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenepentanoate (14.4 g, 0.1 mol) is added to the biphosphinorhodium catalyst (catalyst/substrate ratio 1/250) (Note 8) in the flask from Step A. Methanol [40 mL, distilled from Mg(OMe)2] is added. The apparatus is sealed with a rubber septum, the side arm is connected to a burette line, and the apparatus is then transferred to a dry ice/2-propanol bath. The vessel is evacuated to 1 mm 3 times and filled with hydrogen (Note 9) each time, the burette being partially filled on the last occasion. The mixture is warmed to near-ambient temperature and transferred to a water bath at 12\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0C (Note 10). When thermal equilibration is complete, the stirrer is started so as to create a deep vortex in the reaction solution, which darkens to a brick-red color with rapid uptake of hydrogen. The burette is recharged with hydrogen as necessary, and gas absorption occurs steadily until the reaction is complete, when ca. 2.5 L of hydrogen has been consumed (Note 11). Completion of reaction can be readily checked by addition of 50 \u03bcL of methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenepentanoate to the reaction solution by microsyringe, leading to a perceptible burst of gas absorption. At this stage the flask is disconnected from the hydrogen line and flushed with argon and the contents are transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask. Solvent is removed at ambient temperature on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is dissolved in diethyl ether (40 mL) and 30\u201340 petroleum ether (150 mL). The mixture is filtered through a small plug of silica (60 \u03bcm, Merck flash chromatography grade) that effectively retains the residual rhodium catalyst (Note 1). Solvents are removed on a rotary evaporator, and the colorless product (Note 12) is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus, bp 50\u00b0C (~ 0.5 mm). The yield of methyl dl-anti-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate is 13.3 g (91%), chemically and stereochemically pure by 13C NMR (Note 13).\nThis procedure may be adapted for kinetic resolution of the reactant, employing an optically active biphosphinorhodium catalyst (Note 13)."

The flask is swept with nitrogen and filled with 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the addition funnel is charged with 123 mL (1.00 mol) of freshly distilled boron trifluoride etherate via cannula (Note 2). The boron trifluoride etherate is added dropwise to the phenylalanine slurry over a 30-min period with stirring, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr, resulting in a colorless, homogeneous solution. The addition funnel is then charged via cannula with 88 g (110 mL, 1.15 mol) of 20 M borane\u2013dimethyl sulfide complex (Note 3), which is added carefully to the vigorously refluxing solution over a 100-min period. During the course of the addition there is continuous evolution of dimethyl sulfide and hydrogen gas, and the solution turns from orange to light brown. A vigorous exotherm occurs approximately half way through the addition period. (Caution! See (Note 4)) The solution is heated at reflux for an additional 6 hr after the addition is complete (Note 5) and (Note 6), then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The excess borane is quenched by the slow addition of 125 mL of a 1:1 tetrahydrofuran\u2013water solution followed by 750 mL of 5 M aqueous sodium hydroxide. The resulting two-phase mixture is heated at reflux for 12 hr, cooled to room temperature, and filtered through a coarse fritted funnel. The residual solids are washed with two 25-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove the bulk of the tetrahydrofuran. The resulting slurry is extracted with one 400-mL and three 200-mL portions of dichloromethane.

The mixture is lowered into an oil bath, preheated to 135\u00b0C, and is stirred until dissolution is achieved (ca. 5 min). The distillation receiver is cooled in an ice bath, and ca. 120 mL of ethanol is collected from the reaction over a 2.5-hr period. The oil bath is removed on cessation of the ethanol distillation.

            "A. (S)-3-(1-Oxopropyl)-4-(phenylmethyl)-2-oxazolidinone. A dry, 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 17.7 g (0.100 mol) of (S)-4-(phenylmethyl)-2-oxazolidinone,2 capped with a rubber septum, and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, 300 mL (Note 1), is then added to the flask via cannula, and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath. A solution of 68.3 mL (0.101 mol) of 1.47 M butyllithium in hexane (Note 2) is transferred via cannula first to a dry, septum-stoppered, 100-mL graduated cylinder with a ground-glass joint, and then to the reaction flask over a 10-min period. The solution may turn yellow and slightly cloudy. Freshly distilled propionyl chloride (9.6 mL, 0.11 mol, (Note 3) is added in one portion by syringe after completion of the addition of butyllithium. The resulting clear, nearly colorless solution is stirred for 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature over a 30-min period. Excess propionyl chloride is quenched by the addition of 60 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The bulk of the tetrahydrofuran and hexane is removed on a rotary evaporator (bath temp. ca. 25\u201330\u00b0C), and the resulting slurry is extracted with two 80-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 75 mL of an aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide solution and 75 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue, a light-yellow oil, is placed in a refrigerator overnight to crystallize. The resulting crystalline solid is pulverized and triturated with a minimum quantity of cold hexane. After filtration and drying 21.2\u201322.3 g (91\u201396%) of the desired product is obtained as a colorless crystalline solid, mp 44\u201346\u00b0C (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nB. The boron aldol reaction. Into a dry, 2-L flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar is introduced 21.2 g (0.091 mol) of the acylated oxazolidinone. The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and swept with nitrogen. The solid is dissolved in 200 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 6), which is introduced via syringe. A thermometer is inserted through the rubber septum, and the contents of the flask are cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath. To this cooled solution is added via syringe 27 mL (0.107 mol) of dibutylboron triflate followed by 16.7 mL (0.120 mol) of triethylamine (Note 7) dropwise at such a rate as to keep the internal temperature below +3\u00b0C. The solution may turn slightly yellow or green during the dibutylboron triflate addition, and then to light yellow when triethylamine is added. The ice bath is then replaced with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath (Note 8). When the internal temperature drops below \u221265\u00b0C, 10.3 mL (0.101 mol) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde is added over a 5-min period via syringe. The solution is stirred for 20 min in the dry ice\u2013acetone bath, then for 1 hr at ice-bath temperature. The reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of 100 mL of a pH 7 aqueous phosphate buffer and 300 mL of methanol. To this cloudy solution is added by syringe 300 mL of 2 : 1 methanol\u201330% aqueous hydrogen peroxide at such a rate as to keep the internal temperature below +10\u00b0C. After the solution is stirred for an additional 1 hr, the volatile material is removed on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 25\u201330\u00b0C. The resulting slurry is extracted with three 500-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with 500 mL of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 500 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, to afford 35\u201336 g of a white solid (Note 9). The unpurified aldol adduct has a diastereomeric purity of >97% as determined by gas chromatography (Note 10). The solid is recrystallized from ca. 500 mL of 1 : 2 ethyl acetate\u2013hexane to yield 25.8 g (84%) of the desired aldol adduct, mp 92\u201393\u00b0C (Note 12). The mother liquor is purified by flash chromatography (column dimensions: 8 \u00d7 20 cm) with flash-grade silica gel (Note 13).3 On elution with 25% ethyl acetate-hexane, an additional 2.8 g (9%) of diastereomerically pure material is obtained.\nC. Chiral auxiliary removal. A 500-mL flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 8.48 g (0.025 mol) of the aldol adduct and 125 mL of 4 : 1 tetrahydrofuran\u2013distilled water. The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, purged with nitrogen, and cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. To this solution is added via syringe 10.2 mL (0.100 mol) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Note 14) over a 5-min period, followed by 0.96 g (0.040 mol) of lithium hydroxide in 50 mL of distilled water. Some gas evolves from the clear solution. After the solution is stirred for 1 hr, the septum is removed, and 12.6 g (0.100 mol) of sodium sulfite in 75 mL of distilled water is added. The bulk of the tetrahydrofuran is removed on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 25\u201330\u00b0C, and the resulting mixture (pH 12\u201313) is extracted with three 100-mL portions of dichloromethane to remove the oxazolidinone auxiliary. The aqueous layer is cooled in an ice bath and acidified to pH 1 by the addition of an aqueous 6 M hydrochloric acid solution. The resulting cloudy solution containing the \u03b2-hydroxy acid is then extracted with five 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated, affording 5.1 g of a white crystalline solid, which is dissolved in approximately 200 mL of an aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. This solution is extracted with two 100-mL portions of dichloromethane and then acidified and extracted with ethyl acetate as before. The combined dichloromethane extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to afford 4.35 g (99%) of the oxazolidinone auxiliary as a white crystalline solid. This solid is recrystallized from 50 mL of 2 : 1 ethyl acetate\u2013hexane to give 3.95 g (89%) of the recovered oxazolidinone as white crystals, mp 85\u201387\u00b0C. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to afford 4.50 g (100%) of the desired hydroxy acid as a white crystalline solid, which is recrystallized from ca. 20 mL of carbon tetrachloride to give 4.00\u20134.03 g (89\u201390%) of pure (2S*,3S*)-3-hydroxy-3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-2-methylpropanoic acid, mp 89.5\u201390\u00b0C (Note 15)."

In a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a large magnetic stirring bar under argon, a mixture of L-tartaric acid (101 g, 0.673 mol) (Note 2), 2,2-dimethoxypropane (190 mL, 161 g, 1.54 mol) (Note 3), methanol (40 mL) (Note 4), and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.4 g, 2.1 mmol) (Note 5) is warmed on a steam bath with occasional swirling until a dark-red homogeneous solution is obtained (Note 6). Additional 2,2-dimethoxypropane (95 mL, 80.5 g, 0.77 mol) and cyclohexane (450 mL) (Note 7) are added and the flask is fitted with a 30-cm Vigreux column and a variable reflux distilling head. The mixture is heated to reflux with internal stirring and the acetone\u2013cyclohexane and methanol\u2013cyclohexane azeotropes are slowly removed (Note 8). Additional 2,2-dimethoxypropane (6 mL, 5.1 g, 49 mmol) is then added and the mixture heated under reflux for 15 min (Note 9). After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, anhydrous potassium carbonate (1 g, 7.2 mmol) is added and the mixture is stirred until the reddish color has abated (Note 10). Volatile material is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator) and the residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum to afford the product as a pale-yellow oil, bp 94\u2013101\u00b0C (0.5 mm); 125\u2013135 g (0.57\u20130.62 mmol, 85\u201392% yield) (Note 11) and (Note 12).\nB. 2,3-Di-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol. (See (Note 13).) In a dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a large magnetic stirring bar is suspended lithium aluminum hydride (36 g, 0.95 mol) (Note 14) in diethyl ether (600 mL) (Note 15) under argon. The mixture is stirred and heated to reflux for 30 min. Heating is discontinued while a solution of dimethyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-tartrate (123 g, 0.564 mol) in diethyl ether (300 mL) (Note 15) is added dropwise over 2 hr. Heating is then resumed and the mixture is refluxed for an additional 3 hr. The mixture is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0C (Note 16) and cautiously treated with water (36 mL), 4 N sodium hydroxide solution (36 mL), and water (112 mL) (Note 17). The mixture is then stirred at room temperature until the gray color of unquenched lithium aluminum hydride has completely disappeared (Note 18). The mixture is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel and the inorganic precipitate is extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus (Note 19). The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and volatile material is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum to afford the product as a colorless to pale-yellow oil, bp 94\u2013106\u00b0C (0.4 mm); 50.2\u201360.3 g (0.31\u20130.37 mmol, 54\u201366% yield) (Note 20) and (Note 21).\nC. 1,4-Di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar under argon is placed fresh sodium hydride (33.6 g of a 55% dispersion in oil; 18.5 g, 0.77 mol) (Note 22). The oil is removed by washing with hexanes (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 23) and (Note 24). The flask is fitted with a 500-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, a reflux condenser, and a stopper. Tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) (Note 25) is added under argon. A solution of 2,3-di-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol (55 g, 0.34 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) is then added dropwise with stirring at room temperature (Note 26). Benzyl bromide (91 mL, 130.8 g, 0.76 mol) (Note 27) is then added dropwise via the addition funnel (Note 28). After stirring for 12 hr at room temperature, the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr, cooled in an ice bath, and quenched by addition of water until a clear solution results. Tetrahydrofuran is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator); the residue is diluted with water (500 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 500 mL). The extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of volatile material under reduced pressure (water aspirator) gives crude 1,4-di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol as an oil (115\u2013116 g).\nD. 1,4-Di-O-benzyl-L-threitol. The crude ketal is dissolved in methanol (300 mL), 0.5 N hydrochloric acid (30 mL) is added, and the resulting mixture is heated to reflux. Acetone and methanol are slowly distilled off (Note 29). Additional methanol (50 mL) and 0.5 N hydrochloric acid (20 mL) are added and the mixture is kept at room temperature until ketal hydrolysis is complete. The mixture is diluted with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (500 mL) and extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 500 mL). The ether extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of volatile material under reduced pressure gives crude 1,4-di-O-benzyl-L-threitol as a pale-yellow solid. This solid is recrystallized twice from chloroform/hexanes to provide 59\u201365 g (195\u2013215 mmol, 57\u201363% yield) of pure diol, mp 54\u201355\u00b0C (Note 30) and (Note 31). Concentration of the mother liquors from the recrystallizations gives a yellow solid that is chromatographed on 70\u2013230-mesh silica gel 60 (500 g) (Note 32), and eluted with 50% ethyl acetate/hexanes, to provide an additional 20\u201326 g (66\u201386 mmol, 19\u201325% yield) of diol, mp 56\u201357\u00b0C (Note 33)."

            "Magnesium turnings (72.6 g, 3 g-atom) and 1000 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether are placed under argon in a dry, 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a Claisen adapter, a thermometer, an ice\u2013water-cooled condenser, and an argon inlet. The dropping funnel is charged with allyl bromide (158 mL, 1.8 mol) (Note 1) in 150 mL of anhydrous ether. Stirring is initiated and a 10\u201312-mL portion of the allyl bromide solution is run into the reaction flask. The resulting mixture is treated with a few crystals of iodine, whereupon a rise in temperature and clouding of the reaction mixture occurs, indicating that the reaction has begun (Note 2). The remainder of the allyl bromide solution is added dropwise with continued stirring at such a rate as to maintain a gentle reflux. The addition requires approximately 1.5 hr. The mixture is then refluxed for an additional 1.5 hr.\nWhile the Grignard solution is being refluxed, the dropping funnel is charged with bis(tributyltin) oxide (371 g, 0.62 mol) (Note 1) in 150 mL of anhydrous ether. After the reflux, heating is stopped and the bis(tributyltin) oxide solution is added at such a rate as to maintain a reaction temperature of 36\u201338\u00b0C. The addition requires approximately 1 hr. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hr and then stirred overnight at room temperature.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled in a water\u2013ice bath, and a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 35\u00b0C. Ammonium chloride solution is added in portions until addition produces no further exothermic reaction (Note 3). The supernatant solution is decanted through glass wool onto 400 g of ice in a 4-L separatory funnel. The residual solids are washed with three portions of hexane, approximately 1000 mL total, and the washes are decanted into the separatory funnel. After the phases are separated, the aqueous phase is washed with an additional 500-mL portion of hexane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 500 mL of saturated ammonium chloride, and then with 500 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Most of the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator and the residual oil is distilled at reduced pressure using an ice\u2013water-cooled fraction cutting head. After a small forerun, approximately 390\u2013392 g (94% of theory) is collected as a colorless oil, bp 116\u00b0C at 1.6 mm (lit. 155\u00b0C at 17 mm).2"

            "Caution! Many organotin compounds are toxic.4 Their preparation and use should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood.\nA. 4-tert-Butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet, and a condenser (Note 1) is charged with 33.0 g (0.214 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone (Note 2), 1.5 L of dichloromethane (Note 3), and 49.5 g (0.241 mol) of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (Note 4). The solution is stirred under a static argon atmosphere and cooled to 0\u00b0C, at which time the dropwise addition of 40.0 mL (0.238 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Note 5) is begun. After the addition is complete, the brown mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and is stirred at that temperature for 10 hr. At this point, the consumption of starting ketone is verified by thin-layer chromatography (hexane; silica gel). If the reaction is incomplete, more trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added and additional time is allowed. The solvent is removed by distillation and the resulting light-tan material is treated with 1 L of pentane and heated to reflux for 30 min. The tan salts thus obtained are removed by filtration and washed with five 100-mL portions of pentane (Note 6). The combined pentane solutions are washed with two 250-mL portions each of a 10% hydrochloric acid solution, a 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 6 \u00d7 4-cm pad of silica gel (Note 7), and concentrated by distillation. Bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 8) of the resulting yellow oil at 75\u201380\u00b0C (0.5 mm) gives 43\u201345 g (70\u201373%) of the product as a colorless oil (Note 9).\nB. Trimethylvinyltin. To a dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Dewar-type condenser cooled to \u221278\u00b0C, a magnetic stirring bar and a gas inlet leading to a static supply of dry argon (Note 1) are added 11.4 g (0.469 mol) of clean magnesium turnings, 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 10), 3 mL of vinyl bromide, and 0.3 mL of methyl iodide to initiate formation of vinylmagnesium bromide. To this is added a solution of 41 mL (0.624 mol or 66.7 g total) of vinyl bromide in 125 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran via cannula at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux. After addition the mixture is heated to reflux for 1 hr with an oil bath and then cooled to 60\u00b0C.\nTo the resulting slurry of vinylmagnesium bromide (with the condenser still maintained at \u221278\u00b0C) is added via cannula a solution of 61.3 g (0.307 mol) of trimethyltin chloride (Note 11) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran at a rate suitable to maintain a gentle reflux. The temperature is maintained at 60\u00b0C for 5 hr and then the mixture is cooled to room temperature. With the condenser still maintained at \u221278\u00b0C, 200 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution is added by syringe at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux, followed by 200 mL of water. The resulting solution is transferred to a separatory funnel with the aid of 200 mL of pentane and the organic layer is washed with 250 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution. The combined aqueous layers are back-extracted twice with 250 mL of pentane, and the combined organic layers are washed 5 times with 250 mL of saturated ammonium chloride, 10 times with a 10% hydrochloric acid solution, and twice with a saturated sodium chloride solution, and then gravity-filtered through a 9 \u00d7 4-cm pad of silica gel (Note 7) to give approximately 500 mL of a slightly yellow solution. Pentanes are removed by distillation using a 16-cm Vigreux column and a short-path stillhead (Note 12). Continued distillation affords a fraction boiling from 60\u201390\u00b0C, which contains a mixture of 4.9 g of trimethylvinyltin in 16.3 g of tetrahydrofuran (Note 13). At this point the still is cooled to room temperature, the Vigreux column is removed, and the remaining oil is distilled at 95\u2013100\u00b0C to give 38\u201339 g (64\u201366% purified yield) of trimethylvinyltin (Note 14).\nC. 4-tert-Butyl-1-vinylcyclohexene. A dry, 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet, and a condenser (Note 1) is charged with 1.18 g (1.02 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Note 15), 12.9 g (0.305 mol) of lithium chloride (Note 16), and 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 10). This mixture is stirred for 15 min under a static argon atmosphere; then a solution of 28.0 g (0.0979 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate and 19.0 g (0.0997 mol) of trimethylvinyltin in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added, followed by an additional 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The resulting, almost colorless solution is heated to a gentle reflux for 48 hr (Note 17). The mixture is cooled to room temperature and partitioned between 500 mL of water and 250 mL of pentane. The aqueous layer is back-extracted with two 200-mL portions of pentane. The combined organic layers are washed with two 250-mL portions each of a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution, water, and a concentrated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 4 \u00d7 4-cm pad of silica gel (Note 7) and concentrated by distillation using a 10-cm Vigreux column. Bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 8) of the resulting yellow oil at 65\u201368\u00b0C (0.55 mm) gives 12.6\u201312.8 g (78\u201379%) of the coupled product (Note 18).\nD. 1-(4-tert-Butylcyclohexen-1-yl)-2-propen-1-one. To a dry, 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, and a gas inlet connected to a static argon atmosphere (Note 1), are added 1.12 g (0.968 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Note 15), 13.2 g (0.312 mol) of lithium chloride (Note 16), and 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 10), followed by a solution of 28.6 g (0.100 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate and 19.1 g (0.100 mol) of trimethylvinyltin in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and then an additional 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran. A gas bag (Note 19) filled with carbon monoxide is attached to the gas inlet and the apparatus is flushed with carbon monoxide. The gas bag is refilled with carbon monoxide and reattached to the gas inlet. The mixture is then heated to 55\u00b0C (Note 20). After 2\u20134 hr, a large amount of the carbon monoxide has been absorbed into solution and the gas bag is refilled and reattached to the gas inlet. After a total of 40 hr, the reaction mixture darkens and is cooled to room temperature (Note 21). This solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, diluted with 500 mL of pentane, and washed successively with two 300-mL portions each of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, water again, and saturated sodium chloride solution. The resulting yellow solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 6 \u00d7 4-cm pad of silica gel (Note 7), and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Slow bulb-to-bulb distillation (Note 8) and (Note 22) of the brown oil at 85\u201395\u00b0C (0.35 mm) gives 14.3\u201314.5 g (74\u201375%) of the product as a colorless oil (Note 23)."

A 25-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a rubber septum, a 10-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser. The apparatus is connected through the condenser to a nitrogen source and an oil bubbler (Note 1). The flask is charged with 4.9 g (60 mmol) of 1-hexyne (Note 2) through the addition funnel. While the solution is stirred slowly, 6.7 mL (60 mmol) of catecholborane (Note 3) is injected by syringe through the septum cap. The exothermic reaction is maintained at 60\u201370\u00b0C by intermittent cooling in an ice\u2013water bath. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is stirred for 15 min. The rubber septum is replaced by a glass stopper, and the mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C and stirred for an additional 2 hr. The flask is cooled to room temperature, the condenser is replaced by a short-path distillation head, and the mixture is distilled at reduced pressure to give 9.5\u201310.5 g (78\u201387%) of clear, colorless product, bp 75\u201376\u00b0C (0.10 mm) [lit.2 bp 82\u00b0C (0.25 mm)] (Note 4).\nB.

A 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet at the top, is charged with 5.00 g (9.68 mmol) of cholesta-3,5-dien-3-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1), 6.92 mL (29.03 mmol) of tributylamine (Note 7), 0.043 g (0.19 mmol) of palladium acetate, 0.100 g (0.38 mmol) of triphenylphosphine, and 20.2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The mixture is gently flushed with nitrogen for 1\u20132 min. and capped with a rubber septum. Formic acid, 99%, 0.73 mL (19.42 mmol), is added from a syringe dropwise and with swirling during 2\u20133 min. The resulting mixture is warmed in an oil bath at 60\u00b0C for 1 hr with continuous stirring under nitrogen. During this period the mixture becomes black. The contents of the flask are poured into 50 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with two 75-mL portions of ethyl ether. The combined organic phases are then washed with 50 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid, 15 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and two 10-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, and are then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, the ether is evaporated at reduced pressure, and the solid residue (3.92\u20134.16 g) is purified by open-column chromatography on 100 g of basic aluminum oxide (Note 8) using hexane as eluent to give 3.12\u20133.22 g of nearly pure cholesta-3,5-diene, which is recrystallized from acetone to give a first crop (2.92\u20133.00 g) as white needles (Note 9), mp 81.5\u201382.5\u00b0C (lit.3 mp 79.5\u201380\u00b0C) (Note 6) and a second crop (0.11\u20130.15 g, 85\u201388% overall yield), mp 79.5\u201380.5\u00b0C (Note 6)."

To the flask are added (\u2212)-menthol (Note 2) (15.63 g, 100 mmol) and 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 3). To this stirred solution is added dropwise through the dropping funnel butyllithium in hexane (Note 4) (1.60 M, 55 mL, 88 mmol), transferred by syringe, at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20\u00b0C (about 10 min). When the addition is complete, the methyl ester [either methyl cinnamate (Note 5) (16.21 g, 100 mmol) or methyl nicotinate (Note 5) (13.71 g, 100 mmol)], dissolved in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran, is added in one lot to the solution and washed in with an additional 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran.

            "Caution! Hydrogen peroxide attacks the skin and may decompose violently. The first step should be carried out behind a safety screen, and the operator should wear safety glasses and rubber gloves. Air must not be admitted to the hot distillation residue in Step 2.\nA. 2(5H)-Furanone. A 6-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two condensers, a dropping funnel, and a 12 \u00d7 55-mm magnetic stirring bar is charged with 480 g (5 mol) of furfural (Note 1) and 2.0 L of methylene chloride. The addition of 200 g of sodium sulfate (Note 2) and 150 g of N,N-dimethylethanolamine (Note 3) in one portion each is followed immediately by 460 g of formic acid (Note 4), carefully added in portions over a period of 2 min, after which 100 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Note 5) is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred vigorously. After 5 min the mixture will reflux and another 800 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise during 9 hr (Note 6) while stirring is continued. When the addition is complete, the mixture is vigorously stirred as long as it refluxes and then stirred gently overnight. The organic phase is separated, and the water phase is extracted with the 200 mL of methylene chloride that is used to wash out residues from the reaction flask.\nThe methylene chloride phase is washed with two 150-mL portions of saturated sodium disulfite solution (Note 7) and dried over magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate. After a negative peroxide test (Note 8), the solvent is removed. The crude product (255 g) is fractionated through a 30-cm Vigreux column. The material boiling at 85\u201385\u00b0C (13 mm) is collected to give 210 g of butenolide, which is yellow because of some high-boiling residues. Redistillation through the 30-cm Vigreux column and collection of the material boiling at 100\u2013102\u00b0C (30 mm), 95\u201397\u00b0C (19 mm), 89\u201391\u00b0C (16 mm), or 79\u201381\u00b0C (9 mm) gives colorless butenolide. In this way 170.2 g (41%) of pure butenolide is obtained.\nB. Furyl phosphorodichloridate. A 1-L flask, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube, is charged with 42 g (0.5 mol) of 2(5H)-furanone, 85 g (0.55 mol) of phosphoryl chloride, and 100 mL of methylene chloride. A solution of 65 g (0.5 mol) of ethyldiisopropylamine in 60 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise during 4 hr at ambient temperature (Note 9). The resulting mixture is stirred overnight (12 hr), after which 6.5 g of the amine in 10 mL of methylene chloride is added in one portion and stirring is continued for 20 hr (Note 10). The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and 200 mL of dry ether (Note 11) is added cautiously, followed by 100 mL of pentane (in that order), to the dark residue to precipitate the amine hydrochloride. The flask is stoppered and shaken for 1\u20132 min. The hydrochloride is filtered by suction and washed immediately with 100 mL of dry ether and 200 mL of pentane or petroleum ether (Note 12). The bottle is tightly stoppered and the filtrate is allowed to stand in the refrigerator (+4\u00b0C) overnight. The clear brown ethereal phase is decanted from a dark lower phase, and the solvent is evaporated. The residue (ca. 100 g) is distilled at the water pump. In order to obtain pure, color-stable, yellow dichloridate it is usually necessary to distill it twice. The first distillation is done rapidly, collecting the material that boils at 73\u201398\u00b0C (9 mm) to give 65\u201375 g of product, which usually darkens within a few days (Note 13) and (Note 14). Redistillation (Note 15), collecting the material that boils at 91\u201393\u00b0C (22 mm), 88\u201390\u00b0C (16 mm), or 73\u201376\u00b0C (9 mm), gives 60\u201365 g of pure product (Note 16). The yield is 60\u201365%.\nC. Furyl N,N,N',N'-tetramethyldiamidophosphate. To 180 mL of dry diethyl ether, chilled to \u221230\u00b0C, is added 56.7 g (4.2 equiv) (1.26 mmol) of dimethylamine (Note 17). This solution is added\u2014during 1\u20132 hr from a double-jacketed dropping funnel, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a cryostat regulated to \u221230\u00b0C\u2014to a stirred mixture (Note 18) of 60 g (0.30 mol) of the freshly distilled furyl phosphorodichloridate and 250 mL of ether in a two-necked, 1-L flask equipped with a condenser, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube and connected to the cryostat. This flask is chilled in an ice bath during the addition of the first 2 equiv of the dimethylamine. After the addition of dimethylamine is complete, stirring is continued for 20 hr while the mixture is warmed on a water bath at 35\u00b0C. The hydrochloride that forms is carefully filtered off with suction and washed with two 70-mL portions of dry ether. The combined ether phases are evaporated to give ca. 65 g (99%) of crude product. Distillation, discarding a yellow forerun and collecting the fraction boiling at 149\u2013152\u00b0C (20 mm) or 131\u2013134\u00b0C (7 mm) (Note 19), affords 52\u201358 g (79\u201388%) of pure material (Note 20).\nD. 3-Methyl-2(5H)-furanone. To 10.9 g (50 mmol) of furyl tetramethyldiamidophosphate in 90 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 21), chilled to \u221275\u00b0C, is added 21.9 mL (55 mmol) of a 2.51 M hexane solution of butyllithium (Note 22) at a rate (6\u201310 min) such that the temperature reaches \u221260\u00b0C but does not exceed this level. The resulting mixture is chilled to \u221275\u00b0C for 10 min; then 8.9 g (63 mmol) of methyl iodide in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added with a syringe during 7\u20138 min (Note 23) so that the temperature does not rise above \u221255\u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the temperature is raised to 0\u00b0C and the mixture is concentrated to ca. 40 mL. Water (30 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) are added, the phases are separated, and the dark inorganic phase is extracted with two 50-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined, yellow organic phases are washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated to give 10.5 g of crude 2-(3-methylfuryl) tetramethyldiamidophosphate, which need not be purified for the next reaction (Note 24).\nTo the phosphate in a 250-mL flask on a water bath at 25\u00b0C (Note 25) is added 20 mL of 98\u2013100% formic acid (Note 26), and the resulting mixture is stirred until bubbling has ceased (30\u201340 min). Benzene (50 mL) is added and most of the excess formic acid is removed on an evaporator. To the residue are added 50 mL of ethyl acetate and 30 mL of a sodium chloride\u2013sodium carbonate solution (Note 27). The organic phase is washed twice with the latter solution (i.e., a total of 3 \u00d7 20 mL), the combined inorganic phases are extracted once with 50 mL of ethyl acetate, the combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed, and the product is distilled to give 3.2 g (64%) of 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone, bp 97\u2013101\u00b0C (19 mm)."

To this stirred mixture, 25 g (0.23 mol) of cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) is added. The resulting mixture is then heated to reflux for 16 hr (Note 3), at which time the colorless solution has become brown-orange. At the end of this time the acetic acid is evaporated using a rotary evaporator (15 mm). Reduced-pressure distillation (74\u201384\u00b0C at 0.060 mm) yields 29.1\u201330.5 g (56\u201358%) of 2.6-diacetoxybicyclo[3.3.0]octane, as a pale-yellow liquid (lit.3 bp 84\u201388\u00b0C at 0.2 mm) (Note 4).\nB.

The cooled solution is slowly allowed to warm to room temperature (1 hr) and stirring is continued for 15 hr. at which time the colorless solution has become yellow-orange (Note 6).\nThe reaction mixture is then extracted continuously with ether for a 3 days. After extraction the ether is removed by rotary evaporation.

The stirred solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C under nitrogen and to it is added over 1 hr a solution of ethylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran (493 mL of 2.0 M solution, 0.986 mol) (Note 1). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is rapidly stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr, allowed to warm to room temperature for 1 hr, and then recooled to 0\u00b0C. To this mixture is slowly added over 30 min with rapid stirring freshly distilled (Note 3) chlorotrimethylsilane (125 mL, 0.986 mol). The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 0\u00b0C and allowed to warm to room temperature over 1\u20132 hr. The entire reaction mixture is poured slowly with rapid stirring into a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask that contains 1 L of ice-cold 3 M hydrochloric acid, and is stirred at 25\u00b0C for an additional 2 hr. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-mL portions of ether.\nThe combined organic phases are washed with two 200-mL portions of water, four 200-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and two 200-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature using a rotary evaporator. The crude product is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus under reduced pressure to give 45.2 g (0.318 mol, 71% yield) of 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-1-ol, bp 78\u201379\u00b0C (10 mm), as a colorless liquid (Note 4) and (Note 5).\nB. Preparation of (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-buten-1-ol. A dry, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask with a stirring bar is charged with 8.84 g (0.062 mol) of 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-1-ol, 0.4 g of 5% palladium on barium sulfate (Note 6), 0.45 g of synthetic quinoline (Note 7), and 78 mL of methanol. The flask is placed in a hydrogenation apparatus equipped with a gas burette, and the stirred mixture is thoroughly purged with nitrogen. The nitrogen is then replaced by hydrogen and the reaction mixture is stirred at atmospheric pressure and room temperature until 1.46 L (0.065 mol) of hydrogen is consumed. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and the solution is filtered through a thick pad of Celite. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at room temperature to afford 10\u201315 mL of an oil, which is diluted with 150 mL of ether. The ether solution is thoroughly washed once with 200 mL of ice-cold 0.2 M sulfuric acid, then once with 20 mL of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield 8.4 g (0.058 mol) of the crude buten-1-ol (Note 8). Short-path distillation under reduced pressure gives 7.60 g (0.0527 mol, 85% yield) of (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-buten-1-ol, bp 95\u2013100\u00b0C (25 mm) as a colorless liquid (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

            "A. Preparation of (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate. An oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and purged with dry argon or nitrogen. The flask is charged with 17.3 g (0.120 mol) of (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-buten-1-ol (Note 1) and 290 mL of dry pyridine (Note 2). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice\u2013water bath and 25.2 g (0.132 mol) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 3) is added to the solution. When the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is completely dissolved, the flask containing the reaction mixture is sealed and placed in a refrigerator at \u221220\u00b0C for 24 hr (Note 4). The reaction mixture is then poured into a rapidly stirring mixture of 200 g of ice and 200 mL of water contained in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask. The resulting mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with five 200-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with five 200-mL portions of ice-cold aqueous 6 N hydrochloric acid (Note 5) and 200 mL of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give 29.2 g (82%) of crude (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate as a light-yellow oil (Note 6).\nB. Preparation of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-(Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenamine. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 250-mL addition funnel, and a gas inlet tube. The flask is flushed with argon or nitrogen and charged with 41.5 g (0.337 mol) of 4-methoxyaniline (Note 7) and then heated to 65\u00b0C. The stirring melt is degassed (Note 8), 20.2 g (67.8 mmol) of (Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate is added over 15 min, and the resulting solution is maintained at 65\u00b0C for 3 hr. The reaction product is allowed to cool to ca. 50\u00b0C and is then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel using 250 mL of chloroform. The chloroform solution is washed with two 100-mL portions of 1 M sodium hydroxide and the combined aqueous phases are extracted with 500 mL of chloroform. The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The crude residue is distilled through a 17-cm Vigreux column and excess 4-methoxyaniline is collected in the first fraction, bp 80\u201386\u00b0C (0.25 mm) (Note 9). Vacuum distillation is continued to give 10.6 g (63% yield) of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-(Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenamine, bp 125\u2013128\u00b0C (0.25 mm), as a pale-yellow oil (Note 10).\nC. Preparation of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine. An oven-dried, 250-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and an argon or nitrogen inlet. The flask is flushed with argon or nitrogen, charged with 6.62 g (26.5 mmol) of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-(Z)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butenamine, 7.45 g (260 mmol) of paraformaldehyde (Note 11), 4.8 g (25 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 12), and 100 mL of acetonitrile (Note 13). The reaction mixture is degassed (Note 8) and heated at reflux for 1 hr (Note 14). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the excess paraformaldehyde is removed by vacuum filtration. The reaction vessel is washed with two 25-mL portions of dichloromethane and the washings are clarified by filtration. The combined organic phases are concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting solid residue is dissolved in dichloromethane and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with two 100-mL portions of 4 M sodium hydroxide and the aqueous washings are extracted with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are then washed with 100 mL of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The crude residue is dissolved in 9 : 1 hexane\u2013ether and filtered through a 20-cm column (6-cm diameter) of silica gel. Evaporation of solvent gives 4.2 g (84% yield) of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine as a white crystalline solid, mp 49\u201351\u00b0C (Note 15) and (Note 16)."

            "All apparatuses for Steps A and B should be dried overnight in an oven.\nA. 9,10-Dihydrofulvalene. A 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted, while hot, with a Hirschberg stirrer, gas inlet, and stopper (Note 1). The assembled apparatus is flame-dried and allowed to cool to room temperature under a stream of dry, oxygen-free argon (Note 2). The stopper is replaced with a powder funnel and, under a sweep of positive argon, 100 g (4.17 mol) of dry sodium hydride (Note 3) is added followed by 2.0 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 4). The powder funnel is replaced by a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing, jacketed addition funnel that is flushed with argon, then stoppered.\nThe stirred sodium hydride suspension is cooled by an external ice\u2013water bath and the jacket of the addition funnel is cooled in a dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath. Into the addition funnel is introduced 275 g (4.16 mol) of neat, freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (Note 5). The cyclopentadiene is added rapidly, dropwise over 30\u201340 min to the stirred slurry (Caution: Avoid excess foaming.) (Note 6). After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature.\nThe jacketed addition funnel is removed and 1.5 g of cuprous bromide\u2013dimethyl sulfide complex (Note 7) is added through a powder funnel. A 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel (long-tipped) is attached to the flask and flushed with argon. As the anion solution is cooled in a dry ice\u2013isopropyl alcohol bath, a solution of 530 g (2.08 mol) of sublimed iodine in 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is placed in the addition funnel. This solution is added dropwise to the cooled slurry over approximately 90 min (Note 8). The solution is stirred for about 15 min at low temperature.\nB. Diels\u2013Alder reaction. A 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing 330 g (2.32 mol) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (Note 9) is placed in the flask and the ester is added rapidly dropwise over 10 min. The solution is stirred for 30 min, the cooling bath is removed, and stirring is maintained for 4 hr (Note 10).\nThe reaction solution is filtered through a Celite pad (ca. 5 cm thick on a 32-cm B\u00fcchner funnel), and the solid is washed repeatedly with tetrahydrofuran (1.5 L). The combined filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure at a temperature not above 30\u00b0C. To the concentrate is added 1.5 L of ether. The solution is stirred for 15 min, again filtered through Celite, and concentrated at 30\u00b0C (Note 11).\nC. Hydrolysis. Into a three-necked, 5-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and 500-mL addition funnel with gas inlet is placed the above concentrate and 2 L of methanol. The solution is cooled to \u22125 to 0\u00b0C by means of an ice\u2013salt bath. A precooled (0\u00b0C) solution containing 220 g of 87.5% potassium hydroxide in 400 mL of water is added dropwise at such a rate as to keep the reaction temperature below 10\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hr at 0\u00b0C and for 1 hr at room temperature prior to the addition of 100 mL of glacial acetic acid. Solid sodium carbonate is added to bring the pH to 8 and the solution is filtered through Celite. Concentration off the filtrate at 35\u00b0C and reduced pressure affords about 1 L of a dark liquid. The liquid is diluted with 2 L of water and extracted with petroleum ether (6 \u00d7 600 mL). The combined extracts are washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (800 mL) and dried (magnesium sulfate). Concentration at 30\u00b0C affords a clear red liquid (occasionally a yellow solid) which is almost pure internal diester (Note 12).\nThe diester is dissolved in 130 mL of methanol, placed in a 1-L, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and reflux condenser, and treated with a solution containing 35 g of potassium hydroxide in 130 mL of water. The mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 1 hr. Methanol is removed under reduced pressure and 250 mL of water is added. Heating is continued for another 5 hr. After the solution is cooled, 5 g of activated charcoal is added and the mixture is stirred for 8 hr at room temperature. Filtration through Celite is followed by cooling of the stirred filtrate in an ice bath with acidification to pH 1 (dropwise addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid). The tan solid is isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature. On the average, the yield is 52\u201355 g (10\u201311%) but can vary from 42 to 68 g (8\u201313% yield) (Note 13)."

(1-Ethenyl)heptanyl 3-ketobutanoate. 3-Hydroxy-1-nonene ((Note 1), 7.5 g, 0.053 mol) is stirred in 250 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 2) in a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a thermometer, a nitrogen/mineral oil bubbler, a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum. A constant flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the reaction. To this clear homogeneous solution, diketene ((Note 3), 5.04 g, 0.060 mol) is added in one portion by syringe, followed by 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (0.591 g, 0.0049 mol, (Note 4)). A slightly exothermic reaction (to 32\u00b0C) is observed. After 15 min, the reaction is complete (Note 5). The reaction mixture is quenched with 100 mL of 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution and 100 mL of anhydrous ether. The layers are separated and the organic phase is washed once with 50 mL of 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution and once with brine. Drying over magnesium sulfate and concentration under reduced pressure affords 11.3 g (0.05 mol, 94%) of a pale-yellow oil. The \u03b2-keto ester is of high purity, as shown by TLC, GLC, and spectral analyses (Note 6); however, distillation (bp 113\u2013114\u00b0C/1.4 mm) leads to a colorless oil.\nB. 2-Carboxy-5-dodecen-2-one. A solution of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA, (Note 7)) in 150 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 8) is prepared from 0.199 mol (20.12 g) of diisopropylamine (Note 9) and 0.181 mol of butyllithium (Note 10) and (Note 11). The solution is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (acetone\u2013dry ice) and a solution of 10.0 g (0.044 mol) of (1-ethenyl)heptanyl 3-ketobutanoate in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 8) is added via a 12-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel at \u221278\u00b0C over a 15-min period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 45 min and is then allowed to warm gradually to room temperature. When the reaction mixture finally reaches 25\u00b0C (about 2 hr), it has a deep-red color. After the mixture is stirred for 18 hr at room temperature, the reaction is complete (Note 12). To this mixture, 100 mL of water and 100 mL of pentane are added in portions with stirring, maintaining the temperature below 25\u00b0C with an ice bath. As the deep-red reaction mixture is quenched, an orange heterogeneous mixture results. The layers are separated and the pentane layer is extracted 2 times with 50 mL of 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution (Note 13). All aqueous layers are combined in a 800-mL beaker equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar. A 100-mL aliquot of pentane is added to this aqueous mixture, which is stirred vigorously, and then 100 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid solution is added in 10-mL portions until pH 2 is reached (Note 14). The heterogeneous solution is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the layers are quickly separated. The aqueous layer is extracted 3 times more, each time with 50 mL of pentane. The combined organic layers (ca. 250\u2013300 mL) are dried (MgSO4), and evaporated at reduced pressure without heating, to give 9.6 g (0.04 mol, 97%) of a red-orange oil. This carboxylic acid is of high purity as shown by TLC and spectral analyses (Note 15).\nC. 5-Dodecen-2-one. The 3-carboxy-5-dodecen-2-one (9.0 g, 0.040 mol) is stirred in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride (Note 16) in a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that is fitted with a reflux condenser, a thermometer, a Teflon-covered magnetic stirrer, and a ground-glass stopper. After the orange-yellow solution is heated at reflux for 1 hr, TLC analysis shows the reaction to be complete (Note 17). The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure with warming to afford 7.1 g (0.039 mol, 98%) of a red-orange oil. The product is sufficiently pure for most purposes. It may be purified by vacuum distillation at 105\u2013107\u00b0C/2.7 mm (5.2 g, 0.03 mol, 71%), which yields a pale-yellow oil (Note 18)."

The suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 100 mL of 50% sodium hydroxide solution is added over 10 min from a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 24 hr and poured into 250 mL of water. The lower layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 25-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are washed with three 100-mL portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a brown-black oil. The oil is dissolved in an equal volume of hexane and filtered through a 2-in. bed of silica with hexane (1.5 L) as eluant. The solvent is evaporated and the orange oil is distilled in an apparatus protected from light (Note 4) at 85\u201395\u00b0C and 0.08 mm. The yellow distillate is redistilled through a 4-in.

A total of 2 L of anhydrous ether (Note 6) is transferred into the flask via cannula. The stirred solution is cooled in an ice bath and 147 mL of 1.5 M methyllithium in ether (220 mmol) is introduced via a second cannula (Note 7). The ice bath is removed and stirring is maintained for 10 hr before the solution is transferred by cannula into 1 L of ice-cold water. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried and concentrated (Note 8). The residual yellow oil is immediately diluted with an equal volume of hexane and passed through a short column of neutral alumina (Note 9). The solvent is carefully removed and the yellow oil is subjected to bulb-to-bulb distillation at 90\u00b0C and 5 mm (Note 10).

A solution of benzylamine (172 g, 1.6 mol) (Note 1) and 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane (18.7 g, 0.1 mol) (Note 2) is stirred and heated at 120\u00b0C for 28 hr. The reaction is cooled to room temperature, sodium hydroxide pellets (8.0 g, 0.2 mol) are added, and the mixture is heated at 120\u00b0C, with stirring, for 1 hr. The reaction is cooled and excess benzylamine is removed by vacuum distillation (Note 3) using a water aspirator (Note 4). The resulting oil is dissolved in chloroform (100 mL), filtered, and washed with water (50 mL) to remove salts. The organic phase is dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Bulb-to-bulb distillation using a Kugelrohr apparatus (175\u2013177\u00b0C, 0.2 mm) gives 27.9\u201331.2 g (85\u201395%) of 1,10-dibenzyl-4,7-dioxa-1,10-diazadecane (Note 5) as a slightly yellow oil that is sufficiently pure to be used for the preparation of N,N'-dibenzyl-4,13-diaza-18-crown-6.\nB.

Preparation of \"precursor.\" A mixture of 100 g (0.666 mol) of p-tert-butylphenol, 62 mL of 37% formaldehyde solution (0.83 mol of HCHO), and 1.2 g (0.03 mol) of sodium hydroxide (corresponding to 0.045 equiv with respect to phenol) (Note 1) in 3 mL of water is placed in a 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The contents of the open flask are allowed to stir for 15 min at room temperature, and then heated for 2 hr at 100\u2013120\u00b0C by means of a heating mantle (Note 2). The reaction mixture, which is clear and colorless at the beginning, becomes light yellow after 30 min, a somewhat deeper yellow after 2 hr, and eventually changing to a thick slurry as the water evaporates and finally turning to a deep yellow or brown-yellow very viscous mass. During this period there is considerable frothing, and the reaction mixture fills most of the flask before shrinking back to the original volume. Stirring is discontinued, the reaction vessel is removed from the heating mantle, and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. To dissolve the residue 800\u20131000 mL of warm diphenyl ether (Note 3) is added to the flask and the contents are stirred, the process generally requiring at least 1 hr.\nB. Pyrolysis of the precursor. The 3-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The contents of the flask are stirred and heated (110\u2013120\u00b0C) with a heating mantle while a stream of nitrogen is blown rapidly over the reaction mixture to facilitate the removal of the water as it is evolved. During this period the color of the solution changes from yellow to a gray or a light brown. When the evolution of water subsides and a solid starts to form (prior to attaining the reflux temperature) (Note 4), the flask is fitted with a condenser, and the contents of the flask are stirred and heated to ca. 150\u2013160\u00b0C (Note 5) for a few minutes and then at reflux for 3\u20134 hr under a gentle flow of nitrogen (Note 6). During this phase of the reaction the solid dissolves, and a clear dark-brown to grayish-black solution is formed. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature (some solid separates), and the product is precipitated by the addition of 1.5 L of ethyl acetate. The resulting mixture is stirred for 15\u201330 min and allowed to stand for at least 30 min (Note 7). Filtration yields material that is washed twice with 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate, once with 200 mL of acetic acid, twice with 100-mL portions of water, and twice with 50-mL portions of acetone to yield ca. 66 g (61%) of crude product (Note 8). The white-to-beige-colored crude product is dissolved in ca. 1600\u20131800 mL of boiling toluene that is concentrated to ca. 700\u2013900 mL. On cooling, 61 g (49%) of product is obtained as glistening white rhombic crystals, mp 342\u2013344\u00b0C (Note 9) and (Note 10)."

To the flask are added 100 g (0.665 mol) of p-tert-butylphenol, 135 mL of 37% formalin solution (1.8 mol of HCHO), and 15 g (0.227 mol) of potassium hydroxide pellets (corresponding to 0.34 equiv of the phenol) (Note 2) and (Note 3). Heating and stirring are begun, and after 15 min nitrogen is blown across the reaction mixture at a brisk rate and out through the condenser on top of the Dean\u2013Stark trap (Note 4); the reaction mixture is heated and stirred for 2 hr (Note 5). As the reaction progresses, the originally clear solution turns bright lemon yellow and, as water is removed, the reaction mixture eventually changes to a thick, golden-yellow mass of taffylike consistency (Note 6). During this period some frothing occurs, and the reaction mixture expands somewhat before shrinking to the original volume. Xylene (1 L) is now added to the flask to dissolve the semisolid mass and give a yellow solution that is brought quickly to reflux by increasing the temperature of the heating mantle (Note 7). After 30 min a precipitate begins to form, and the color of the reaction mixture changes from yellow to orange. Refluxing is continued for 3 hr, the heating mantle is removed, and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is filtered, and the precipitate is washed with xylene and dried on a B\u00fcchner funnel to yield 105\u2013110 g of crude, almost colorless product.

The chloroform layer is drawn off, the aqueous layer is extracted with an additional 250 mL of chloroform, and the combined chloroform extracts are washed once with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration, the chloroform solution is concentrated to ca. 1 L by boiling, and 1 L of hot acetone is added to the boiling chloroform solution.

            "A. Racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol. A 3-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with 35.3 g (1.47 g-atom) of magnesium turnings (Note 1) and 170 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this stirred mixture a solution of 155 mL (1.47 mol) of bromobenzene (Note 2) in 250 mL of dry THF is added dropwise over a 1.5-hr period (Note 3) and (Note 4). After the addition of bromobenzene is complete, 1 L of dry THF is added. The solution is cooled to \u221230\u00b0C (dry ice\u2013nitromethane slush bath) and 6.53 g (0.066 mol) of purified (Note 5) copper(I) chloride is added. The resulting mixture is stirred for 10 min, and then a solution of 101 mL (1.0 mol) of cyclohexene oxide (Note 6) in 100 mL of THF is added dropwise over a 1.5-hr period. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C and stirred for 2 hr, then quenched by adding 500 mL of saturated ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] solution (aqueous). The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with 100 mL of saturated (NH4)2SO4 (Note 7). The combined aqueous layers are extracted with ether, the organic layers are combined and dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent is removed via rotary evaporator to give 175.5 g (99.6% crude) of the desired product as a light-yellow solid. The solid is recrystallized from pentane to give 142.3 g (80%), mp 55.5\u201357.0\u00b0C (lit.3 57\u201358\u00b0C) (Note 8).\nB. Racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser is charged with 100 g (0.567 mol) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol, 50 mL (0.625 mol) of chloroacetyl chloride (Note 9), 300 mg (0.0025 mol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (Note 10), and 250 mL of dichloromethane. This mixture is rapidly stirred and heated at reflux for 6 hr. The mixture is cooled and a solution of 350 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate is carefully added to the rapidly stirring mixture (Note 11). Stirring is maintained for 3 hr (Note 12). The organic layer is separated and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30\u00b0C) to a dark-brown oil. This oil is distilled through a 2- or 4-in. column packed with glass beads to give, after collecting a small forerun (ca. 2 g), 135 g (94%) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate as a colorless liquid, bp 118\u2013122\u00b0C at 0.3 mm.\nC. (\u2212)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-Phenylcyclohexanol. A 500-mL, three-necked Morton flask (Note 13) equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pH probe (connected to a pH controller, (Note 14)), and a base inlet (connected to a syringe pump regulated by the pH controller and a calibrated 250-mL reservoir (Note 15) of 1 N sodium hydroxide) is charged with 106.0 g (0.419 mol) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate, 10 mL of pH 7 buffer (Note 16), and 90 mL of deionized water. This heterogeneous mixture is rapidly stirred and heated to between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C using a constant temperature bath. The pH is adjusted to 7.5 with 1 N sodium hydroxide and after a steady pH reading is achieved (Note 17), 1 g of lipase (P. fluorescens, (Note 18)) is added. Immediately 1 N sodium hydroxide begins to flow into the reaction mixture as the pH begins to drop (indicating hydrolysis of the chloroacetate). The pH controller regulates the addition of base so as to maintain the pH between 7.5 and 7.8. After 2 hr, an additional 1.5 g of lipase is added to the reaction mixture and the rate of hydrolysis becomes noticeably faster (Note 19). After 45 hr, ca. 200 mL (~ 95% of theory) of 1 N sodium hydroxide has been added and the rate of hydrolysis has become very slow. After ca. 50 hr, 210 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide (0.21 mol, 100% of theory) has been added to the mixture and the rate of base addition has nearly stopped (Note 20). The mixture is cooled to room temperature and extracted with three 200-mL portions of ether. The organic layer is filtered through a small pad of Celite to remove traces of enzyme emulsion and the Celite is rinsed with three 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and after filtration are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35\u00b0C) and finally dried at 0.5 mm for 1 hr to give 93 g of a colorless oil. Fractional crystallization from 100 mL of petroleum ether (30\u201360\u00b0C) at \u221220\u00b0C (freezer) overnight affords 19.8 g (53.5% of theory, (Note 21)) of (\u2212)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol as colorless needles, mp 63\u201365\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 \u221254.3\u00b0 (methanol, c 18). An additional 15.8 g of the (\u2212) alcohol is obtained by chromatography of the mother liquors (vide infra) to afford a total of 35.6 g (96.2% of theory, (Note 21) and (Note 22)).\nThe mother liquors are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35\u00b0C) to give a colorless oil that is redissolved in 100 mL of hexanes and poured onto a 250-g pad of silica gel (Note 23) contained in a 500-mL sintered-glass funnel, preequilibrated with hexanes. Using this simple silica pad, 100-mL fractions are collected, diluting first with 1 L of hexanes, followed by 3 L of 9:1 hexanes: ethyl acetate, and finally with 600 mL of ethyl acetate. After TLC analysis of the eluants (Note 24), fractions 3\u201318 are combined and concentrated initially on a rotary evaporator (40\u00b0C) and finally dried at 0.5 mm to afford 52.0 (98% of theory) of (\u2212)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate as a colorless oil, [\u03b1]D25 \u221214.3\u00b0 (benzene, c 10). Fractions 20\u201328 are combined and concentrated as above to afford 15.8 g of the (\u2212)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol, mp 62\u201365\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 \u221254.9\u00b0 (methanol, c 2.1).\nD. (+)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-Phenylcyclohexanol. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with a mixture of 52.0 g (0.206 mol) of (\u2212)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate, 250 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide, and 100 mL of methanol and then stirred at reflux for 3 hr. TLC analysis (Note 24) indicates complete reaction. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, adjusted to pH 7 with ca. 35 mL of 3 N sulfuric acid and poured into 500 mL of water. The mixture is extracted with two 150-mL portions of dichloromethane and the organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35\u00b0C) to afford 37.0 g of a colorless solid. Recrystallization from 100 mL of petroleum ether (30\u201360\u00b0C) at \u221220\u00b0C gives in two crops, 35.8 g (96% of theory) of (+)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol as colorless needles, mp 60\u201362\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D25 + 52.8\u00b0 (methanol, c 5.4) (Note 25)."

            "For preparation of ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate (Note 1), a 1-L flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, condenser and a gas adapter is charged under an atmosphere of argon with 38.5 g of acetamide and 80 g (0.36 mol) of ethyl 2-bromohexanoate (Note 2). The mixture is heated to 80\u00b0C until solution is effected and 38.6 g (0.65 mol) of potassium fluoride (Note 3) is added to it followed by 2.7 mL of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (Note 4). The resulting mixture is heated at 140\u00b0C with rapid stirring for 4\u20135 (Note 5). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 90\u00b0C and then is poured into 600 mL of ice. The reaction flask is rinsed with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of dichloromethane, which are added to the ice mixture. The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (4 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The dichloromethane solution is then cooled to 5\u00b0C and treated under an atmosphere of argon with 15 mL of bromine (Note 6). The reaction is judged complete after ca. 3 hr. It is quenched by adding 200 mL of saturated sodium thiosulfate solution. The two phases are separated and the organic phase is successively partitioned with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (2 \u00d7 150 mL) and then with 200 mL of brine. It is finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to an oil at 40\u00b0C / 7 mm (Note 7). Vacuum distillation at 36\u201337\u00b0C / 0.8-0.9 mm affords 26.2\u201331.4 g (45\u201354% yield) of pure ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate as a colorless liquid (Note 8).\nMethod A. Enantiomerically pure ethyl (R)-2-fluorohexanoate (60% hydrolysis). A 1-L Morton flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a glass baffle, an electrode connected to a pH control unit, and an addition tube connected to a syringe pump is charged with 300 mL of 0.05 M aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (Fisher), 300 mL of deionized water, and 70 g (0.43 mol) of ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate. The resulting mixture is stirred for several minutes and the pH is adjusted to 7.0 with the addition of a few drops of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution. Then 0.43 g of Pseudomonas lipase enzyme (P-30, Amano International Enzyme Co., Inc., Troy, VA) is added and the hydrolysis is allowed to proceed at 5\u00b0C with stirring (reaction time ca. 2 hr). The pH is kept constant at 7.0 by adding 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution via the syringe pump, which is activated by the pH control unit. The hydrolysis is discontinued when 260 mL of 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution has been added (60% conversion, (Note 9)). The mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated at 40\u00b0C / 70 mm. Vacuum distillation at 36\u201338\u00b0C / 0.7\u20130.8 mm gives 24.0 g (34% yield, 85% of theory, (Note 10)) of pure ethyl (R)-2-fluorohexanoate, which is 97.5\u201399% enantiomerically pure, [\u03b1]D25 + 13.0 to + 13.2\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 1.3) (Note 9). The aqueous layer is acidified to pH 2 with 3 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at 40\u00b0C / 70 mm.

The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with a few drops of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and 23 mg of Pseudomonas lipase enzyme (P-30, Amano International) is added to the mixture. The hydrolysis is allowed to proceed at 5\u201310\u00b0C with stirring. The pH is maintained at 7.0 by adding adequate 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution via the syringe pump. The hydrolysis is discontinued when 197 mL (40% conversion) of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution has been added (total reaction time: 2.5 hr). The reaction mixture is immediately transferred to an extractor containing 750 mL of ethyl ether. The mixture is agitated for 5 min and the two phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 400 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated at 30\u00b0C/70 mm to afford 47.2 g (98% of theory) of optically active ethyl (R)-2-fluorohexanoate. The aqueous phase is transferred back into the extractor and carefully acidified to pH 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It is subsequently extracted with diethyl ether (4 \u00d7 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated at 30\u00b0C/70 mm to provide 26.1 g (39% yield; 98% of theory) of (S)-2-fluorohexanoic acid (81\u201386% ee).\nOPTICAL PURITY ENHANCEMENT. A 1-L, three-necked flask equipped as described above is charged with 28.4 g (0.175 mol) of ethyl (S)-2-fluorohexanoate (81% ee) (Note 12), 300 mL of deionized water and 300 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with a few drops of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 36 mg of Pseudomonas lipase enzyme (P-30, Amano International) is added to the mixture. The hydrolysis is allowed to proceed at 5\u00b0C. The pH is kept at 7.0 by adding adequate 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution via the syringe pump. The hydrolysis is discontinued when 131.3 mL (75% conversion) of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution has been added (total reaction time: 4 hr). The mixture is quickly extracted with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and concentrated at 35\u00b0C/70 mm to provide 5.66 g of nearly racemic ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate. The aqueous phase is acidified to pH 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl ether (4 \u00d7 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated at 35\u00b0C/70 mm to give 16.8 g (71% yield; 95.5% of theory) of (S)-2-fluorohexanoic acid.

            "A. (1R,2r,3S)-2-Nitrocyclohexane-1,3-diol. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and an ice\u2013ethanol bath is charged with 175 mL (0.455 mol) of an aqueous 25% solution of glutaric dialdehyde, 38 mL (0.708 mol) of nitromethane, and 600 mL of methanol (Note 1). At 0\u20135\u00b0C 12 mL of aqueous 2 M sodium hydroxide is added gradually. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hr at room temperature. The resulting yellow solution is neutralized by adding 15 g of acidic cation-exchange resin and stirring for an additional 20 min (Note 2). The resin is filtered off and washed with a small volume of methanol. The filtrate is evaporated to a semisolid residue using reduced pressure and a 35\u00b0C water bath. The residue is dissolved in 100 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol with heating and diluted by gradual addition of 250 mL of toluene. The resulting two-phase mixture (Note 3) is again evaporated, with azeotropic removal of water. The resulting residue is again taken up in 100 mL of hot ethyl alcohol and diluted with 250 mL of toluene (Note 3). The almost colorless crystals are filtered and dried at high vacuum to yield 44\u201352 g (60\u201370%) of nitrodiol, mp 152\u2013155\u00b0C (dec).\nB. (1R,2r,3S)-3-Acetoxy-2-nitrocyclohexyl acetate. In a 1-L flask 52 g (0.323 mol) of the nitrodiol are suspended in 150 mL of acetic anhydride. Without cooling, 3\u20136 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are added (Note 4). After 1 hr 500 mL of ice/water is rapidly added and stirring is continued for 60 min. The resulting colorless crystals are filtered, washed with water, and air-dried. The product thus obtained, 75.6 g (95.6%) of colorless crystals, is pure by TLC (4 : 1 hexane/ethyl acetate) and NMR, and melts at 89\u201390\u00b0C (Note 5).\nC.

A 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 10 g (41 mmol) of powdered nitrodiacetate and 300 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 prepared by dissolving 11 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 3.3 g of potassium hydroxide in 300 mL of deionized (or distilled) water. To the stirred suspension is added 30 mg of purified PLE [Esterase (EC 3.1.1.1), suspended in 2.8 mL of 3.2 M ammonium sulfate buffer] (Note 6) and the mixture is stirred for 24 to 48 hr (Note 7). The continuously measured pH drops to about 5.6 during the reaction and then remains almost constant, while the mixture has turned to a practically clear, pale-yellow solution (Note 8). The solution is filtered through a paper filter and the filtrate is extracted 3 times with 100 mL of ether. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Removal of the solvent and of the acetic acid under reduced pressure leaves 7\u20138 g (85\u201395%) of colorless monoacetate as a crystalline solid (Note 9). Recrystallization by dissolving in 100 mL of ether and adding 250 mL of pentane gives 5\u20136 g (60\u201370%) of pure (1S,2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-nitrocyclohexyl acetate (Note 10), mp 90\u201391\u00b0C, [\u03b1]D + 9.5\u00b0 (CHCl3, c 1.0) (Note 11).

Diels\u2013Alder-adduct rac-3.2 A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a calcium-sulfate-filled drying tube, a nitrogen inlet, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 2,2-diamethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione 2 (Meldrum's acid) ((Note 1), 10.0 g, 69.4 mmol), a catalytic amount of ethylenediammonium diacetate (EDDA) ((Note 2), 500 mg, 2.77 mmol) and dry methanol (150 mL). (R,S)-Citronellal (rac-1, Sigma; dried over MgSO4 and distilled) ((Note 3), 9.74 g = 11.4 mL, 63.1 mmol) is added under nitrogen (Note 4) over 15 min through the dropping funnel to the well-stirred mixture while the temperature is kept at 15\u201320\u00b0C by cooling the flask with a water bath. The solution is stirred for an additional 45 min at room temperature, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (25\u00b0C), and the remaining yellow oil is dissolved in diethyl ether (300 mL). The organic layer is washed with water (50 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 \u00d7 50 mL) and brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration and removal of the solvent gives an 8 : 1 mixture (16.5 g) of the Diels\u2013Alder adduct rac-3 and the ene-product rac-4 as a yellow oil (Note 5).\nB. Lactone 5. The crude mixture of rac-3 and rac-4 is dissolved in 300 mL of dry methanol (distilled from sodium) containing 10 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated under reflux for about 8 hr until the reactants can no longer be detected by thin-layer chromatography (Note 6). The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 25\u00b0C and the remaining residue, which consists of an 8 : 1 mixture of lactone rac-5 and dimethyl ester rac-6, is dissolved in dry dichloromethane (50 mL). The solution is acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (10 mL) and stirred at room temperature for about 48 hr, until the thin-layer chromatogram does not show any dimethyl ester rac-6 (Note 6). The organic layer is washed with water (50 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (2 \u00d7 50 mL), water (50 mL), and brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the remaining thick, yellow oil under reduced pressure in a short-path distillation apparatus with an air-cooled condenser gives 12.6 g (79%) of rac-5, bp 133\u2013135\u00b0C at 0.001 mm. The colorless oil is dissolved in tert-butyl methyl ether (10 mL) and hexane (80 mL) and the solvent is allowed to evaporate over 2 days to about 15% of the original volume. Lactone rac-5 (8.11 g, 53%) slowly crystallizes (mp 69\u201371\u00b0C) (Note 7) and (Note 8). If the above procedure is repeated with the mother liquor, a variable additional amount of rac-5 (Note 8) is obtained.\nWith (S)-citronellal the (4S,4aS,6S,8aS)-lactone (+)-5 is obtained; with (R)-citronellal the (4R,4aR,6R,8aR)-lactone (\u2212)-5 is obtained (Note 3) and (Note 7)."

A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 200 mL of acetic acid, 5.1 g (0.12 mol) of lithium chloride, 12.2 g (0.12 mol) of lithium acetate dihydrate, 0.67 g (3 mmol) of palladium acetate, and 12.9 g (0.12 mol) of p-benzoquinone. The contents of the flask are stirred at room temperature until all components are dissolved, and 300 mL of pentane is added. To the pentane phase of the biphasic system formed is added 4.82 g (60 mmol) of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (Note 1). The reaction mixture is stirred at a moderate rate (Note 2) at room temperature and after 4 hr, 2.87 g (33 mmol) of manganese dioxide (Note 3) is added. After the flask is stirred for another 4 hr at room temperature, the organic phase is separated and saved, and 2.87 g (33 mmol) of manganese dioxide and 20 mL of acetic acid are added to the remaining acetic acid, which is vigorously stirred for 30 min. To the mixture are added 2.6 g (60 mmol) of lithium chloride and 300 mL of pentane. A new portion of 4.82 g (60 mmol) of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is added and the reaction mixture is stirred at a moderate rate (Note 1) at room temperature overnight (12\u201315 hr). To the reaction mixture is added 70 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and the organic phase is separated and saved. The aqueous phase is filtered and extracted with pentane (2 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (2 \u00d7 120 mL), 120 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, 120 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide, 120 mL of water, and 120 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure, giving 16.5\u201317.5 g (79\u201384%) of a yellow oil. Kugelrohr distillation (95\u2013105\u00b0C, 1 mm) of the crude product affords 14.6\u201315.6 g (71\u201375%) of pure cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene (>98% cis). Analysis by HPLC and GLC [high-performance (pressure) liquid and gas chromatograph] shows about 1% contamination of diacetate as the only impurity. No dichloride can be detected (<0.5%).\nB. cis-1-Acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene. A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and a rubber septum is charged with 17.5 g (0.1 mol) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene, 0.49 g (2.2 mol) of palladium acetate and 2.4 g (9.0 mmol) of triphenylphosphine (Note 4). The flask is flushed with nitrogen (Note 5). To the flask is added 550 mL of a 0.2 M solution (0.11 mol) of sodium dimethyl malonate in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by syringe (Note 6). The flask is again flushed with nitrogen and the reaction mixture, which now has turned yellow, is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr (Note 7). The flask is opened and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added. The stirring is continued for 20 min, and then 100 mL of water and 200 mL of ether are added. The contents of the flask are transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated. The remaining aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 300 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with 200 mL of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 400 mL, and then filtered through a short silica gel column (Note 8). Removal of the rest of the solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure gives 30.4\u201331.3 g of a light-brown oil. Excess dimethyl malonate is removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 100\u00b0C (1 mm). Kugelrohr distillation (140\u00b0C, 0.2 mm) of the remaining crude product affords 25.9\u201326.7 g (91%) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene as a light-brown oil. Analysis by GLC indicates a chemical purity of 95\u201398%.\nC. trans-1-Acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene. In a 1-L, two-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a nitrogen gas inlet, and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 8.73 g (50 mmol) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene and 400 mL of a 0.18 M solution (72 mmol) of sodium dimethyl malonate in acetonitrile (Note 9). The flask is flushed with nitrogen and then heated in an oil bath at reflux for 21 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and 5 g of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is added. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr, poured into 800 mL of ether, and the resulting mixture is filtered. The organic phase is collected and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford 16.1 g of the product together with dimethyl malonate. The excess dimethyl malonate is removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 70\u00b0C (0.2 mm). The residual crude yellow oil was dissolved in a minimal amount of ethyl acetate and passed through a short silica plug (30\u201335g, Alfa silica) gel (53 \u03bcm) eluting with a small amount of fresh ethyl acetate. Removal of ethyl acetate on a rotary evaporator and further concentration at 0.2 mm overnight yielded 11.6\u201312.2 g (86\u201390%) of trans-1-acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene as a clear oil, essentially pure (99% by GLC) (Note 10)."

A 1.68 M hexane solution of butyllithium (60 mL, 0.10 mol) (Note 3) is added dropwise with stirring over a 10-min period, and the stirring is continued for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C. To the resulting lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution is added dropwise 14.1 g (0.100 mol) of propanoylpiperidine (Note 4) with stirring over a 10-min period, and the stirring is continued for 2 hr at \u221278\u00b0C (Note 15).

The balloon is taken off and nitrogen is passed through the two stopcocks so that the reaction mixture does not come in contact with air (see the apparatus shown in Fig. 1). By inclining the first flask, the THF solution of the lithium enolate of 1-propanoylpiperidine is added to the THF solution of benzoyl chloride in the second flask through the polyvinyl chloride tube over a 5-min period. After the solution is stirred for 0.5 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, it is allowed to warm to room temperature, diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane, and washed with 200 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether.

The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 200 mL of water. After the organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Note 10). The crude oil is placed in a 200-mL, one-necked flask and dissolved in 100 mL of methanolic 1 M sodium hydroxide. The solution is stirred for 1.5 hr at ambient temperature with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether.

The solution is kept for 5 min at this temperature.\nThe lithium diisopropylamide solution prepared as described above is transferred dropwise, via a cannula, into the bicyclic lactam solution. The dry ice\u2013acetone bath is replaced by an ice\u2013water bath, where the reaction mixture is kept for 40 min to complete formation of the lithium enolate. The reaction mixture is cooled again (30 min) with a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. Freshly distilled ethyl iodide (25.8 g, 13.4 mL, 165.4 mmol) (Note 9) is added slowly, via syringe, to the mixture and stirring is continued for 55 min in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. The cooling bath is replaced by an ice\u2013water bath, and the mixture is stirred for exactly 40 min (Note 10) and is poured immediately into a separatory funnel containing 400 mL of 1.0 N hydrochloric acid. The resulting emulsion is extracted once with 400 mL of ether and the organic layer is washed with 200 mL of a 1 : 1 mixture of brine and a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. The ether extract is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The residue is dissolved in 60 mL of dry toluene and evaporated again using a water bath (60\u00b0C for 45 min) to remove all traces of water and toluene. The product (17.2 g, > 100%) is used in the next step without further purification.\nThe 500-mL flask containing the crude dry product (17.2 g) is filled with argon and dry tetrahydrofuran (150 mL), a magnetic stirring bar is added, the flask is sealed with a rubber septum, and argon is introduced once again. The flask is gently swirled until the viscous oil is totally dissolved and then the flask is immersed in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath.\nAnother portion of LDA is prepared as described above except that this time 12.6 g of diisopropylamine (17.6 mL, 124.6 mmol) in THF (50 mL) and 78.0 mL (124.8 mmol) of 1.6 M butyllithium/hexane are used. The LDA solution is added, through a cannula, to the ethylated bicyclic lactam solution and the mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C; it is kept at this temperature for 3.0 hr (Note 11). The solution is cooled to \u221275\u00b0 to \u221280\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. A solution of 9.4 g of freshly distilled allyl bromide (6.8 mL, 77.6 mmol) (Note 12) in dry THF (50 mL) is prepared in a 100-mL, oven-dried conical flask flushed with argon and sealed with a rubber septum. This solution is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and slowly added to the reaction mixture through a cannula (Note 13). After addition of the allyl bromide, the mixture is kept in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath for 2.5 hr; then the bath is replaced by acetone at \u221250\u00b0C, which is allowed to warm to \u221230\u00b0C within a period of 45 min (Note 14). The reaction is terminated by pouring it into 1 N hydrochloric acid (as above), extracting with ether, washing with sodium bicarbonate\u2013brine, drying over magnesium sulfate, and evaporating the solvents. The viscous or solid residue is dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL), and petroleum ether (30\u201360\u00b0C) (140 mL) is added. The product is allowed to crystallize at room temperature for 1 hr, then at \u221215\u00b0C overnight, to give 13.5 g (74%, mp 90\u201392\u00b0C) of a 9 : 1 mixture of diastereoisomers.\nThis mixture is recrystallized three times with the same mixture of solvents and the product is collected after 1 hr at 0\u00b0C to give 8.7 g (47.9%, mp 101\u2013103\u00b0C) of a 25 : 1 mixture of diastereoisomers (values based on the 8a-methyl signal integration on NMR spectra) (Note 15).\nC. (R)-4-Ethyl-4-allyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. In an oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, containing dry toluene (300 mL) and a magnetic stirring bar, is placed the dialkylated lactam (7.8 g, 23.7 mmol). The solution is cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath and a 1 M solution of Red-Al in toluene (55 mL, 55.0 mmol) is slowly added (Note 16). The flask is flushed with argon and sealed with a rubber septum which is connected by a hypodermic needle to a rubber balloon filled with argon. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 3 days. The septum is removed, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C, and methanol (10 mL) is cautiously added with stirring to destroy excess Red-Al. The solution is poured over 1 M aqueous potassium hydroxide (500 mL) in a 2-L separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken with ether (200 mL) until both layers become almost clear. The aqueous layer is extracted twice more with ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL), and, after the ethereal layers are combined, the ethereal solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in a 500-mL flask.\nThe residue is dissolved in ethanol (250 mL), a 1 M aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (80 mL) (Note 17) is added, and the mixture is stirred under reflux for 24 hr. After the solution is cooled, it is partly evaporated on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature not exceeding 40\u00b0C (Note 18) to remove most of the ethanol. Water is added (500 mL) and the solution is extracted twice with chloroform (200 mL). The chloroform extracts are washed with a 1 : 1 mixture of brine and 1 N hydrochloric acid and then with brine and saturated sodium bicarbonate solutions. Both aqueous phases are extracted twice with chloroform and the extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness to give 5.8 g of crude 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexenone. The product is distilled rapidly in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 3.5 mm and 115\u00b0C to give 3.0 g (77%) of highly pure cyclohexenone (Note 19)."

The mixture is flushed with nitrogen and brought to reflux with a hot oil bath. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained over the well-stirred reaction mixture during this and the ensuing steps. Meanwhile, a solution of 1.64 g (10 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and 16.0 g (55 mmol) of tributylstannane in 90 mL of anhydrous toluene is prepared and filtered if necessary (Note 2). This solution is added to the refluxing, well-stirred reaction mixture during 6 hr by a syringe pump through a long needle that pierces the septum and ends at least 3 cm above the lower end of the cooling zone of the reflux condenser (Note 3). Ten minutes after all of the solution is added, the reaction mixture is cooled and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator (bath 40\u00b0C); 100 mL of hexane and 100 mL of acetonitrile are added, and the resulting two-phase solution is stirred vigorously for 5 min and then transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower, acetonitrile layer is separated and the hexane phase washed with 10 mL of acetonitrile (Note 4). This extraction of the combined acetonitrile solutions is repeated twice using 100 mL of hexane each time. The combined acetonitrile phases are then filtered and distilled (rotary evaporator, bath temp. 40\u00b0C). Coevaporation with 40 mL of hexane yields crude solid material that is dissolved in 120 mL of boiling tert-butyl methyl ether. Then 30 mL of hexane is added and the mixture is left for 4 hr at room temperature. To complete crystallization of the product, another 20 mL of hexane is added and the mixture is kept for 12 hr at 5\u00b0C. The long, colorless needles are filtered and washed once with 30 mL of hexane/tert-butyl methyl ether (2:1) and two times with 30 mL of pentane to yield 13.2\u201313.4 g (79\u201381%) of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranose, mp 109\u2013110\u00b0C; [\u03b1]D20 + 113\u00b0C (C2H5OH, c 1.2)."

To a 250-mL round-bottomed flask (Note 1) equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added 5.0 g (20.0 mmol) of titanocene dichloride [bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride] (Note 2). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which a large-gauge needle is passed to flush the system with dry nitrogen. After the vessel has been thoroughly purged, the nitrogen line flowing to the needle is opened to a mineral oil bubbler and 20 mL of a trimethylaluminum solution (2.0 M in toluene, 40 mmol) is added by a nitrogen-purged syringe (Note 3). Methane gas evolved by the reaction is allowed to vent as the resulting red solution is stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The Tebbe reagent3 thus formed is used in situ by cooling the mixture in an ice-water bath (Note 4), then adding 4.0 g (20 mmol) of phenyl benzoate (Note 5) dissolved in 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 6) by syringe or cannula to the cooled stirring solution over 5\u201310 min. After the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for about 30 min. The septum is removed and 50 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added. To the stirring reaction mixture is gradually added 50 drops of an aqueous solution of 1 M sodium hydroxide over 10\u201320 min (Note 7). Stirring is continued until gas evolution essentially ceases; then to the resulting orange slurry are added a few grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove excess water. The mixture is filtered through a Celite pad on a large coarse frit using suction and liberal amounts of diethyl ether to transfer the product and rinse the filter pad. Concentration of the filtrate with a rotary evaporator (Note 8) to 5\u20138 mL provides crude product, which is purified by column chromatography on basic alumina (150 g) eluting with 10% diethyl ether in pentane (Note 9). Fractions that contain product (Note 10) are combined and evaporated to give 2.69\u20132.79 g (68\u201370%) of the desired enol ether (Note 11) as a pale-yellow oil.\nB. 3,4-Dihydro-2-methylene-2H-1-benzopyran.

The resulting light-yellow solution is warmed to \u221220\u00b0C using a solid dry ice\u2013carbon tetrachloride bath and stirred for 20 min.\nA 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with copper(I) cyanide (2.95 g, 33.0 mmol, (Note 5)). The flask is evacuated and gently flame-dried under vacuum (Note 6), then flushed with dry argon. The process is repeated 3 times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (33 mL) is injected and the resulting slurry is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. At this time, the previously prepared solution of 2-lithiothiophene in tetrahydrofuran (at \u221220\u00b0C) is added via cannula to the stirring slurry. At the end of the addition, the acetone\u2013dry ice bath is exchanged for an ice bath. After 5 min (Note 7), the flask is again placed in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. Vinyllithium in tetrahydrofuran (16.7 mL, 1.98 M, 33.0 mmol, (Note 8)) is added dropwise after 15 min. Then the \u221278\u00b0C bath is exchanged for an ice bath. After 5 min, the reaction mixture is recooled to \u221278\u00b0C and a cooled (\u221220\u00b0C) solution of benzyl 2,3-epoxypropyl ether (4.93 g, 30.0 mmol, (Note 9)) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) is added to the cuprate solution via cannula over a 10-min period. The reaction mixture is warmed to 0\u00b0C (Note 10). After 3 hr at 0\u00b0C, it is warmed to ambient temperature and stirred for an additional 1 hr. It is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and poured on to a solution of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (135 mL) and concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide (15 mL). The mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min while the temperature of the system is allowed to rise. The mixture is filtered through Celite. The flask and the filter cake are rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The tetrahydrofuran is evaporated using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 150 mL). Each organic layer is washed with water (75 mL) and brine (75 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 11), using a 6 : 1 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluant (Note 12), to afford an oil (5.7 g, 29.6 mmol, 99%), which is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to give 4.20 g of an oil (26.1 mmol, 73%) (Note 13) as a colorless liquid, bp 85\u00b0C at 0.1 mm; IR (neat) cm\u22121: 3400, 3070, 3030, 1640, 1100, 740, 700; 1H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4: 2.26 (t, 2 H, J = 6.9), 2.41 (d, 1 H, J = 3.3), 3.4\u20133.6 (m, 2 H), 3.90 (m, 1 H), 4.55 (s, 2 H), 5.1 (m, 2 H), 5.75\u20135.90 (m, 1 H), 7.33 (s, 5 H); mass spectrum, m/e (relative intensity): 192 (M+, 1.06), 92 (24.89), 91 (100); high-resolution mass spectrum.

            "A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask with mechanical stirrer and vacuum outlet (Note 1) is charged with powdered cerium (III) chloride (CeCl3 \u00b7 7H2O, 52.92 g, 0.142 mol) (Note 2). The flask is immersed to the necks in an oil bath and evacuated to 0.2 mm. The solid is agitated by stirring as the flask is heated to 150\u00b0C for 2 hr. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, it is vented to the atmosphere and quickly purged with a stream of dry nitrogen for 2 min. At this stage, the flask is fitted with a low-temperature thermometer and a graduated 250-mL addition funnel containing 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 3), and capped with a rubber septum. Connection to a dry nitrogen line with a pressure relief bubbler is made via a needle through the septum. Tetrahydrofuran is run into the flask with good stirring, so that an even suspension results (Note 4). The white suspension is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. Meanwhile, the addition funnel is charged with trimethylsilylmethylmagnesium chloride (Me3SiCH2MgCl, 1 M solution in ethyl ether, 142 mL, 0.142 mol) (Note 5) and (Note 6), transferred via stainless-steel cannula. The contents of the flask are cooled to \u221265\u00b0C with a dry ice/2-propanol bath, and the Grignard solution is added dropwise over a period of 40\u201350 min, so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below \u221260\u00b0C. The addition funnel is removed from the setup, with the septum/nitrogen inlet connected directly to the flask. After the cold mixture is stirred for 15 min more, ethyl cinnamate (10.32 g, 0.0586 mol) (Note 7) is added via syringe over a 2\u20133-min period. Stirring is continued as the flask is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature (Note 8). The off-white to beige reaction mixture is cooled to <5\u00b0C (ice-water bath) and quenched by the portionwise addition of chilled 1 M hydrochloric acid (200 mL), so that the internal temperature remains below 20\u00b0C (Note 9). The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with ethyl ether (100 mL each). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 10) and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvents are removed at a rotary evaporator (25\u00b0C at 60 mm). The residual oil is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and distilled bulb-to-bulb (Note 11). The product (9.69\u20139.85 g, 76.5\u201378%) (Note 12) is collected at an air-bath temperature of 110\u2013112\u00b0C, 0.20 mm."

            "A. 1-[(Isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl]cyclohexanol. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a magnetic stirrer, a three-way stopcock, and a reflux condenser connected with a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is charged with magnesium turnings (2.43 g, 100 mg-atm) that are dried under a rapid stream of nitrogen with a heat gun. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the rate of nitrogen flow is reduced. Several milliliters of a solution of (isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl chloride (16.67 g, 100 mmol) (Note 1) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (120 mL) (Note 2) and about 50 \u03bcL of 1,2-dibromoethane are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature and within a few minutes an exothermic reaction starts. The remaining solution is added dropwise at room temperature over ca. 45 min at such a rate as to maintain a gently exothermic reaction. After the addition is complete, the tan-gray mixture is refluxed for 0.5 hr and then cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice bath. A solution of freshly distilled cyclohexanone (7.36 g, 75 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL) is added dropwise with stirring over 30 min. The resultant mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for another 30 min (Note 3) and then hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of an aqueous 10% solution of ammonium chloride (100 mL) at 0\u00b0C over 10 min. The organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 40-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layer and extracts are washed once with aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator below room temperature (Note 4) at water aspirator pressure. A colorless oil remains (Note 5).\nB. 1-(Hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanol The 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing the crude 1-[(isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl]cyclohexanol is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer, and is kept open to air throughout the reaction. The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (75 mL), methanol (75 mL) (Note 6), potassium hydrogen carbonate (7.5 g 75 mmol), and potassium fluoride (8.7 g, 150 mmol) (Note 7). To the stirred mixture is added 30% hydrogen peroxide (28.0 mL, 247.5 mmol) in one portion at room temperature. A somewhat cloudy organic layer and a milky-white, heavy inorganic layer result. After several minutes an exothermic reaction begins which is controlled by intermittent, brief cooling with a water bath to maintain the temperature at 40\u201350\u00b0C (Note 8). After about 30 min the exothermic reaction ceases. The mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 2 hr (Note 9). The remaining hydrogen peroxide is decomposed by careful dropwise addition (Note 10) of an aqueous 50% solution of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (ca. 30 mL) with stirring over 30 min, during which time the temperature is maintained near 30\u00b0C by intermittent cooling with an ice bath (Note 11). A negative starch-iodide test is observed (Note 12). A white precipitate forms and diethyl ether (ca. 100 mL) is added to ensure further precipitation. The mixture is filtered with suction and the filter cake is washed with three 20-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and washes are concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 50\u00b0C at water aspirator pressure until much of the water has been removed. The remaining oil is diluted with diethyl ether (ca. 200 mL), transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution to remove the remaining water. The organic layer is separated, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give a colorless solid. The solid is dissolved in a 10 : 1 mixture of hexane\u2013ethyl acetate (75 mL) at reflux, and the hot solution is filtered. The filtrate is allowed to cool to room temperature and finally is kept at 0\u00b0C for 2 hr. The crystals are separated with suction, washed with cold hexane/ethyl acetate (10 : 1, 10 mL), and dried under high vacuum at room temperature. There is obtained 7.54 g (77%) of 1-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanol as white crystals, mp 76.0\u201376.2\u00b0C (Note 13) and (Note 14)."

The flask was charged with 400 mL each of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether, 100 mL of pentane, and pinacolone (7.92 g, 79.1 mmol) (Note 2). The reaction solution was cooled to \u2212110\u00b0C (Note 3) and (Note 4) under an argon atmosphere and carbon monoxide (Note 5) was bubbled in for 30 min. Then a solution of butyllithium (2.53 N solution in pentane, 31.0 mL, 78.43 mmol) (Note 6) was added at 0.6\u20131.0 mL/min by means of a syringe pump (Note 7).

            "A. (E)-6,10-Dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-1-yne. An oven-dried (Note 1), 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar (Note 2), a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped by a rubber septum (Note 3), a dry-ice condenser capped by a rubber septum, and a rubber septum (capping the central neck) bearing a stainless-steel cannula that serves as an argon inlet. The flask is charged with 190 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether (Note 4) and cooled to ca. \u221278\u00b0C using a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. On a separate assembly (Note 5), allene gas (d at \u221240\u00b0C = 0.67 g/mL) from a compressed-gas cylinder (Note 6) is condensed into a dry, 100-mL Pyrex graduated cylinder equipped with a 24/40 standard taper joint attached to a Claisen adapter and dry-ice condenser (containing a slurry of dry ice\u2013acetone) and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a bath of dry ice\u2013acetone (Note 7). After 22.5 mL (375 mmol) of liquid allene has been collected, the adapter and the condenser are removed and the graduated cylinder is capped with a rubber septum through which is inserted a cannula. The other end of this cannula is inserted through the rubber septum on the central neck to reach just below the surface of the cooled solvent. The allene is then transferred to the reaction vessel by removing the cylinder from the cooling bath. The temperature of the reaction vessel is maintained at \u221278\u00b0C, and a solution of 190 mL of 1.37 M butyllithium (260 mmol) in hexane (Note 8) is added dropwise over 1 hr through the addition funnel, which is then rinsed with 5 mL of dry ether. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually (over ca. 30 min) to \u221215\u00b0C and the white precipitate that forms is stirred an additional 15 min under an argon atmosphere. A solution of 12.9 g (75 mmol) of geranyl chloride (Note 9) in 40 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over 303 min through the addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at \u221215\u00b0C. Then the stirred mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 1 hr (Note 10). The resulting white suspension containing the lithium acetylide 2 is carefully poured into 450 mL of ice-water slurry, the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride, and the product is extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure using a 25-cm Vigreux column. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to afford 10.5\u201311.2 g (79\u201389% yield) of (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-1-yne, bp 103\u2013107\u00b0C (10 mm) (Note 11).\nB. (E)-7,11-Dimethyl-6,10-dodecadien-2-yn-1-ol. To the suspension containing the acetylide intermediate 2, as prepared in Part A, is added 14 g (460 mmol) of paraformaldehyde (Note 12) in portions (Note 13) over 10 min (Note 14). After stirring the mixture for 24 hr, the resulting suspension is poured into 450 mL of ice-cold water (Note 15), the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride, and the product is extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed at room temperature on a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to provide a forerun of 2-butyn-1-ol (bp 42\u201346\u00b0C, 6 mm), followed by 10.5 g (68% yield) of (E)-7,11-dimethyl-6,10-dodecadien-2-yn-1-ol as a colorless liquid, bp 120\u2013124\u00b0C (0.5 mm) (Note 16)."

            "Caution! Molecular fluorine is a very toxic and corrosive gas. The following reaction should be carried out in an efficient fume hood, and the experimenter should be familiar with the precautions necessary for safe handling of fluorine.3 Since molecular fluorine diluted with an inert gas is much safer to handle than pure fluorine, the use of a fluorinel nitrogen mixture comprising no more than 20% fluorine is recommended.\nA. N-Fluoropyridinium triflate (1). The reaction is carried out in the apparatus shown in Figure 1. The pressure regulator on the cylinder containing a mixture of 20% fluorine/80% nitrogen (Note 1), and the pressure gauge and flowmeter on the fluorine line are specifically designed for fluorine service (Note 2). The fluorine and nitrogen cylinders, pressure regulators, flowmeters, valves, and filters are connected with stainless-steel tubing. The Pyrex glass reaction vessel is connected to the metal tubing via Viton\u00ae tubing, and the fluorine gas is introduced into the vessel through a Pyrex glass tube (7 mm o. d.). The gas outlet from the reaction vessel is connected to a granular alumina trap which consumes molecular fluorine.\nFigure 1.

The system is purged with nitrogen, and the reaction mixture is chilled and maintained at \u221240\u00b0C. The flow of dilute fluorine is started, and the flow rates from the nitrogen and fluorine cylinders are adjusted to introduce a 10% fluorine/90% nitrogen mixture at a rate of 90 mL/min just above the surface of the rapidly stirred solution (Note 6). When a total of 2.7 L of fluorine (0.12 mol) is introduced (Note 7), the flow of fluorine is discontinued and nitrogen only is flowed through the system at a rate of 45 mL/min for 30 min while keeping the reaction mixture at \u221240\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the sodium fluoride. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness with a rotary evaporator without heating. The crystalline residue is washed with 30 mL of dry ethyl acetate to give 11.0\u201312.0 g (74\u201381%) of crude product, mp 178\u2013181\u00b0C. The crude material is dissolved in 18 mL of dry acetonitrile at room temperature, and 36 mL of dry diethyl ether is added. The precipitated crystals are collected by filtration under nitrogen (Note 8) to give 10.0\u201310.3 g (68\u201370%) of pure N-fluoropyridinium triflate, mp 182\u00b0C (Note 9),(Note 10),(Note 11).\nB. 3-Methoxy-17-trimethylsiloxy-1,3,5(10), 16-estratetraene. A 125-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer is purged with argon and charged with 6.8 g (0.024 mol) of estrone 3-methyl ether (Note 12), 50 mL of dry benzene, and 4.0 mL (2.9 g, 0.029 mol) of triethylamine. The solution is stirred, 4.9 mL (5.6 g, 0.025 mol) of trimethylsilyl triflate (Note 13) is added through a syringe, and the mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon it separates into two layers. Dry hexane (40 mL) is added, and the upper hexane\u2013benzene layer is separated, washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate and water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is transferred to a 125-mL, round-bottomed, tared flask. The solution is evaporated to a constant weight with a rotary evaporator, initially at water-aspirator pressure and then at 0.5\u20131 mm, to leave 8.6 g (100%) of pale-yellow enol trimethylsilyl ether. This material is used immediately in Part C without purification (Note 14).\nC. 16\u03b1-Fluoro-3-methoxy-1,3,5(10)-estratrien-17-one (16\u03b1-fluoroestrone 3-methyl ether). The 125-mL, round-bottomed flask containing the enol silyl ether from Part B is purged with argon, and 50 mL of dry dichloromethane is added. N-Fluoropyridinium triflate (1) (6.5 g, 0.026 mol) is added in one portion, and the mixture is stirred at 20\u201325\u00b0C for 8 hr (Note 15). The reaction mixture is poured into water and extracted with three 60-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and then with water, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the solution is evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator. The resulting pale-yellow solid is column-chromatographed on silica gel (250 g, 60 \u00d7 4.5-cm column) using dichloromethane eluant (Note 16) to give 950 mg (14%) of estrone 3-methyl ether starting material and 4.8 g (66%) of 16\u03b1-fluoroestrone 3-methyl ether as a colorless solid, mp 157\u00b0C (Note 17),(Note 18),(Note 19)."

The suspension of camphorsulfonic acid was heated to reflux and 71.4 g (43.77 mL, 0.6 mol, 1.2 equiv) of freshly distilled thionyl chloride was added dropwise over a 1-hr period. Heating was continued until gas evolution (sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride) had ceased (approximately 9\u201310 hr). The resultant solution of camphorsulfonyl chloride in chloroform was converted to camphorsulfonamide without further purification.\nIn a 5-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 250-mL dropping funnel and a mechanical stirrer was placed a solution of 1.6 L of reagent-grade ammonium hydroxide solution and the flask was cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. The solution of the crude camphorsulfonyl chloride, prepared in the preceding section, was added dropwise to the ammonium hydroxide solution at 0\u201310\u00b0C over a period of 1 hr. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, stirred for 4 hr, the organic layer separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (3 \u00d7 250 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (250 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent on the rotary evaporator gave 104.0 g (90%) of the crude camphorsulfonamide (Note 2) and (Note 3).\nB. (\u2212)-(Camphorsulfonyl)imine. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2-in. egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a Dean\u2013Stark water separator, and a double-walled condenser containing a mineral oil bubbler connected to an inert gas source. Into the flask are placed 5 g of Amberlyst 15 ion-exchange resin (Note 4) and 41.5 g of the crude (+)-(1S)-camphorsulfonamide in 500 mL of toluene. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 hr. After the reaction flask is cooled, but while it is still warm (40\u201350\u00b0C), 200 mL of methylene chloride is slowly added to dissolve any (camphorsulfonyl)imine that crystallizes. The solution is filtered through a 150-mL sintered glass funnel of coarse porosity an the reaction flask and filter funnel are washed with an additional 75 mL of methylene chloride.\nIsolation of the (\u2212)-(camphorsulfonyl)imine is accomplished by removal of the toluene on the rotary evaporator.

A 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed Morton flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a 125-mm Teflon stirring blade, a Safe Lab stirring bearing (Note 6), and a 500-mL addition funnel. Into the flask are placed the toluene solution of (\u2212)-(camphorsulfonyl)imine (39.9 g, 0.187 mol) prepared in Step B and a room-temperature solution of 543 g (3.93 mol, 7 equiv based on oxone) of anhydrous potassium carbonate dissolved in 750 mL of water. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and a solution of 345 g (0.56 mol, 6 equiv of KHSO5) of oxone dissolved in 1250 mL of water is added dropwise in three portions over 45 min (Note 7) and (Note 8). Completion of the oxidation is determined by TLC (Note 9) and the reaction mixture is filtered through a 150-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity to remove solids. The filtrate is transferred to a 3-L separatory funnel, the toluene phase is separated and the aqueous phase is washed with methylene chloride (3 \u00d7 100 mL). The filtered solids and any solids remaining in the Morton flask are washed with an additional 200 mL of methylene chloride.

A 2-L, three-necked Morton flask fitted with a low-temperature thermometer, a 250-mL addition funnel, an exit tube attached to a calcium chloride drying tube, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 1.1 L of anhydrous ethanol. The stirred solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and 23 g (1 mol) of sodium cut into small pieces is added through the exit tube. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture increases; therefore, cooling is applied (Note 1). After all of the sodium has completely reacted, 160.2 g (1 mol) of neat diethyl malonate is slowly added through the addition funnel while the temperature is maintained at 0\u00b0C (Note 2). At this point, 110.2 g (1 mol) of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one (Note 3) is gradually introduced through the addition funnel at 0\u00b0C. A white precipitate eventually appears. After 9 days of stirring, the brown reaction mixture is poured onto ice, brought to neutrality with concentrated hydrochloric acid while being vigorously stirred, and extracted with one 600-mL portion and four 300-mL portions of ether (Note 4). The combined organic layers are washed with three 250-mL portions of saturated brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After evaporation under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, the residual oil is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure. The first fraction (bp <60\u00b0C at 0.15 mm) consists of a mixture of unreacted starting materials. The second fraction (bp 145\u2013165\u00b0C at 1.5 mm), a mixture of diesters (Note 5), is a colorless oil: 202\u2013205 g (74\u201376%).\nIn a 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 99 g (0.366 mol) of the diesters. A 1.0-M solution of potassium hydroxide (750 mL, 0.75 mol) is added to the flask with stirring. The mixture is stirred overnight and subsequently heated to reflux for 1 hr. After the mixture is cooled, it is acidified with 100 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and gently boiled for 20 min. Following return to room temperature, the mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with dichloromethane (6 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated brine (100 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed in a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus (140\u2013160\u00b0C and 0.3\u20130.5 mm) to provide 49.3 g (79%) of the keto acid (Note 6).\nB. 4-Methylbicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2,6-dione. A 2-L, three-necked, Morton flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser is charged with 245.0 g of polyphosphoric acid (PPA, (Note 7)), 26.8 g (158 mmol) of the keto acid, and 427 mL of glacial acetic acid. The vigorously stirred mixture is heated at 100\u00b0C for 7 hr. After being cooled, the reaction mixture is diluted with 500 mL of saturated brine and extracted with four 200-mL portions of benzene (Note 8). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (4 \u00d7 100 mL) and brine (1 \u00d7 100 mL) solutions, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the solvents on a rotary evaporator, the viscous residue is distilled under reduced pressure in a Kugelrohr apparatus, affording 11.0\u201313.3 g (46\u201355%) of cyclized diketone as a colorless liquid, bp 100\u00b0C at 0.1 mm, which may solidify on standing at room temperature (Note 9).\nC. 4-Methyltricyclo[2.2.2.03,5]octane-3,5-dione.

The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C (acetone\u2013dry ice bath), and 137.5 mL (220 mmol) of a 1.6 M solution of butyllithium in hexanes is introduced over a 35-min period. The resulting colorless solution is stirred for 15 min at 0\u00b0C and then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C.\nThe diketone (15.20 g, 100 mmol) is dissolved in 27 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran in a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask and added dropwise through a 16-gauge cannula (nitrogen pressure) during 35 min to the lithium diisopropylamide solution. This mixture is stirred for 30 min at \u221278\u00b0C and is added in turn to 280.4 mL (300 mmol) of a 1.07 M solution of anhydrous ferric chloride (Note 10) in dry dimethylformamide, diluted with 39 mL of dry dimethylformamide and contained in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (Note 11). This addition is accomplished as rapidly as possible through an 8-gauge cannula (nitrogen pressure). After the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, it is quenched by the dropwise addition of 24 mL of dry methanol and allowed to reach room temperature. Saturated brine (300 mL) is added and the entire mixture is filtered through Celite. The aqueous phase is extracted with four 250-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with saturated brine (3 \u00d7 150 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After solvent evaporation under reduced pressure, the residue is chromatographed (100 g of TLC-grade silica gel; eluant is 15% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether). There is isolated 6.4\u20136.5 g (43%, (Note 12)) of the cyclized diketone as a colorless oil (Note 13) and 1.11 g (7.3%) of starting material."

            "Caution! Diazomethane is toxic and explosive; all operations should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood with adequate shielding. (See (Note 1).)\nA. 1-Diazo-4-phenyl-2-butanone. A 1-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a two-in. magnetic stirring bar and a two-hole rubber stopper fitted with a 125-mL Teflon stopcock separatory funnel (Note 2) and a drying tube filled with potassium hydroxide (Note 3) is charged with a solution of 200 mmol (3.4 equiv) of diazomethane (Note 4) in 600 mL of dry ether. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C and stirred at high speed (Note 5). To this cooled solution, 10.0 g (59 mmol) of hydrocinnamoyl chloride (3-phenylpropionyl chloride) (Note 6) diluted to 125 mL with anhydrous ether is added dropwise over a 1-hr period. The resulting reaction mixture is stirred cold for an additional 0.5 hr and then at room temperature for 1 hr. After this period of time the reaction is complete, and excess diazomethane is removed by evacuating the Erlenmeyer flask with a water aspirator pump in the hood (Note 7). The Erlenmeyer flask is evacuated by connecting the aspirator to a one-hole stopper that has been fitted with a plastic or fire-polished glass tube. After the diazomethane has been removed, the remaining ethereal solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation to give 10.5\u201310.6 g (> 100% crude yield) of 1-diazo-4-phenyl-2-butanone as a yellow oil (Note 8). This oil is used without purification for the next reaction.\nB. 3,4-Dihydro-1(2H)-azulenone. A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a high dilution trident (Fig. 1)2 (Note 9). The high-dilution trident is further equipped with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel attached to a nitrogen inlet and an efficient reflux condenser attached to a nitrogen outlet. The round-bottomed flask is charged with 100 mL of dry freshly distilled methylene chloride and 12 mg of rhodium diacetate dimer (Note 10). This heterogeneous mixture is stirred at high speed (Note 11) and heated to a rapid reflux without bumping. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of 8.7 g (50 mmol) of 1-diazo-4-phenyl-2-butanone (Note 12) diluted to 50 mL with methylene chloride. As soon as the high-dilution trident reservoir (20 mL) fills up and begins to overflow back into the round-bottomed flask, dropwise addition of the diazo ketone solution is initiated (1:20, one drop of diazo ketone solution to every 20 drops of solvent entering the trident reservoir from the condenser). After the addition is complete (2.5\u20133 hr), the reaction mixture is allowed to reflux for an additional 1 hr. The reaction mixture is then cooled, and the yellow-green solution of the initially formed unstable trienone (Note 13) is suction-filtered through 110 g of neutral alumina (Note 14) in a 250-mL fritted-glass funnel to isomerize the \u03b2,\u03b3 double bond into conjugation with the carbonyl group and to remove the rhodium diacetate dimer. The alumina is then washed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic filtrates are concentrated by rotary evaporation to give a yellow oil. Vacuum distillation of this oil through a short-path distillation head gives 5.5\u20135.7 g (75\u201378% yield) of a colorless to slightly green oil that solidifies at 0\u00b0C, bp 73\u201375\u00b0C/0.2 mm (Note 15). This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 16). Recrystallization from hexane (80 mL per gram of trienone) yields colorless needles, mp 28.5\u201329.0\u00b0C (Note 17).\nFigure 1"

Next 34.8 mL (55.0 mmol) of butyllithium (1.58 M, (Note 4), in hexane) is added dropwise (over 4 min) to the vigorously stirred diisopropylamine solution, and stirred at \u221210\u00b0C for 20 min. Tributyltin hydride (15.2 mL, 55.0 mmol, (Note 5)) is added dropwise over 5 min to the solution, and the reaction mixture is stirred under argon at \u221210\u00b0 to 0\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. The flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and stirred for 20 min.\nA flame-dried (Note 1), 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and an argon inlet is charged with 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2) and 4.85 mL (50.1 mmol) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (Note 6), and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. This solution (54.85 mL) is cannulated into the tributyltinlithium solution dropwise over 8 min (Note 7), and the solution is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C under argon for 25 min (Note 8). The same 100-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2) and 6.1 mL (59.4 mmol) of ethyl vinyl ketone (Note 9), and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C. This solution (56.1 mL) is cannulated into the 500-mL, round-bottomed flask dropwise over 8 min (Note 10), and the solution is stirred for 1.5 hr (Note 11). The resulting solution is then transferred from a \u221278\u00b0C cold bath to a \u221223\u00b0C cold bath (Note 12) and stirred at this temperature for 30 min.\nA flame-dried (Note 1), 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a Teflon stopcock, rubber septa, and an argon inlet is charged with 6 g of paraformaldehyde (Note 13). The flask is heated to 165\u2013170\u00b0C and the gaseous formaldehyde is bubbled into the \u221223\u00b0C solution (Note 14). After 15 min all of the paraformaldehyde is pyrolyzed (Note 15), and the solution becomes slightly cloudy and yellow. The 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is transferred to a \u221240\u00b0C bath (maintained by a Flexicool cryostat) and allowed to stir under argon for 20 hr. The reaction mixture is quenched at \u221240\u00b0C with 7 mL of saturated ammonium chloride followed by 8 mL of distilled water. It is warmed to room temperature, poured into a 500-mL separatory funnel, and diluted with 75 mL of water; the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated (Note 16) to afford 29.3 g of crude product.\nA flame-dried (Note 1), 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, rubber septa, a 24/40 condenser, and an argon inlet is charged with 300 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 17) and 29.00 g (65.4 mmol) of lead tetraacetate (Note 18). The suspension is heated to 80\u00b0C and stirred vigorously under argon. A flame-dried (Note 1), 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, rubber septa, and an argon inlet is charged with 150 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 17) and 29.3 g of the crude reaction mixture. This solution is cannulated into the lead tetraacetate suspension over 2 min (Note 19), and the suspension is allowed to reflux for 2.5 hr. The reaction flask is cooled to room temperature, quenched with 200 mL of distilled water, poured into a 2-L separatory funnel, and diluted with 1000 mL of diethyl ether (Note 29). The organic layer is washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3 \u00d7 200 mL), aqueous 5% hydrochloric acid (2 \u00d7 200 mL), distilled water (200 mL), and brine (200 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered; solvent removal afforded 28.95 g of a crude oil. This crude residue (light-yellow-brown oil) is purified by short-path column chromatography (Note 21) to yield 4.37 g (41.5%) of 8-propionyl-(E)-5-nonenolide (Note 22) and (Note 23)."

            "A 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar, a gas inlet, and a reflux condenser. The top of the condenser is connected to a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel isolated from moisture by a sulfuric acid trap (Note 1). The flask is cooled to \u221215\u00b0C and charged with N,N-dimethylacetamide (3.26 g, 37.5 mmol) (Note 2) in 100 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane (Note 3). The dropping funnel is charged with 1-octene (16.8 g, 150 mmol) (Note 4) and 2,4,6-collidine (5.44 g, 45 mmol) (Note 5) in 50 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane. A slightly positive pressure of argon is maintained in the apparatus throughout the course of the reaction. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (12.69 g, 45 mmol) (Note 6) is added through the rubber septum into the solution of N,N-dimethylacetamide by means of a syringe. A precipitate is formed. The olefin\u2013collidine solution is then added dropwise over a 20-min period. During these operations rapid stirring and cooling are maintained. The resulting mixture is refluxed for 17 hr (Note 7). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The oily residue is washed with dry ether (3 \u00d7 20 mL) (Note 8). Then 20 mL of carbon tetrachloride (Note 9) and 20 mL of water are added to the crude cyclobutaniminium salt. The mixture is refluxed for 6 hr (Note 10). The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with carbon tetrachloride (3 \u00d7 20 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure (Note 11). Bulb-to-bulb distillation (bath temperature 100\u2013110\u00b0C, water pump) gives 3.3 g (59%) of 3-hexylcyclobutanone (Note 12) and (Note 13)."

The mixture is heated to reflux with stirring overnight (~18 hr) with separation of water. The solution is cooled, washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and brine, and dried with magnesium sulfate. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue is distilled to give 60.88 g (96%) of the furanone as a clear colorless liquid (bp 90\u201391\u00b0C, 1.5-mm; lit.2 mp 23\u201324\u00b0C, bp 109\u2013111\u00b0C, 6 mm).\nB. 7-Chloro-7-cyanobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. To a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask is added 20.0 g (94.8 mmol) of 3,4-dichloro-5-isopropoxy-2(5H)-furanone and 120 mL of methanol. The flask is cooled in an ice bath with stirring and 7.5 g (115.4 mmol) of sodium azide is added. The ice bath is removed after 15 min and the mixture is stirred for an additional 50 min.

The solution is stirred and cooled in an ethylene glycol\u2013dry ice bath (\u221215\u00b0C) and 24.17 mL (55.6 mmol) of 2.3 M butyllithium is added slowly by means of a syringe pump (rate = 1.5 mL/min). After complete addition, the solution is stirred for an additional 30 min. The ethylene glycol\u2013dry ice bath is replaced with an ice bath and the solution stirred for 1.5 hr at 0\u00b0C. The flask is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath.\nA 1000-mL, round-bottomed flask is flame-dried and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum and charged with 9.00 g (52.9 mmol) of diethyl squarate (Note 3) and 450 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The solution is stirred and cooled in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath at \u221278\u00b0C. The solution of 2-lithiofuran is transferred dropwise via cannula to the flask containing the diethyl squarate, which is stirred rapidly. After complete addition (45 min), the solution is stirred for 20 min and quenched by pouring the cold solution into a separatory funnel containing 150 mL of aqueous 10% ammonium chloride and 100 mL of diethyl ether. The separatory funnel is shaken vigorously until phase separation is achieved and all of the ice has melted. The aqueous phase is separated from the organic phase and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 40-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layer is washed with 125 mL of brine solution and dried over solid anhydrous potassium carbonate (Note 4) for 5 min with gentle swirling.\nThe solution is decanted from the potassium carbonate (Note 5) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (bath temperature = 23\u201340\u00b0C) to approximately 150 mL in a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask. Then 400 mL of dry p-xylene (Note 6) is added and the flask is placed on the rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 40\u00b0C to remove the remaining tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether. The flask containing the remaining p-xylene solution of the cyclobutenone is fitted with a reflux condenser and heated at reflux for 3 hr under nitrogen.

            "A. N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine \u03b2-lactone.2 3 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet adaptor, a low temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum (Note 1). The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (1.1 L) and triphenylphosphine (42.1 g, 160 mmol, (Note 2)). The triphenylphosphine is dissolved with stirring and the flask is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 3). Distilled dimethyl azodicarboxylate (17.7 mL, 160 mmol, d = 1.33 g/mL at 25\u00b0C) is added dropwise with a syringe over 10 min (Caution, (Note 4)). The resulting pale yellow solution is stirred at \u221275\u00b0 to \u221278\u00b0C for 10 min, at which point a milky white slurry is obtained. The rubber septum on the flask is quickly replaced with a 1-L, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine (38.3 g, 160 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (240 mL), (Note 2), (Note 5) which is added dropwise to the mixture over 30 min. After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at \u221275\u00b0 to \u221277\u00b0C for 20 min, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is slowly warmed with stirring to room temperature over 2.5 hr (Note 6). The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 35\u00b0C. The residual pale yellow syrup is dried briefly (15 min) under high vacuum (~0.2 mm) and suspended in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 20 mL). Ethyl acetate (30 mL) is added to give a solution which is applied to a 10 \u00d7 23-cm column of flash silica gel4 (800 g) packed in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1). The flask and the sides of the column are rinsed with additional ethyl acetate (20 mL), and this is added to the column which is then eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 2.6 L). The solvent is changed to hexane/ethyl acetate (3/2) and 500-mL fractions are collected. Concentration of fractions 6\u201310 on a rotary evaporator gives 15.5 g (44%) of analytically pure N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine \u03b2-lactone (Note 7). Fractions 11\u201314 contain slightly impure \u03b2-lactone. The solid obtained from concentration of these fractions on a rotary evaporator is dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and precipitated by addition of hexane (50 mL) followed by cooling to \u221220\u00b0C (0.5 hr). The process is repeated twice to afford additional \u03b2-lactone (1.25 g). The total yield is 16.8 g (47%) (Note 8).",
            "B. N\u03b1-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-\u03b2-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine.2,3,5 6 7 A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum and an argon inlet (Note 1). The flask is charged with N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine \u03b2-lactone (15 g, 68 mmol) and anhydrous acetonitrile (240 mL, (Note 2)). The cloudy mixture is stirred and solid pyrazole (4.9 g, 72 mmol) (Note 9) is added. The rubber septum is quickly replaced with a reflux condenser and an argon inlet adaptor, and the reaction mixture is heated in an oil bath at 52\u201354\u00b0C for 24 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to leave a white solid that is dried under vacuum for 30 min. Sodium hydroxide (1 N, 69 mL) is added, the suspension is diluted with distilled water (350 mL) and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min. It is then extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 100 mL) to remove unreacted pyrazole and side products. The aqueous phase is cooled in an ice bath to ca. 4\u00b0C, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added with stirring to bring the pH to 1 (about 10 mL required). The resulting precipitate is filtered, washed with water (ca. 75 mL), air dried, and then completely dried in a desiccator over phosphorus oxide (P2O5) at 0.2 mm for 12 hr. This material is recrystallized from ethyl acetate (350 mL) to give 7.3 g of pure product (37% yield). Concentration of the mother liquor on a rotary evaporator and recrystallization from the minimum volume of ethyl acetate gives an additional 1.1 g of analytically pure N\u03b1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-\u03b2-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine. The total yield is 8.4 g (43%) (Note 10)."

The solution of imines 1 is cooled in an ice bath and 72.5 mL (61.0 g, 0.870 mol, ca. 1.05 equiv) of freshly distilled methyl vinyl ketone (Note 3) is added with a syringe, with magnetic stirring, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is then heated at ca. 40\u00b0C for 24 hr.\nThe slightly yellow solution is cooled in an ice bath and 60 mL of glacial acetic acid (ca. 1 mol) and 50 mL of water are added. Hydrolysis is achieved by stirring the heterogeneous mixture at room temperature for 2 hr. The now clear solution is poured into a 2000-mL separatory funnel containing 100 mL of brine and 160 mL of water and is extracted five times with a 50:50 mixture of ether-petroleum ether (35\u201360\u00b0C) (1000-mL total amount). The organic phase is washed efficiently with 20 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid, 20 mL of water, and two 10-mL portions of brine.\nThe aqueous layer is kept for recovery of the amine (see D below).\nThe pale yellow organic layer is dried over a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered.

The solution is stirred at room temperature for 15 min under a slight stream of nitrogen to remove traces of oxygen. A 25 wt. % solution of sodium methoxide in methanol (Note 4) is then introduced dropwise with a syringe, under stirring, until a slightly red color develops (Note 5). At this point, 15 mL (ca. 0.07 mol) of the sodium methoxide solution is added and the mixture is heated at 60\u00b0C for 10 hr under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution is cooled and the now deep red solution is neutralized with glacial acetic acid (ca. 4.5 mL) until the color turns yellow. Methanol is removed with a rotary evaporator until a thick paste (sodium acetate) results; this is dissolved with 200 mL of water. Extraction is effected in a 2000-mL separatory funnel using four portions of a 50:50 mixture (1000 mL total amount) of ether-petroleum ether (35\u201360\u00b0C). The pale orange organic phase is washed twice with 40 mL of water, then twice with 20 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered.

The oil is purified by recrystallization at a low temperature with an apparatus designed for this purpose.2 The oil is dissolved with stirring in a 1000-mL, round-bottomed flask with 370 mL of pentane under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is then cautiously cooled in a Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen until the solution is solid. The Dewar flask is removed and the temperature is allowed to rise, while magnetic stirring is resumed. When a crystalline mass in suspension appears suddenly (Note 7), an acetone bath adjusted to about \u221210\u00b0C is installed. When only a few crystals remain in suspension, the bath temperature is slowly lowered to \u221235\u00b0C, inducing crystallization. After the mixture has been kept at \u221235\u00b0C for 15 min, magnetic stirring is stopped and efficient filtration is performed through the filter stick. Still at \u221235\u00b0C, the compound is washed with 40 mL of pentane. The solution is stirred vigorously for 5 min and filtered as before. The washing operation is repeated two more times. The flask is warmed to room temperature and the oil is distilled as before, bp 70\u00b0C (2 mm), to afford 60\u201365 g (44\u201348% overall yield from 2-methylcyclohexanone) of methyloctalone 3 [>99% chemical purity, capillary GLC (Note 6)], [\u03b1]D20 \u2212210\u00b0 (ethanol, c 1.00), optical purity 96% (Note 8).",

        "Procedure": [
            "A. 4-Nitro-3-hexanol (1).2 To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and drying tube are added propionaldehyde (174 g, 3 mol) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (450 mL) (Note 1). The solution is stirred while finely ground potassium fluoride (25 g, 0.15 mol) is added to the flask. 1-Nitropropane (267.3 g, 3 mol) (Note 1) is then added dropwise with stirring, and the temperature is kept below 40\u00b0C with the aid of an ice bath (Note 2). The ice bath is removed about 30 min after the addition of 1-nitropropane is complete. The flask contents are stirred for an additional 18 hr. The catalyst is then removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is poured into water (500 mL) and the oil is extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 300 mL). The ethereal layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The remaining liquid is distilled under reduced pressure and the fraction boiling at 88\u201390\u00b0C/2 mm is collected in a tared, 1-L round-bottomed flask, yielding 3-nitro-4-hexanol (330 g, 2.24 mol, 65%) (Note 3). The flask containing the product is used directly in the next step.",
            "B. 4-Acetoxy-3-nitrohexane (2).3 To the above flask, containing 3-nitro-4-hexanol (330 g, 2.24 mol), is added a magnetic stirring egg and 1 mL of concd sulfuric acid. The contents of the flask are stirred in an ice bath and acetic anhydride (240 g, 2.35 mol) is added in portions, keeping the temperature of the reactants below 60\u00b0C. After the addition of the acetic anhydride is complete, the contents of the flask are stirred for 1 hr. The flask is then equipped for vacuum distillation. The lower boiling components (Ac2O and AcOH) are removed at 25 mm by gently heating the stirred contents of the flask (\u2264 100\u00b0C bath temperature). After these reagents have been removed, the system is cooled, attached to a vacuum pump, and carefully heated. The fraction boiling at 105\u2013107\u00b0C/10 mm is collected, affording 4-acetoxy-3-nitrohexane (379 g, 2.0 mol, 90%) (Note 4).",
            "C. Ethyl 3,4-diethylpyrrole-2-carboxylate (3)4 and 3,4-Diethylpyrrole (4). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel, thermometer, and drying tube, and charged with 4-acetoxy-3-nitrohexane (103 g, 0.54 mol), ethyl isocyanoacetate (50.7 g, 0.45 mol, (Note 5)), anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (320 mL), and anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (130 mL) (Note 1). 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 152 g, 1 mol) (Note 6) & (Note 7) is then added, taking care to maintain the temperature at 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C at all times with the aid of an ice bath (Note 8). When addition of DBU is complete, the orange solution is stirred for 4 hr at room temperature. The solvent is completely removed under reduced pressure (50\u00b0C bath temp, 20\u201340 mm) and the residue is poured into a 1-L beaker and diluted with warm water (300 mL). To this biphasic mixture is added diethyl ether (300 mL). The contents of the beaker are poured into a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is drawn off and extracted with an additional two portions of ether (300 mL). The ether layers are combined and washed with aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (2 \u00d7 300 mL) and dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). The ether is removed under reduced pressure in a 1-L round-bottomed flask, leaving approximately 95 g of crude ethyl 3,4-diethylpyrrole-2-carboxylate (3) (Note 7). This material is not isolated, but is decarboxylated directly as follows: To the crude product 3 (95 g) is added sodium hydroxide (30 g, 0.75 mol) and ethylene glycol (300 mL). The contents are held at reflux under nitrogen for 1 hr, cooled, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and diluted with water (500 mL) and hexane (600 mL). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted further with hexane (3 \u00d7 300 mL). The hexane layers are combined, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 100\u00b0C/25 mm is collected, yielding 3,4-diethylpyrrole (21.14\u201322.00 g, 0.17\u20130.177 mol, 38.1\u201340%) (Note 9).",
            "D. 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-Octaethylporphyrin (5). A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is wrapped with aluminum foil and equipped with a reflux condenser with a Dean-Stark trap, mechanical stirrer, and nitrogen inlet. The flask is charged with 3,4-diethylpyrrole (1 g, 8.1 mmol), benzene (300 mL) (Note 10), a 37% solution of aqueous formaldehyde (0.73 mL, 8.9 mmol), and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.03 g, 1.7 mmol). The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux under nitrogen using an oil bath, and the water is removed by means of the Dean-Stark trap. After 8 hr, the solution is cooled, and the Dean-Stark trap and condenser are replaced with a fritted glass aerator/bubbler. Oxygen is bubbled through the brown mixture while it is stirred for 12\u201324 hr. Benzene is removed from the flask by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue is dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) (Note 11). The solution is washed with 1 N sodium hydroxide (40 mL) and water (2 \u00d7 20 mL). The chloroform solution is concentrated to 5 mL in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, carefully layered over with methanol (\u224870 mL), and allowed to stand for 48 hr. The resulting solid is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure for 24 hr. The crude material is recrystallized twice from chloroform-hexanes [effected by dissolving in chloroform (\u224810 mL), layering over with hexanes (\u224870 mL), and allowing to stand overnight]. The final precipitate is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure for 48 hr to yield analytically pure 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin (720 mg, 1.34 mmol, 66.4%) as a purple, amorphous powder (Note 12)."

The vessel is charged with 20 g (152 mmol) of 2-cyclopentene-1-acetic acid (Note 2) and 25 mL of dry toluene (Note 3). Oxalyl chloride (17.3 mL, 1.3 equiv) is added slowly over a 30-min period by means of the addition funnel, taking care to release any pressure buildup. (Caution: gaseous hydrogen chloride evolution!.) The dark reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min while the second reaction vessel is assembled, then concentrated to about 2/3 volume at the vacuum pump (Note 4).\nA 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, dry ice condenser, and argon atmosphere is cooled by means of a dry ice/acetone bath and charged with approximately 150 mL of dry liquid ammonia. The 2-(2-cyclopentenyl)acetyl chloride reaction mixture is added carefully but steadily (Note 5) to the cold and rapidly stirred ammonia by syringe. (Caution: vigorous exothermic reaction!). Residual acid chloride is transferred by rinsing the first vessel with 5 mL of toluene. After the addition the mixture is stirred for an additional 5 min, then 60 mL of dichloromethane is added. The cold bath is removed and the excess ammonia is allowed to escape into the fume hood by stirring the open vessel overnight.\nThe crude reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate is reserved. The solids are triturated by stirring vigorously with 100 mL of methanol for 20 min with gentle warming to about 40\u00b0C. The solids are filtered and triturated again in the same way. The three organic filtrates are combined and concentrated to near dryness. The resulting semi-solid is redissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane, filtered to remove residual ammonium chloride, and concentrated to a light brown solid, 18.9 g. The crude product is dissolved in 60 mL of boiling tetrahydrofuran and allowed to crystallize in a \u22126\u00b0C freezer overnight. The amide is collected by filtration, washed with 5 mL of cold ether, and dried under reduced pressure, giving 15.77 g of white flakes, mp 128\u2013129\u00b0C. The filtrate is concentrated to about 8 mL, brought to the cloud point by the addition of a few drops of hexane, and cooled in the freezer.

By means of the addition funnel, 41 mL (210 mmol) of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (Note 9) is slowly added to the cooled and rapidly stirred amide suspension over a 50-min period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at room temperature, then the stirring is stopped, and the two layers are allowed to separate.\nA second, dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, vacuum pump connection, and argon atmosphere. The (top) pentane layer from the first flask, which contains the bis(trimethylsilyl)imidate, is carefully transferred to the second flask by cannula, maintaining the argon atmosphere, and leaving the oily triethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate layer behind. This remaining salt is triturated with 30 mL of a dry 2:1 pentane/ether mixture by stirring for 15 min, allowing the layers to separate, then transferring the extract to the second flask as before. The trituration is repeated with a 30-mL portion of anhydrous ether, and the combined extracts in the second flask are concentrated with stirring to about 1/3 volume using the vacuum pump (Note 10).\nA third, dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an addition funnel, magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, cold water bath, and argon atmosphere is charged with 53.3 g (210 mmol) of molecular iodine and 140 mL of anhydrous ether. The mixture is allowed to stir for 10 min to dissolve most of the iodine. The concentrated organic extract in the second flask is now added to the iodine solution with stirring and cooling over 15 min. The reaction mixture warms slightly during the addition, but should not reach reflux. An additional 10 mL of anhydrous ether is used to complete the transfer of the bis(trimethylsilyl)imidate. Near the end of the addition, the oily black layer (which contains the cyclized iminium salt) solidifies, leaving a clear light brown ether supernatant. The serum stopper is carefully removed and the solid residue gently broken up using a spatula. The stopper is replaced and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for an additional 45 min with occasional swirling by hand. The reaction is quenched by removing the addition funnel and stopper and slowly adding 20 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate. (Caution: vigorous gas evolution!). At this point stirring can be resumed. A 20-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium sulfite is added slowly (more gas evolution), and the process is repeated until 100 mL each of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate and sulfite have been added. The reaction mixture is filtered, the crude solid iodolactam is reserved, and the organic layer is separated and reserved. The aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four, 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The five organic extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated to a light brown solid. This residue is dissolved in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran and hexane is added to the cloud point. Cooling in the freezer gives colorless needles, which are collected and dried under reduced pressure to afford 1.60 g of iodolactam, mp 138\u2013139\u00b0C.\nThe reserved solid from filtration is dried under reduced pressure, dissolved in 65 mL of hot tetrahydrofuran and filtered. The solution is allowed to cool, first at room temperature, then in the freezer. The product (16.77 g, mp 138\u2013139\u00b0C) is collected as before. The mother liquor is concentrated to about 10 mL, brought to the cloud point by the addition of hexane, and cooled in the freezer, resulting in an additional crop of 1.70 g, mp 138\u2013139\u00b0C. The total amount of iodolactam is 19.80 g, representing a 79% yield from the amide (Note 11)."

A dry, 2-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer (Note 1), 1-L pressure-equalizing funnel fitted with a drying tube, low temperature thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet. The flask is charged with 125 mL (1.02 mol) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (Note 2) and 1 L of reagent dichloromethane, cooled to \u221250 to \u221260\u00b0C using an external acetone-dry ice bath, and the solution placed under a slow stream of dry nitrogen. To the vigorously stirred solution is added slowly over a period of 2 hr a solution of 65 mL (1.02 mol) of freshly purified sulfur dichloride (Note 3) in 500 mL of dichloromethane while maintaining the temperature at, or below, \u221250\u00b0C. The cloudy solution is allowed to warm to room temperature and filtered to remove a small amount of white solid. The filtrate is transferred to a 3-L separatory funnel, washed with brine (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and dried (Na2SO4). Solvent is removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to afford 201.4\u2013210.8 g (94\u201398%) of (1\u03b1,2\u03b1,5\u03b1,6\u03b1)-2,6-dichloro-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (1) as a faintly yellow solid, mp 97.5\u201399\u00b0C (Note 4).",
            "B. (endo,endo)-9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diol (2). To a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is added 21.12 g (0.10 mol) of the dichloride (1), 100 mL of acetone, and a solution of 34.33 g (0.12 mol) of sodium carbonate decahydrate (Note 5) in 200 mL of water. A condenser is attached to the flask, the contents are stirred gently and then heated to reflux. After 1 hr at reflux (bath temperature ca. 85\u00b0C) the clear solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and the stirrer bar is removed (Note 6). Solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator until the aqueous slurry of white solid is reduced to roughly 25 mL and then the solid is removed by suction filtration at room temperature. The dried, crude diol is heated with 300 mL of methanol and the hot solution filtered directly into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, thereby removing small quantities of solid impurity (Note 7). A rotary evaporator is used to concentrate the solution to a volume of ca. 40 mL, and the resulting slurry is filtered to yield 15.2\u201316.2 g (87\u201393%) of (endo,endo)-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diol (2) as a white solid (Note 8), (Note 9).",
            "C. 9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione (3).(CAUTION! Oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide are reported to react explosively at room temperature. Preparation C should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood since a co-product of the reaction is dimethyl sulfide). To a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, low temperature thermometer, dropping funnel protected from moisture by a drying tube, and a second drying tube, is added 13.5 mL (0.16 mol) of oxalyl chloride and 350 mL of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred and cooled to \u221278\u00b0C using an external acetone-dry ice bath. A solution of 22.0 mL (0.31 mol) of dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Note 10) in 75 mL of dichloromethane is added over 10 min ensuring that the reaction temperature does not exceed \u221260\u00b0C. After a further 10 min a solution of 13.07 g (0.08 mol) of (endo,endo)-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diol (2) in 30 mL of dry dimethyl sulfoxide is added rapidly from the dropping funnel to the stirred solution at \u221278\u00b0C (Note 11). Final traces of the solution are washed into the reaction using a further 10 mL of dry dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction is stirred for 25 min at \u221278\u00b0C after addition of diol 2 is complete and then 105 mL of redistilled triethylamine is added dropwise. After a further 15 min at \u221278\u00b0C the cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature whereupon 300 mL of water is added. The material is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, the dichloromethane layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts are washed successively with 1 L of 1% hydrochloric acid, 300 mL of 5% aqueous sodium carbonate, and two 300-mL portions of water. After the extracts are dried (anhydrous sodium sulfate), the pale yellow filtrate is evaporated to give 11.9\u201312.4 g of crude 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione (3) as a slightly yellow solid. Thin layer chromatography (silica/dichloromethane) indicates the presence of a small quantity of colored polar impurity, which is not easily removed by recrystallization. The crude solid is dissolved in ca. 300 mL of hot 1:1 ethyl ether/benzene containing 0.5 g of activated charcoal, then filtered through a short plug of Celite filter aid. The plug is washed with further hot solvent and the combined filtrates are evaporated to give 11.3\u201311.7 g (88\u201392%) of 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione (3) as a faintly off-white solid of ca. 99% purity. Analytically pure material is obtained by recrystallization from 2:1 light petroleum/chloroform or from 1:1 light petroleum/dichloromethane. Alternatively, the product is sublimed under reduced pressure (ca. 160\u00b0C/30 mm) (Note 12)."

The flask is charged with 102.6 g (500 mmol) of 6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (Note 2) and 150 mL of alcohol-free chloroform (Note 3). The mixture is warmed to 50\u00b0C with stirring. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 136.9 g (627 mmol) of di-tert-butyl pyrocarbonate (Note 4) in 50 mL of alcohol-free chloroform. The nitrogen is turned off, and the solution of di-tert-butyl pyrocarbonate is added to the mixture at such a rate as to maintain steady but controlled gas evolution (Note 5). The stirred reaction mixture is heated at 60\u201365\u00b0C until gas evolution ceases, then allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring.\nSolvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure, and the resulting crude pink solid is dried overnight under high vacuum.

The flask is charged with 93 g (210 mmol) of lead tetraacetate (Note 9) and 250 mL of glacial acetic acid. Stirring is started, the flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and the funnel is charged with a solution of 61 g (200 mmol) of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methylene-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Note 10) in 250 mL of methylene chloride. This solution is added at such a rate that a temperature of 19\u201323\u00b0C is maintained throughout the addition, typically over a period of 15 to 20 min. The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. Glycerol (4 mL) is added to quench unreacted lead tetraacetate, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 10 min.\nThe mixture is poured into 750 mL of water in a 2-L separatory funnel and shaken thoroughly. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic layers are washed with 700 mL of water, followed by successive 100-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until no further effervescence is observed. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at reduced pressure to give a yellow-orange solid, which is dissolved in 100 mL of boiling acetone and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, then kept overnight at \u221220\u00b0C. Filtration affords a cream-colored solid in a yield of 51.2\u201352.2 g (Note 11), (Note 12). A second crop is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquors, dissolution in a minimal amount of boiling acetone, cooling and seeding. The total yield is brought to 58\u201359 g (90\u201392%).",

            "Lithium powder (7.55 g, 1.07 mol) is placed in a 500-mL, four-necked flask equipped with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and low-temperature thermometer (Note 1) and (Note 2). The apparatus is carefully flushed several times with nitrogen followed by the addition of 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). The reaction flask is cooled to approximately \u221260\u00b0C in a dry ice-acetone bath, and a mixture of freshly distilled (from CaH2) chlorotrimethylsilane (54.8 mL, 47.1 g, 0.43 mol) and tetrachlorosilane (Note 3) (10.1 mL, 15.0 g, 0.09 mol) in 140 mL of anhydrous THF is added over 1 hr by dropping funnel so that the temperature of the reaction mixture never exceeds \u221230\u00b0C. After addition is complete, stirring is continued for 0.5 hr with cooling (Note 4). The gold-brown suspension is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr, during which time the color becomes more intense (Note 5). The thermometer is removed and the mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hr to destroy the remaining chlorotrimethylsilane. After the condenser is cooled to room temperature, it is replaced with a nitrogen bubbler and gas inlet. Methyllithium-lithium bromide complex (66 mL, 99 mmol, 1.5 M in ether) is added over 3 hr to the grey-brown mixture with vigorous stirring (Note 6). During the addition a continuous stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the reaction mixture. After the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 16 hr at room temperature, it acquires a greenish tint. Hydrolysis is carried out by the careful addition of the reaction mixture to 400 mL of ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid. [CAUTION: The solid residue may be highly pyrophoric. The checkers blanketed the flask with argon prior to the introduction of ether (100 mL) and poured the vigorously stirred slurry into the cold hydrochloric acid. This rinse procedure was repeated twice more.] The aqueous phase is extracted four times with 200-mL portions of pentane, the combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvents removed under reduced pressure. Distillation under reduced pressure (1 mm, 38\u00b0C) affords 13.4\u201317.2 g of the product as a clear oil (60\u201377% yield)."

Rubber septa are used to isolate the system from atmospheric contact. Under a nitrogen purge, vented to an exhaust hood through a mercury bubbler, the entire system is thoroughly flame-dried (Note 1). After the 2-L flask is cooled to room temperature, it is charged with 500 mL of pure, dry 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 2) and 153 mL (1.53 mol) of borane-methyl sulfide complex (Note 3) employing a double-ended needle to effect the transfer. With a similar technique, 164 g (1.52 mol) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (Note 4) is transferred to the addition funnel. To the stirred borane solution, 1,5-cyclooctadiene is added dropwise over ca. 1 hr to maintain a reaction temperature of 50\u201360\u00b0C during which time a small amount of dimethyl sulfide (bp 38\u00b0C) distills slowly from the reaction mixture. After the addition is completed, the addition funnel is replaced with a glass stopper and approximately 300 mL of the solution is distilled to reach a final distillation temperature of 85\u00b0C, indicating the complete removal of dimethyl sulfide from the reaction mixture (Note 5). If the distillate temperature does not reach 85\u00b0C, 150 mL of additional 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added and the distillation is continued until the distillate temperature reaches 85\u00b0C. The distillation assembly is replaced with a rubber septum and 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added to the reaction flask to bring the total liquid volume to 1 L. The mixture is warmed to effect the dissolution of the solid and allowed to cool very slowly to 0\u00b0C, which results in the formation of crystalline 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) dimer. The supernatant liquid is decanted from the product using a double-ended needle and the 9-BBN dimer is dissolved in 1 L of fresh 1,2-dimethoxyethane. After the flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C, the supernatant liquid is removed as above and the large needles are dried under reduced pressure for 12 hr at 0.1 mm to give 158\u2013165 g (85\u201389%) of product (mp 152\u2013154\u00b0C, sealed capillary) (Note 6),(Note 7),(Note 8)."

            "Into a dry, one-necked, 2000-mL, round-bottomed flask is placed a medium-sized magnetic stirring bar (Note 1) and cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer [C5H5(CO)2Fe]2, (0.50 mol equiv, 0.21 mol, 74.4 g; (Note 2) and (Note 3)). Sodium dispersion (40% by weight) in light mineral oil (1.25 mol equiv, 0.52 mol, 30.1 g; (Note 4) and (Note 5)) is weighed into the flask (Note 6). The flask is then equipped with a reflux condenser topped with a three-way stopcock (Note 7) having a vertical tubulation capped with a septum through which solvents and reagents can be introduced with long needles or cannulas. By evacuation through the other tubulation of the stopcock, the apparatus is evacuated and filled with nitrogen twice, then placed under vacuum (\u22640.1 mm) for 1 to 2 hr to remove the bulk of the mineral oil. The flask is filled with nitrogen, and tetrahydrofuran (THF; 850 mL; (Note 8)) is transferred into the flask. Rapid stirring is begun and maintained while an oil bath or a heating mantle is employed to heat the mixture at reflux for \u2265 18 hr.\nThe flask is cooled to 0\u00b0C in an ice bath, and chloromethyl methyl sulfide (1.00 mol equiv, 0.42 mol, 35.2 ml) is added dropwise with a syringe over 25 min (Note 9) and (Note 10). After residues of the sulfide are rinsed into the flask with additional THF (ca. 5\u201310 mL), the mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0C for 1 hr and then at 25\u00b0C for 1 hr (Note 11). Iodomethane (1.30 mol equiv, 0.55 mol, 34.0 mL; (Note 12)) is added over 5 min using a syringe. After residues of iodomethane are rinsed into the flask with THF (5\u201310 mL), the mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0C for \u2265 15 hr. Stirring is stopped (Note 13), and the volatile materials are removed under vacuum (\u22640.1 mm) using a large, liquid nitrogen-cooled trap (Note 14). The vacuum in the apparatus is relieved with nitrogen, and the three-way stopcock is removed from the top of the condenser, exposing the reaction mixture to air.\nIn a 2000-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetic stirring bar, a solution of sodium tetrafluoroborate (6.00 mol equiv, 2.52 mol, 277 g) in water (1200 mL total volume of solution) is prepared and heated to 95\u00b0C while being stirred. A 1000-mL portion of the hot sodium tetrafluoroborate solution solution is slowly poured down the condenser into the reaction mixture which is kept at ca. 95\u00b0C while being stirred. At the same time, a 350-mL, medium-frit, sintered-glass B\u00fcchner funnel is prepared with a 2.5-cm layer of diatomaceous earth and a 1-cm layer of sand covered with a piece of filter paper with holes punched in it, and the funnel is preheated by passage, with suction, of 700\u20131000 mL of hot, distilled water which is then discarded. The condenser is removed from the reaction flask, and the contents are suction-filtered through the hot funnel into a heated, 2000-mL filter flask (Note 15). The remaining hot sodium tetrafluoroborate solution is used to rinse the reaction flask and the hot funnel. The combined filtrates are swirled while being cooled. If necessary, a seed crystal can be added. The filtration flask is placed in an ice bath while swirling is continued. After the temperature reaches 0\u00b0C, the flask is placed in a freezer at ca. \u221210\u00b0C for 1\u20133 hr. The product is collected by suction filtration using a large, chilled B\u00fcchner funnel (Whatman no. 1 filter paper) and is rinsed with ice-cold distilled water (150 mL) and cold diethyl ether (1500 mL). The filter cake is broken up, and the crystals are dried in a stream of air overnight. There is obtained 100.6 g (70.4%) of (\u03b75-C5H5)(CO)2FeCH2S+(CH3)2 BF4\u2212 as free-flowing, flake-like, amber crystals (Note 16),(Note 17),(Note 18). The yields were found to be considerably lower on runs of smaller scale (Note 19).\nInto a 200-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed the crystalline reagent (35 g, 0.10 mol; (Note 20)), 1,1-diphenylethene (9.1 mL, 9.3 g, 0.05 mol; (Note 21)), and dioxane (25 mL; (Note 22) and (Note 23)). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser topped with a stopcock, and a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 24) is established within the apparatus. While being stirred vigorously, the heterogeneous mixture is heated to reflux in an oil bath (120\u00b0C) for 14 hr (Note 25). The brown mixture is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool sufficiently to permit the addition of hexane (75 mL, (Note 26)) to the flask. The mixture is stirred in the air until the flask reaches 25\u00b0C. The supernatant liquid containing the product is poured from the flask and filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper. The remaining solid is repeatedly suspended and washed with several portions of hexane (ca. 1000 mL total; (Note 27)). The combined filtrates are filtered through a pad of silica gel in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel and are then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual dark brown oil is dissolved in methanol (200 mL) to give an orange-brown solution which immediately becomes dark green when solid ferric chloride (7 g; (Note 28)) is added at 25\u00b0C. The mixture is stirred for 15 min and then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual dark green oil is extracted with two 200-mL portions of hexane, and the combined extracts are filtered through a pad of silica gel and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The colorless oil that remains is distilled through a short-path apparatus to give 8.76 g (88%) of 1,1-diphenylcyclopropane as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 89\u00b0C (0.8 mm; lit3 110\u2013111\u00b0C, 1.3 mm; (Note 29)). The checkers obtained 65\u201377% yield of product on roughly half the scale."

The process is repeated three times; 0.15 mL (1.2 mmol) of chlorotrimethylsilane2 3 4 is then injected into the addition funnel. The cut zinc foil turns grey. After 15 min the reaction mixture is heated to 30\u00b0C with an oil bath and 18.9 g (60 mmol) of iodide 2 dissolved in 30 mL of THF is added dropwise over 40 min. After addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hr at 43\u00b0C to give a dark brown-yellow solution of the zinc reagent (Note 8).

The stopper is removed from the flask and replaced with a conical funnel while a rapid flow of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask. Lithium wire, 1% Na (9.48 g, 1.36 mol, 4.5 eq.) (Note 5), prewashed with hexanes, is held with forceps over the funnel and cut with clean scissors into pieces no larger than 2 mm in length (Note 6) so that the freshly cut lithium pieces drop directly into the anhydrous ether. 1,4-Dichlorobutane (33.5 mL, 300 mmol) (Note 2) is then dissolved in anhydrous diethyl ether (85 mL) and introduced into the addition funnel; approximately 10% of this solution is introduced into the lithium/ether suspension, and the reaction is initiated by vigorous stirring. A white precipitate (LiCl) signaling initiation of the reaction should be apparent within 5 to 15 min, at which time the remainder of the solution is added dropwise over a 1 to 2-hr period (Note 7). The white suspension is rapidly stirred for 20 hr at 0\u00b0C.\nThe mixture is most conveniently filtered by gravity filtration through an oven-dried coarse (15 \u03bcM) sintered glass frit (Note 8), (Note 9). The concentration of 1,4-dilithiobutane (2) in ether is determined by titration with sec-butyl alcohol using 1,10-phenanthroline as indicator. The molarity of the solution obtained under these optimized conditions is approximately 1.7 M in \"RLi\", i.e., 0.9 M in 1,4-dilithiobutane (2) (Note 10). This solution is stable for several months when stored at \u221210\u00b0C under nitrogen.",
            "C. 9,9-Dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-7-one (3).6,7 (All transfers are conducted under dry nitrogen; reagents are introduced into reaction vessels through rubber septa using a cannula or syringe.) An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a graduated addition funnel, overhead mechanical stirrer, and a nitrogen inlet. The flask is purged with nitrogen and charged with copper(I) thiophenoxide (36.7 g, 212 mmol) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) (Note 2), and the heterogeneous suspension is mechanically stirred while cooling in a \u221278\u00b0C cold bath (dry ice-acetone). 1,4-Dilithiobutane (2), 0.87 (\u00b1 0.02) M in diethyl ether (122 mL, 106 mmol) is added via the addition funnel over 5 min, and then the reaction mixture is allowed to slowly warm to \u221215\u00b0C (Note 11) over a 20 to 45-min period, during which time the initial yellow color changes to brown-red with concomitant dissolution of copper thiophenoxide. The addition funnel is washed with a few milliliters of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and a solution of 3-chloro-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (1) (15.85 g, 100 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) is added dropwise over a 1 to 2-hr period, while the temperature of the cold bath is maintained at \u221215\u00b0C to \u221220\u00b0C. The reaction turns olive-green and then black as the chloroenone is added. After the addition is complete, the cold bath is removed and the reaction flask is allowed to warm to room temperature.\nAfter 30 to 45 min, the reaction mixture is opened to the air and poured into approximately 500 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, diluted with approximately 500 mL of diethyl ether washings, and allowed to stir for 10 to 15 min. The resulting mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel, washing with small portions of diethyl ether (Note 12). The layers are separated in a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are washed with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over approximately 100 g of sodium sulfate, filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The concentrated product may still contain solid diphenyl disulfide that can now be efficiently removed by chromatography of the neat crude product mixture through a 5-cm diameter \u00d7 10-cm height silica gel column and elution with hexane-diethyl ether (7:1) (Note 13). Evaporation of solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure gives 13.28 g (74% yield) of 9,9-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-7-one (3) as a pale yellow to colorless oil (Note 14)."

After the flask is purged with dry argon, it is charged with 22.0 g (0.10 mol) of finely ground iodosobenzene (Note 7), 200 mL of chloroform (Note 8) and 17.0 g (0.11 mol) of 1-trimethylsilyl-1-hexyne, and the entire mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice-water bath. Boron trifluoride etherate (Note 9), 13.0 mL (0.11 mol), is added dropwise over a period of about 5 min to the stirred, cooled reaction mixture (Note 10). After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 16 hr (Note 11).\nTo a 1-L beaker are added 76.1 g (0.4 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 12) and 400 mL of water. To this solution is carefully added 21.2 g (0.2 mol) of anhydrous sodium carbonate and then the entire solution is purged with argon for about 15 min to replace all air. This solution of sodium toluenesulfonate (NaOTs), along with the contents of the reaction flask, are placed in a 1-L separatory funnel and the mixture is vigorously shaken for a period of about 10 min (Note 13).

After the flask is purged with argon, it is charged with 0.90 g (37.5 mmol) of magnesium turnings and 15 mL of anhydrous ether. To the dropping funnel is added a solution of 4.0 mL (37.5 mmol) of 1-bromobutane (Note 15) in 20 mL of anhydrous ether. This solution is added to the reaction flask at such a rate (approximately 1 hr) that after the Grignard reaction is initiated a gentle reflux is maintained. After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min.\nThe center neck of a dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (equipped with a magnetic stirrer system) is fitted with a 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel topped off with a rubber septum and an argon inlet. The side necks are fitted with a glass stopper and a rubber septum, respectively. The apparatus is purged with argon and to the flask are added 7.7 g (37.5 mmol) of copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (Note 16), 60 mL of anhydrous ether, and 38 mL of dimethyl sulfide (Note 17). The mixture is cooled to \u221270\u00b0C with a dry ice-2-propanol slush bath. The previously prepared butyl Grignard reagent is transferred to the addition funnel via a double-ended needle with a positive argon pressure. The Grignard reagent is added dropwise, over a 30-min period, to the cooled reaction mixture (Note 18). After the addition is complete the reaction is maintained between \u221240\u00b0C to \u221250\u00b0C for 2 hr, then recooled to \u221270\u00b0C. Phenylacetylene (Note 19), 4.1 mL (37.1 mmol), is slowly added via a syringe through the rubber septum. After addition, the reaction mixture is maintained at \u221230\u00b0C to \u221225\u00b0C for 2 hr (Note 20), then recooled to \u221270\u00b0C and 6.8 g (15 mmol) of the previously prepared iodonium tosylate is added, in the solid form, through the side neck, over a positive argon pressure. The stirring reaction mixture is gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 hr at room temperature. The mixture is poured into a 1-L beaker containing 200 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and stirred vigorously. The undissolved materials are filtered off and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phase are washed with 100 mL of water followed by 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator in the hood and the residual oil chromatographed (4 \u00d7 50 cm column) on alumina (600 g, (Note 21)).

Stirring is begun and 1000 g (7.50 mol) of anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 4) is added, followed by an additional 500 mL of dry nitromethane. After the reaction mixture cools to room temperature, the gas inlet is replaced with a Gooch tube attached to a 500-mL filter flask containing 295 g (2.5 mol) of powdered succinic acid (Note 5). The nitrogen line is now attached to the sidearm of this flask. The succinic acid is introduced in portions during 1.5 hr (CAUTION: This process evolves a large volume of hydrogen chloride gas which may cause the mixture to foam. Small quantities of the acid should be added at a time and the foaming should be allowed to subside prior to introduction of the next amount). The mixture is stirred for 2 hr and the Gooch tube is replaced by a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel equipped with a nitrogen inlet.

This mixture is added dropwise to the cooled, stirred suspension over 1.5 hr. During the addition, there is a visible evolution of gas, the mixture darkens, and a paste-like precipitate forms. At the completion of the addition, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred an additional 1.5 hr, until gas evolution has ceased. The stirred reaction mixture is then diluted with 1.5 L of anhydrous ether (Note 6). The suspension is filtered through an 18.5-cm B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with two Whatman 1 filter papers and the solid is washed with two 500-mL portions of anhydrous ethyl ether. The solid is transferred to a 19 \u00d7 10-cm evaporating dish and dried under reduced pressure in a vacuum desiccator to afford crude sodium salt of 1 (270\u2013280 g) as a colorless or slightly tan hygroscopic solid. The material is carried on directly in the continuation of this procedure.\nA 4-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a 2-in Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar is charged with 1.5 L of deionized water and placed in an ice bath. To the stirring water is added in small portions ( CAUTION, (Note 7)) the crude sodium salt of 1. When all of the salt has dissolved, the cooled, dark brown solution is acidified to pH 5 (Hydrion paper) by dropwise addition of concd hydrochloric acid. The resultant two-phase mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel and the Erlenmeyer flask is washed with two 100-mL portions of ethyl ether which are added to the separatory funnel. An additional 800 mL of ether is added to the mixture. The upper (organic) and lower (aqueous) phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted six additional times (Note 8) with 400 mL of ether each time.

The addition funnel is charged with 500 mL of the 60:40 benzene/methanol mixture. The magnetically stirred solution is warmed to a gentle reflux at which time the solution begins to darken to a light brown color. The distillation temperature rises to 59\u00b0C (the boiling point of the benzene/methanol azeotrope) and stabilizes. The distillate volume is monitored throughout the course of the reaction. When 250 mL of distillate has collected, the reaction vessel is replenished with 250 mL of fresh benzene/methanol mixture. This cycle is repeated 6 times until starting material is consumed (Note 12). At this time any residual benzene/methanol mixture in the addition funnel is discarded and the funnel is charged with 500 mL of benzene. The reaction volume is maintained by the addition of benzene as the boiling point of the distillate rises to 79\u00b0C. In this way, a total of 750 mL of benzene is distilled out of the reaction mixture as the reaction is driven to completion. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is quenched by the addition of 500 mL of 1.0 M aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The two phase mixture is stirred for 5 min and then transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel.

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 5.2 g (0.22 g-atom) of magnesium turnings is equipped with a rubber septum, a reflux condenser, an addition funnel and a magnetic stirring bar. The system is flame-dried and flushed with nitrogen. A few crystals of iodine and 150 mL of anhydrous ether (Note 1) are introduced. As the contents of the flask are stirred, 25.8 g (0.21 mol) of (chloromethyl)trimethylsilane (Note 2) is added in small portions until the reaction begins, and then at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing of the ether. The addition requires about 30 min, after which the mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 30 min. The solution is cooled to room temperature and is used directly for the next reaction.",
            "C. (E,E)-Trimethyl(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)silane.

A 2-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen line attached to a bubbler, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, an overhead stirrer and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 215 g (0.5 mol) of (carbethoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide and 1.1 L of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Note 1) and (Note 2). The stirred suspension is cooled in an ice water bath and treated with 150 mL (1.1 mol) of triethylamine (Note 3) added dropwise over 5 min. After the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at 5\u00b0C, it is treated dropwise with 78 mL (116 g, 0.55 mol) of trifluoroacetic anhydride (Note 4) in such a manner that the reaction temperature is maintained between 5\u201310\u00b0C, which results in a total addition time of approximately 1 hr. The mixture is allowed to stir for 2 hr and subsequently filtered, the precipitate is washed three times with cold THF and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a yellow oily residue. Trituration of the residue with 600 mL of water affords a crystalline product which is collected, washed three times with 100 mL of water, and dried by suction to afford 208 g of a yellowish colored solid (Note 5). The solid is dissolved in 900 mL of hot methanol; the solution is filtered, treated with 500 mL of water, and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline product is collected, washed three times with 100 mL of cold water and dried under reduced pressure to afford 200\u2013208 g (89\u201393%) of ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetoacetate as a very pale-yellow, crystalline solid (Note 6).",
            "B. Ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorotetrolate. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient magnetic stirrer, a heating mantle, a thermocouple (Note 7) and a large bore gas exit tube (Figure 1, (Note 8)). To this flask are added 200 g (0.45 mol) of ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetoacetate and 40 g of potassium carbonate (Note 9). The gas exit tube is connected to a Dewar condenser, modified with a side arm connection, which has a round-bottomed flask for collection of the product in a dry ice-acetone bath. A second trap is placed between the reaction setup and the vacuum pump, all the traps are cooled with dry ice-acetone, and the system is evacuated to 1\u20132 mm. The reaction flask is carefully heated to 150\u00b0C (Note 10) at which point the phosphorane melts and the acetylene evolution begins. The molten phosphorane is stirred and heated from 160\u00b0C to 220\u00b0C over a period of 5 hr. Heating is carefully increased during the reaction in order to control the rate of distillation of the acetylenic product. From the round-bottomed flask in the cold trap is obtained 65\u201367 g (87\u201389%) of a clear, slightly yellow, liquid. The thermolysis product is dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered through Celite. Distillation at atmospheric pressure through a short-path distillation apparatus affords about 1.0 g of forerun and 59\u201361 g (79\u201382%) of ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorotetrolate as an analytically pure, colorless liquid, bp760 97\u2013100\u00b0C (Note 11).\nFigure 1"

            "Liquid ammonia (350 mL) is dried over sodium amide for 20 min (Note 1), then distilled under a positive pressure of dry nitrogen into a flame-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dry ice condenser, rubber septum and magnetic stirring bar. The flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and small pieces of lithium (1.11 g, 0.16 mol) (Note 2) are added over 10 min to afford a deep blue solution. A solution of enone 1 (10.08 g, 0.07 mol) (Note 3) in tert-butyl alcohol (5.10 g, 0.07 mol) (Note 4) and ether (40 mL) (Note 5) is added dropwise over a 15-min period at \u221278\u00b0C, and then sufficient isoprene (Note 6) is added dropwise to discharge the residual blue color of the reaction mixture. The ammonia is allowed to evaporate under a stream of dry nitrogen and the ether is removed under reduced pressure to leave a white foam. After a further 5 min under high vacuum, the nitrogen atmosphere is restored, the lithium enolate 2 is suspended in dry ether (80 mL) at \u221278\u00b0C by vigorous stirring, and methyl cyanoformate (6.73 g, 0.08 mol) (Note 7) is added over a 5-min period. Stirring is maintained at this temperature for a further 40 min and then the mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0C. Water (500 mL) and ether (200 mL) are added and the mixture is stirred vigorously until the precipitate has dissolved. After separation of the organic layer, the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (2 \u00d7 300 mL), the combined extracts are washed with water (200 mL) and brine (200 mL) (Note 8), and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure furnishes a pale yellow oil which is dissolved in hexane (200 mL); the solution is kept in the freezer (\u221228\u00b0C) for approximately 1.5 hr, after which time very pale yellow crystals of the \u03b2-keto ester 3 are deposited. These are collected by filtration at low temperature and after concentration of the mother liquors, two further crops are collected. Flash chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 13:87) on silica gel (140 g) (Note 9) of the residue (3.5 g) from the remaining mother liquor followed by two recrystallizations affords further 3. The total quantity of 3 obtained is 11.5\u201311.8 g (81\u201384% yield) (Note 10)."

            "In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar is placed 2.64 g (8.00 mmol) of sodium tungstate dihydrate (Note 1). After the flask is flushed with nitrogen, 40 mL of water and 23.5 mL (200 mmol) of 2-methylpiperidine (Note 2) are added. The flask is cooled with an ice-salt bath to \u22125\u00b0C (internal temperature) and 45.0 mL (440 mmol) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (Note 3) is added dropwise over a period of ca. 30 min. During the period of addition the reaction mixture should be carefully kept at a temperature below 20\u00b0C (Note 4). The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 3 hr (Note 5). Excess hydrogen peroxide is decomposed by adding ca. 3 g of sodium hydrogen sulfite with ice cooling (Note 6). The solution is saturated by adding ca. 25 g of sodium chloride and extracted with ten 200-mL portions of dichloromethane (Note 7). Combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator keeping the temperature at 40\u00b0C (Note 8) to give a pale yellow oil (20.0\u201322.0 g), which may be sufficiently pure for some applications (Note 9). Purification of the nitrone is achieved by column chromatography on 300 g of silica gel packed in 97:3 chloroform/methanol in a 4.8-cm \u00d7 70-cm column (Note 10). The product is applied to the column in 10 mL of chloroform and the column is eluted with 97:3 chloroform/methanol. After twenty 100-mL fractions are collected, the eluent is changed to 8:2 chloroform/methanol, and another ten 100-mL fractions are collected and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Note 11). Combination of fractions 16\u201330 and evaporation provides 14.0\u201315.7 g (62\u201370%) of pure 6-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine N-oxide as a pale yellow oil (Note 12) and (Note 13)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum-capped pressure-equalizing addition funnel on the center neck, rubber septum on one side neck, and a nitrogen inlet with stopcock on the other side neck is charged in a nitrogen-filled glove box (Note 1) with 27.0 g (92.5 mmol) of zirconocene dichloride [(\u03b7-C5H5)2ZrCl2] (Note 2), 150 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 3), and 16.0 mL (204 mmol) of 2-butyne (Note 4) added via syringe. The apparatus is removed from the glove box and attached via the nitrogen stopcock to a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C (dry ice-acetone bath) and 108 mL of 1.72 M butyllithium (186 mmol) in hexane (Note 5) is added via syringe to the addition funnel through the septum. The butyllithium solution is added dropwise to the stirred mixture in the flask. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 10 min (Note 6). The flask is allowed to warm by removing the dry ice-acetone bath, and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hr at which point the mixture is dark orange-red (Note 7). The flask is again cooled to \u221278\u00b0C, and 17.5 mL (129 mmol) of dichlorophenylphosphine (Note 8) is added in a slow stream via syringe through the septum on the flask. The dry ice-acetone bath is removed and the flask is allowed to warm to room temperature. After 1 hr the orange-red color has dissipated and the septa are replaced with glass stoppers. The nitrogen inlet is connected to a vacuum line (0.1 mm) and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The stopcock is closed and the apparatus is placed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (Note 1). The reaction residue is extracted three times with 30-mL portions of hexane, each of which is filtered from the precipitate of (\u03b7-C5H5)2ZrCl2 and combined. The hexane is removed under reduced pressure (0.5 mm), and the oily liquid that remains is transferred into a 100-mL round-bottomed flask. The flask is attached to a vacuum distillation apparatus with a 10-cm Vigreux column. The distillation apparatus is removed from the glove box and attached to a vacuum line. Distillation at 0.35 mm yields a fraction which is collected between 40\u201392\u00b0C and discarded. A second fraction boiling between 92\u2013104\u00b0C (Note 9) is collected; the clear oily liquid is 1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylphosphole [14.9\u201315.5 g, 75\u201378% based on (\u03b7-C5H5)2ZrCl2)] (Note 10). The compound is air-sensitive and should be stored under nitrogen."
