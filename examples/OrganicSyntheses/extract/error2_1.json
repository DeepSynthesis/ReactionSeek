            "A. Tripent-4-enyl borate (1). A 300-mL, three-necked, flame-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated stir bar (3 cm), two septa (Necks 1 and 3) and a Dean-Stark trap (20 mL, Neck 2) wrapped in aluminum foil and fitted with a reflux condenser (20 cm), and a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor (Note 1) is charged with boric acid (886 mg, 14.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2), toluene (70 mL) (Note 3), and 4-penten-1-ol (4.48 mL, 43.4 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 2) at room temperature (Figure 1). The resulting suspension is slowly heated in an oil bath (135-136 \u00b0C) to reflux over 30 min and heating is continued at reflux for 1.5 h (Note 4). The reaction mixture turns homogeneous after 50 min of heating.\nFigure 1. Apparatus Assembly for Step A\nAfter heating at reflux for 1.5 h, the flask is removed from the oil bath and stirred at room temperature for 10 min before the septum (Neck 1) is replaced with a thermometer adaptor/thermometer (Note 5) and the Dean-Stark trap/reflux condenser (Neck 2) is replaced with a dry reflux condenser (20 cm) equipped with a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor (Figure 2). The resulting apparatus is further cooled for 20 min with the aid of an ice/water bath (Note 4) to 23-24 \u00b0C (internal temperature). The cooling bath is removed and the in situ generated tripent-4-enyl borate used directly for the next step (Note 6).\nFigure 2. Apparatus Assembly for Step B",
            "B. Tris[5-(bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV)chloride)pentyl] borate (2). To the clear tripent-4-enyl borate solution is quickly added THF (50 mL) by syringe (Note 3), followed by Cp2ZrHCl (14.7 g, 57.0 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 7) in one portion via a powder funnel (Neck 3) at 24 \u00b0C (internal temperature) (Note 8). The resulting white suspension (Figure 3) bubbles gently for approximately 5 s, turns yellow/orange in color (Figure 4), and then clear (Figure 5) after approximately 15 min (Note 9). The hydrozirconation reaction is complete after 2 h (Note 10), and the solution of the alkyl zirconocene product formed is used without purification for the next step.\nFigure 3.

To the crude tris[5-(bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV)chloride)pentyl] borate solution is added 2-cyclohexen-1-one (4.58 mL, 47.3 mmol, 3.3 equiv) by syringe (Notes 8 and 11) followed by CuBr\u25cfMe2S (884 mg, 4.30 mmol, 0.3 equiv) (Note 8) via a powder funnel (Neck 3) in one portion at 24 \u00b0C. A strongly exothermic reaction ensues upon addition of CuBr\u25cfMe2S, with the reaction temperature rising from 24 \u00b0C to 38 \u00b0C within 10 min (Note 12). The heterogeneous reaction mixture turns black (Figure 6) (Note 13) and the conjugate addition reaction is found to be complete after 2 h (Note 14).\nFigure 6. Black solution formed in Step C\nThe reaction is quenched by pouring the reaction mixture into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask that contains a concentrated NH4OH solution (150 mL) (Note 3) and a Teflon-coated stir bar (5.0 cm). The remaining residue in the three-necked, round-bottomed flask is transferred to the Erlenmeyer flask with an ether wash (100 mL) (Note 3) and the resulting heterogeneous, biphasic, grey mixture is vigorously stirred at room temperature for 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, the mixture turns light blue in color (Figure 7) and is suction filtered (37 mmHg) through a 350-mL glass filter (porosity: 40-60 \u00b5m) into a 1000-mL filtration flask. The resulting pale blue solids and the 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask are washed with deionized water (3 x 40 mL) followed by ether (3 x 40 mL), and the filtrate is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel (Figure 8).\nFigure 7. Light blue solution formed in Step C\nThe dark yellow ether layer is removed and the dark blue aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 x 100 mL). The ether extracts are combined in a 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask, dried over Na2SO4 (20.3 g, 15 min) (Note 15) and filtered (slight over pressure of air) through a plug of SiO2 (25.0 g, height = 10.0 cm, diameter = 2.5 cm) into a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask with excess ether (100 mL), which is also used to rinse the Erlenmeyer flask. The yellow filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 to 50 \u00b0C/50 mmHg) and the resulting oil (Note 16) is loaded with a 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc solution (10.0 mL) onto a 4.5-cm diameter flash column, dry packed (pre-flushed with 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc solution until uniformly solvated) with SiO2 (162 g) (Note 17). Following the sample addition, the column is eluted with a 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc solution (1.6 L total volume, 33 mL/min. average flow rate) and the first 325 mL of eluent are collected as one fraction.\nFigure 8. Biphasic solution in separatory funnel\nAt this time, a yellow band (Note 18) begins to elute from the column and fractions 60 mL in volume are collected. The desired product elutes over fractions 13-52 and a sample of the desired product enriched with the regioisomeric byproduct 3-(5-hydroxypentan-2-yl)cyclohexanone (4) is isolated over fractions 53-60 (Notes 19 and 20). Fractions 13-52 are combined (each test tube is rinsed with ether (2 mL)), concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 to 40 \u00b0C/50 mmHg), transferred to a pre-weighed 50-mL round-bottomed flask with ether (10 mL), re-concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 to 40 \u00b0C/50 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (14 mmHg, 12 h) to afford 3-(5-hydroxypentyl)cyclohexan-1-one (3) as a pale yellow oil (5.20 g, 66%) (Notes 21 and 22)."

The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 \u00baC for 10 min, and after the removal of the rubber septum, phenylsulfonylnitromethane (R) (6.91 g, 34.3 mmol, 1.30 equiv) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 4.19 g, 34.3 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Note 14) are added through the open neck at 0 \u00baC and then the flask is resealed with a rubber septum. After the mixture is vigorously stirred at 0 \u00baC for 30 min, the reaction continues at room temperature for 72 h with vigorous stirring (Note 15) (Figure 1). The resulting solution is concentrated using a rotary evaporator (25 \u00baC, 25 mmHg) until about half of the solution remains (Note 16). After the addition of methanol (60 mL) to the concentrated mixture, the mixture is cooled to 0 \u00baC in an ice bath. To the cold reaction mixture, 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU, 11.9 mL, 79.2 mmol, 3.00 equiv) (Note 4) is added over the course of 2 min, and the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min in the ice bath. After the ice bath is replaced with a Dewar bath containing dry ice/acetone, a glass tube is connected via Teflon tubing to an ozone (O3) generator. The glass tube is inserted into the reaction solution through the open neck of the flask, and ozone is bubbled through the reaction mixture for 2 h at -78 \u00baC (Note 17) (Figure 2). After the ozonolysis is completed, the reaction mixture is purged sequentially with oxygen for 5 min and then with argon for another 5 min in order to remove excess ozone from the reaction mixture. Then, dimethyl sulfide (2.52 mL, 34.3 mmol, 1.30 equiv) (Notes 18 and 19) is added to the reaction mixture at -78 \u00baC to quench any peroxides present and the solution is allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for 1 hr.

The (R)-bromonitroalkane2 (1) (8.90 g, 19.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 1:1 dr, 99/99% ee), D-phenylalanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (7.10 g, 23.7 mmol, 1.2 equiv), and cesium carbonate (20.64 g, 63.1 mmol, 3.2 equiv) (Note 3) are loaded into the flask. Deionized water (35 mL) and 2-Me-THF (200 mL) (Note 4) are poured into the vessel through the neck bearing the glass stopper. An oxygen balloon is then placed into the septum, and the bright yellow mixture is stirred at maximum speed at room temperature for 7 min (Figure 1a). N-Iodosuccinimide (4.47 g, 19.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is then added in one portion through the neck bearing the glass stopper (dark yellow mixture to brown mixture, Figures 1b-d).

The mixture is then poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, using EtOAc (50 mL) to rinse the remaining mixture into the funnel. The organic and aqueous layers are separated, and the latter is extracted with EtOAc (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (25 g) (Note 8), filtered, and concentrated to a red oil in a 1-L round-bottomed flask by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 110-80 mmHg) (Figure 2a). The oil is transferred onto a pad of silica (8 cm tall by 7 cm wide), using dichloromethane (10 mL) to retrieve the residual oil and EtOAc:hexanes (1:1) (30 mL) to rinse the flask. The silica is then flushed with EtOAc:hexanes (1:1) (600 mL) into a 1-L round-bottomed flask and is concentrated to a red solid by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 110-80 mmHg). The material is subjected to high vacuum (0.25 mmHg) for 1 h. To the crude solid is added toluene/cyclohexane (3:2) (50 mL) and heated in a warm water bath (70 \u00b0C) until all solids are dissolved (Note 9). The flask is then removed from the water bath, capped with a plastic stopper, and allowed to cool to room temperature (25 \u00b0C) for 2 h. The flask is cooled to 0 \u00baC in a freezer for 19 h. The suspension is vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (7 cm diameter), fitted with filter paper. Cold cyclohexane (3 x 25 mL) is used to rinse the remaining powder from the round-bottomed flask onto the filter cake (Figure 2b).

The color of the solution changes from colorless to yellow upon the addition of silver bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide into the solution, while white silver chloride precipitation is observed. (Figure 3)\nBoth necks of the flask are fitted with septa. The reaction mixture is heated in a 60 \u00b0C oil bath and stirred for 24 h. During its course, the reaction turns progressively from yellow to orange and finally to black (Figure 4).\nFigure 3. Apparatus Assembly in Step B\nFigure 4. Progression of color from yellow to black in Step B\nA 150 mL B\u00fcchner funnel with fritted disc (diameter: 7 cm) is mounted on the top of a 250 mL one-necked round-bottomed flask and charged with 10.5 g celite (Note 7). While the funnel is connected to a vacuum source (375 mmHg), THF (10 mL) (Note 8) is poured into the funnel, followed by the reaction mixture, and THF (2 x 10 mL) (Note 8). The filtrate is washed with 50 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 9), and the aqueous solution is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL) (Note 10). The combined organic layers are dried for 20 min over Na2SO4 (15 g) (Note 11). The volatiles are removed by rotatory evaporation (30 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C bath temperature), and then under a higher vacuum for 4 h (1 mmHg) (Note 12). The resulting solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 10), and 10 g silica gel (Note 13) is added into the solution. After removing the solvent by rotatory evaporation (300 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature), the silica gel with adsorbed crude material is charged on a silica gel (Note 13) column (5 cm diameter x 15 cm height). The column is packed with hexanes (800 mL) and eluted with hexanes/ethyl acetate (20/1, 1.3 L) using compressed air (2 atm) (Notes 14 and 15). Fractions 42-58 (Note 16) containing the pure product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature). The resultant solid is dried under high vacuum (1.0 mmHg) for 10 h to afford indole 6 (7.77 g, 90% yield) as a white solid (Note 17) (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. White solid produced in Step B"

            "Fac-tris(2-phenylpyridinato) iridium(III) (A). Iridium (III) chloride anhydrous (0.65 g , 2.18 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2), 2-phenylpyridine (3.74 mL, 26.1 mmol, 12.0 equiv) (Note 3), and 0.65 L of DI water (0.003 M with respect to IrCl3) is added to a 1 L Parr reactor (Figure 1) (Notes 4, 5, and 6). The reaction mixture is pressurized with argon (10.0 psi), stirred and then depressurized three times, and finally charged again with argon before sealing (Note 7). The reaction mixture is heated to 205 \u00b0C for 48 h. Then the reactor is cooled to 20 \u2070C with internal cooling coils. At the end of the experiment the reactor was left in the stand and the contents cooled to 20 \u00b0C using cold water. After cooling, the reactor is opened revealing an insoluble yellow solid on the surfaces (Figure 2) and dispersed in the aqueous phase (Note 8). All contents are transferred slowly to a 6 L separatory funnel aided by a large 5 cm glass funnel. Then the interior of the reactor is mechanically scraped (to extract the yellow material), with metal tongs, cotton balls (25 in total), and 500 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) from a spray bottle, and again all contents are added to the separatory funnel (Notes 9 and 10).\nFigure 1. a) 1 L Parr stirred reactor used for the reaction b) 4843 controller\nFigure 2. An example of the insoluble yellow solid found on the internal components after a successful reaction\nWhile still in the funnel, the cotton is rinsed with 25 mL of DCM from a spray bottle and evenly pressed with tongs to release the yellow material from the cotton (Note 9). After removing the cotton, the solution is then diluted with 2.5 L of DCM. The separatory funnel is shaken vigorously, allowed to settle and again shaken, and the organic layer is then slowly separated from the aqueous layer (Notes 11, 12 and 13) and the aqueous layer is further extracted with more DCM (3 x 10 mL), and the organic layers are combined (Note 14). The aqueous layers are kept for future ligand recovery. The combined organic layer is washed with a 1 M HCl solution, with vigorous mixing prior to separation (3 x 900 mL). Each HCl wash is then back extracted with DCM (3 x 10 mL) to insure complete recovery of the product. After the final wash, the organic layer is filtered slowly (20 min) through a Celite (35 g) pad on top of a 150 mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, into a 3 L round-bottomed flask, and then dried with 30 g of MgSO4. After filtering the drying reagent using a 4 L Erlenmyer flask fitted with a 5 cm funnel/cotton plug, a homogenous aliquot is removed for NMR analysis (Note 15). Finally, the solvent is removed in batches by transferring to a 2.5 L round-bottomed flask by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 30 mm Hg, 150 rpm) to afford 1.35 g (94%) of Ir(ppy)3 as a bright yellow solid (Note 16).\nFurther purification of Ir(ppy)3 can be performed by adding the yellow solid to a 1 L round-bottomed flask and adding 600 mL of distilled hexanes. The solid material is then sonicated until a uniform slurry is achieved, and 5 mL of dichloromethane is added (Note 17). The liquid is swirled giving a slight yellow tint to the solution indicating successful dissolution of a colored compound, and selective extraction of the impurities. Then the slurry is slowly poured through a 50 mL fine porosity sintered glass funnel to collect the yellow solid, and the filtrate is collected into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. The yellow solid is air dried on the filter to afford 1.29 g (91%) (Notes 18 and 19) of the product in >97% purity (Notes 20 and 21)."

A 500 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3 cm stirrer bar and a needle-pierced septum is charged with methyl (tert-butoxycarbonyl)-glycinate 1 (Note 2) (6.80 g, 36.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) and methanol (Note 3) (225 mL). 1-Amino pyridinium iodide (Note 4) (6.67 g, 30.0 mmol) is added and the reaction is stirred for 5 min at 22 \u00b0C. Potassium carbonate (Note 5) (9.95 g, 72.0 mmol, 2.40 equiv) is added and the reaction is stirred at 22 \u00b0C for 64 h (Note 6) (the yellow heterogeneous reaction turns colorless two seconds after the addition of potassium carbonate, and forms a dark purple solution, Figure 1). After removal of the stir bar, 200 mL of the methanol is removed under reduced pressure (200 mmHg to 70 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a brown-purple syrup, which is poured onto an alumina pad (Notes 7 and 8).\nFigure 1. Change in reaction color: a) Reaction mixture before potassium carbonate addition; b) Reaction mixture 10 seconds after potassium carbonate addition; c) Reaction mixture after 64 h\nThe flask is rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane as well as 50 mL of eluent (dichloromethane-methanol, 9:1), and the product is eluted with 1.1 L of dichloromethane-methanol (9:1) (Note 9). The filtrate is concentrated (375 mmHg to 75 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then transferred to a 500 mL single-necked round-bottomed flask and rinsed with dichloromethane (20 mL). The filtrate is concentrated further (375 mmHg to 15 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then dried under vacuum (0.08 mmHg, 20 \u00b0C, 1 h) to give a brown powder (Note 10). A 3 cm Teflon coated stirrer bar is added, followed by acetone (175 mL) (Note 11). A water-cooled condenser is added to the flask and the mixture is heated to reflux until complete dissolution had occurred (15 min). The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature over 3 h and then cooled to -22 \u00b0C in a freezer for 20 h. The resultant fine brown crystals are filtered off through a sintered S3 funnel, the flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (Note 12) (3 x 25 mL), and the contents were then added to the funnel.\nFigure 2. Compound 2 after recrystallization from acetone\nThe powder is transferred to a 50 mL single-necked flask and dried under static vacuum (0.12 mmHg, 18 h) (6.39 g, 85%, 98% purity) (Figure 2) (Notes 13, 14, and 15).",

A three-necked 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum, a glass stopper, a vacuum tap and 2 cm Teflon coated stirrer bar is flame-dried under vacuum (0.12 mmHg) for 1 min and then backfilled with nitrogen. The evacuation/nitrogen purge is repeated a total of 3 times, and then the reaction vessel is allowed to cool to room temperature (22 \u00b0C) under a positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is sequentially charged with N-benzyl-4-methyl-N-(phenylethynyl)benzene-sulfonamide (Note 16) (4.69 g, 13.0 mmol), dichloro(2-pyridinecarboxylato)gold (Note 17) (51.02 mg, 0.13 mmol) and ((tert-butoxycarbonyl)glycyl)(pyridin-1-ium-1-yl)amide (3.60 g, 14.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv). Toluene (130 mL) (Note 18) is added and the flask is placed in a preheated aluminium mantle and stirred at 90 \u00b0C (controlled by an external probe) for 5.5 h (Note 19). The heterogeneous mixture becomes a homogenous orange-brown solution over the first hour (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. a) Reaction set-up for Step B; b) Reaction progress monitored by TLC. From left to right: Compound 3, control spot and reaction mixture\nUpon completion, the flask is removed from the heating mantle and the reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature for 1 h. The crude reaction mixture is filtered through a silica pad (Note 20) and then the reaction flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL) (Note 21), which is then added to the silica pad. The pad is then flushed with ethyl acetate (320 mL) into a 1 L single-necked round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (150-75 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The product is transferred, with the assistance of ethyl acetate washes (2 x 10 mL), to a 250 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask and evaporated further (160 mmHg to 30 mmHg). The resultant white-yellowish solid is then broken up with a glass rod (Figure 4a). A 3 cm Teflon coated stir bar is added followed by ethanol (Note 22) (150 mL), and the flask is equipped with a water-cooled condenser. The flask is heated to reflux in an aluminium heating mantle and stirred for 25 min until complete dissolution to give a yellow solution. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature and then placed in a freezer at -22 \u00b0C for 19 h. The resultant crystals were filtered off and washed with hexane (3 x 25 mL) (Note 23) to give fine off-white crystals (Figure 4b).\nThe crystals are transferred to a 100 mL single-necked flask and then toluene (30 mL) (Note 24) is added to give a slightly grey suspension (Figure 4c). The solvents are removed under reduced pressure (75 mmHg to 35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and then the product is dried under vacuum (0.14 mmHg, 1 h, room temperature) to give a fine off white powder (Figure 4d) (Note 25). The powder is transferred to a 250 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask (using 10 mL dichloromethane to rinse the flask) containing a 3 cm Teflon coated stir bar. Dichloromethane (80 mL) is added, the mixture is stirred for 10 min and then the yellow solution (Figure 4e) is filtered through cotton wool (Note 26), which is then washed with dichloromethane (4 x 10 mL), eluting under gravity into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask (Note 27). The solvent is evaporated (450 mmHg - 35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a white solid (Figure 4f), which is broken up with a glass rod and then dried under vacuum (60 \u00b0C, 0.12 mmHg, 96 h) (6.67 g, 96%, >99% purity) (Notes 28, 29, 30, and 31).\nFigure 4. a) Solid after filtration through a silica pad; b) Solid after first crystallization; c) Grey suspension of the white crystals in toluene; d) The final product before filtration through cotton; e) Yellow solution of the product before filtration through cotton; f) Compound 4"

Pivalic acid (12.5 mL, 11.3 g, 110 mmol, 2.2 equiv) (Note 3) is added to form a colorless solution. Zinc oxide (4.07 g, 50 mmol, 1 equiv) is added in 1 g portions at 25 \u00baC over 15 min to form a colorless suspension (Note 4). The flask is equipped with a Dean-Stark trap (10 mL) wrapped in aluminum foil and topped with a reflux condenser (20 cm) and the suspension is stirred under nitrogen at reflux in an oil bath for 16 h (Figure 1) (Note 5).\nFigure 1: Step A - Dean-Stark trap and evaporation of remaining pivalic acid and water with a liquid nitrogen cold trap\nA viscous colorless suspension is formed overnight. After cooling to 25 \u00baC, the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C/50 mmHg). The remaining pivalic acid and water are removed in vacuo from the reaction mixture using a vacuum line (0.1 mmHg) and a liquid nitrogen cold trap (1000 mL) (see Figure 1). The white solid is warmed to 100 \u00b0C in an oil bath and dried for at least 6 h (Note 6). Zinc pivalate (13.1-13.2 g, 48.9-49.7 mmol, 98-99%), is obtained as a puffy amorphous white solid (Note 7).",

A dry and argon flushed 1 L Schlenk-flask equipped with a 5\u00d72-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a septum is filled with argon and then weighed. 3-Bromopyridine (6.32 g, 40.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 8) and dry THF (50 mL, 0.8 M) are added to the flask via syringe (Note 9). The solution is cooled in an ice-water bath under an atmosphere of argon and stirred for at least 5 min at 0 \u00b0C before iPrMgCl\u00b7LiCl (35.2 mL, 1.25 M, 44.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 10) is added via a syringe pump over the period of 30 min (Note 11). The ice bath is removed and the solution is stirred for 3 h at 25 \u00b0C during which time it gradually turns from yellow to dark red (Note 12). Upon completion of the reaction, solid Zn(OPiv)2 (12.3 g, 46.0 mmol, 1.15 equiv) is added in one portion under argon counterflow via a powder funnel. A slight exotherm is noticed (Note 13). The mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min leading to a clear dark red solution. The solvent is removed using a vacuum line (0.1 mmHg) and a liquid nitrogen cold trap. The solid residue is dried for at least 2 h longer leading to a voluminous yellow foam (Figure 2) (Note 14). The foam is crushed with a spatula under argon counterflow to form a fine yellow powder. This powder is dried under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) for further 2 h. The resulting pyridine-3-ylzinc pivalate (28.6-28.8 g, 1.1-1.20 mmol g-1, 31.5-34.5 mmol, 79-86%) is used immediately.\nAfter the drying process is complete, the argon-flushed flask is weighed to determine the weight of the resulting powder. To determine the actual content in zinc species and the reaction yield, a small aliquot of the powder (accurately weighed amount, ca. 1 g, see Figure 3: a) is titrated using a 1 M solution of iodine in THF (Note 15) with a color change from red (b) to bright yellow (c) until the persisting brown color of the iodine (d) indicates the completion of the titration (Note 16).\nFigure 2: Step B - The color of the reaction mixture turns from yellow to dark red.

Chloroform (10 mL) is used to rinse the additional funnel. tert-Butyl (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxycarbamate 1 (34.8 g, 141 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is dissolved in chloroform (60 mL), placed in the addition funnel, and added dropwise over 1 h. The internal temperature is maintained at 4 \u00baC throughout the course of the addition. Chloroform (10 mL) is used to wash both the flask that contained the tert-butyl (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxycarbamate and the addition funnel. The final concentration of the substrate is 0.6 M. The reaction is stirred for 12 h under nitrogen at 23 \u00b0C, and the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 11). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 325-30 mmHg). The residue is dried on the vacuum pump (0.5 mmHg) for 5 h, after which the crude compound is purified by column chromatography (Note 12). The desired fractions are collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 325-30 mmHg) to provide 13.3 g (30.1%) of the desired product. Impure fractions from the initial column are combined and further purified by column chromatography (Note 13). The desired fractions are collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C bath, 325-30 mmHg) to provide 3.4 g (7.7%) of the product. The residual oils are further dried for 5 h under vacuum pump (0.5 mmHg) to afford the desired compound as a pale yellow oil (combined yield of 16.7 g, 37.8%, >98.5% purity, 94% ee) (Notes 14, 15, 16, and 17)."

The aldehyde 1 (15.0 g, 39.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 94% ee) (Note 2) is dissolved in MeOH (200 mL, concentration of substrate is 0.20 M) (Note 3) in a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir-bar, a plastic stopper, a low-temperature thermometer and a rubber septum through which a positive nitrogen atmosphere is ensured (Note 3) (Figure 1) . The reaction mixture is cooled to -20 \u00baC using an CH3CN-dry ice bath. Sodium borohydride (3.02 g, 79.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added in ten portions (~300 mg every three min) via the neck with the plastic stopper, and the internal temperature is maintained at -20 \u00baC.\nFigure 1. Glassware assembly for the reduction step (picture obtained from submitters)\nAfter complete addition, the reaction is stirred for 45 min in the CH3CN-dry ice bath at -20 \u00baC, after which the reaction is allowed to warm up to 0 \u00baC. The reaction is monitored by TLC in 25% EtOAc in hexanes using ninhydrin to stain (Note 4). After stirring for 35 min at 0 \u00baC, TLC analysis shows disappearance of starting material. To the completed reaction, a mixture of ice-water (170 mL) is added to the solution with vigorous stirring and the solution is stirred for 10 min at 0 \u00baC (Note 5). To this mixture EtOAc (900 mL) and H2O (50 mL) are added and the resultant mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel. Ethyl acetate (50 mL) and H2O (50 mL) are used to rinse the flask. The aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (100 mL) and saturated aqueous NaCl (100 mL). The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 (20 g) and filtered by suction using a fritted funnel (9 cm diameter, medium porosity). Additional EtOAc (50 mL) is used to wash the Na2SO4 and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation into a 2-L round-bottomed flask (40 \u00b0C bath, 140-30 mmHg). The resulting pale yellow oil, containing ethyl N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-L-homoserinate (i.e., 2) is transferred to a 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask using CH2Cl2, which is then evaporated (40 \u00b0C bath, 440-30 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator. The flask is equipped with a 4-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir-bar, and the viscous oil stirred while being dried on the vacuum pump (0.15 mmHg, 24 \u00b0C) for 5 h to obtain a pale yellow oil 2 (14.7 g). The material is used without further purification (Notes 6 and 7).\nThe oil 2 (14.7 g, 38.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is diluted with CH2Cl2 (175 mL) and transferred, using a long-stemmed plastic funnel, into a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir-bar, a 125-mL addition funnel, a thermometer fitted with a glass adaptor, and a rubber septum through which an active nitrogen atmosphere is ensured (Figure 2).

THF (15 mL) is used to rinse the flask and the remaining solution transferred into the reaction flask using a 10-mL pipette. The flask is cooled down to 4 \u00baC using an ice-water bath (Figure 3). The addition funnel is charged with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1 M in THF, 58.0 mL, 58.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv, via a 100-mL graduated cylinder), which is then added to the reaction flask dropwise over 90 min, maintaining the internal temperature to 3-4 \u00baC. Tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) is used to ensure that no reagents are left on the side of the addition funnel (final concentration of substrate 0.05 M). The addition funnel and the thermometer are removed and the flask is equipped with a glass stopper and a rubber septum.\nFigure 3.

A 500-mL, three-neck, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum with a thermometer inserted through it, and a stopper, leaving the central neck open (Figure 1). To the flask are added dimethylformamide (DMF) (250 mL) (Note 2), p-toluidine (30.3 g, 280 mmol, 1 equiv), sulfur (18.0 g, 560 mmol, 2 equiv) and triethylamine (NEt3) (120 mL, 861 mmol, 3 equiv) (Note 3), and the contents of the flask are stirred at 700 rpm at 23 \u00b0C. Approximately 1 g portions of 2-chloroacetamide (31.5 g, 340 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 4) are added every two minutes over the course of an hour (Note 5) (Figure 2). The temperature of the reaction slowly increases upon addition of 2-chloroacetamide, and after approximately 16 min the internal temperature reaches 25 \u00b0C. The flask is then cooled using a 10 \u00b0C water bath, and the internal temperature of the reaction is maintained between 16-19 \u00b0C by occasional addition of ice to the water bath. Halfway through the addition, the stirring rate is increased to 850 rpm to account for the increasing viscosity of the reaction mixture. After complete addition, the vessel is protected against moisture with a drying tube filled with calcium chloride and is left to stir at 23 \u00baC for an additional 12 h (Note 6).\nFigure 1. Reaction setup for step A\nAfter that time, the reaction mixture is poured into 2.5 L deionized water acidified with 30 mL of concentrated HCl. The resulting precipitate is vacuum filtered using a medium-porosity 15 cm diameter glass frit. The crude material (3) is dissolved in 2.8 M NaOH in deionized water (150 mL) and then vacuum filtered using a 6 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel lined with filter paper (grade 413) to obtain a yellow solution of the thioamide (3).

The solution is then added dropwise to the stirring solution of potassium ferricyanide (500 rpm) over 1 h (Note 12). The addition should be performed under a good working fume hood (Note 13). After a small amount of compound (3) is added the product (4) begins to precipitate. Over the course of the addition the reaction changes color from orange to green to yellow (Figure 4).

Over the course of 12-14 min phosphorous (V) oxychloride (4.8 mL, 51 mmol, 1.65 equiv) (Note 18) is added dropwise via syringe, while maintaining an internal temperature no greater than 5 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete, the mixture is removed from the cooling bath and allowed to warm to 23 \u00baC (Figure 6). During this period the starting material reacts leading to a clear yellow solution from which TLC samples are taken to monitor reaction progress (Note 19). After about 1 h the reaction is complete as judged by disappearance of starting material by TLC. The reaction is poured into deionized water (500 mL). The resulting white precipitate is filtered through a 4.5 cm diameter medium porosity fritted filter and washed with deionized water until the filtrate is neutral (500-750 mL). The product is dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h at 0.15 mmHg over calcium chloride.

            "Within the last two decades, the development of efficient alkyne metathesis catalytic systems has allowed for the application of this methodology in both organic synthesis and materials chemistry.2,3,4,5,6 The utility of alkyne metathesis dynamic covalent chemistry (DCVC) for the preparation of complex molecular architectures has resulted in the use of this method for the synthesis of discrete, shape persistent molecular structures.3\nThe inherent reversibility of alkyne metathesis means that undesired byproducts must be continually removed in order to drive the reaction forward to a desired product.4,5 Classically, this may be achieved through the use of propynylated substrates that produce 2-butyne as a reaction byproduct (Figure 1A).5,7 This volatile product may then be removed via continually subjecting the reaction mixture to high vacuum.5,7 While this method can efficiently facilitate conversion to the desired product, the use of vacuum-driven metathesis conditions can lead to a number of drawbacks.4 In order to minimize solvent loss, high-boiling solvents such as toluene or chlorobenzenes are often used, or solvent must be periodically added.4 The efficiency of this method also decreases dramatically as the scale of the reaction is increased, greatly limiting the utility of vacuum-driven metathesis on large scale.7\nFigure 1. Comparison of vacuum and precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis\nIn order to address these limitations, we developed a precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis system (Figure 1B).7,8 This strategy relies on the incorporation of a precipitating group (PPG) into the desired reaction precursor (Figure 1B).7,8 Upon metathesis, the resulting diaryl acetylene byproduct precipitates from the reaction mixture thus driving the reaction equilibrium toward product formation.7 The advantage of this method is that it is highly effective for the large-scale synthesis of a variety of macrocycles (i.e. 1) via alkyne-metathesis that would afford low yields under classical vacuum-driven methods.7,8\nIn the years since we reported this method, the precipitating group strategy has been employed in both our own work and that of others.3 In addition to our original report where we prepared a variety of phenylene ethynylene macrocycles, we have also reported the synthesis of cyclic trimer 2 via precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis (Figure 2).7,8,9\nUpon mixing macrocycles 2 and 3 under metathesis conditions, tetrameric macrocycle 4 could be identified by mass spectrum analysis, demonstrating that arylene ethynylene macrocycles are dynamic under these conditions.9 Our own group and others have further demonstrated the utility of precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis in the development of a variety of robust alkyne metathesis catalysts.6,10,11,12,13,14 In order to simplify purification and catalyst lifetimes we have demonstrated that both solid silica-supported and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) ligands are highly active and selective catalysts for a variety of substrates, including those which rely on the use of the precipitation strategy.13,14 Zhang and coworkers have also pioneered the use of multidentate triphenol ligands that also show high catalytic activity and functional group tolerance and can be extended to the use of our precipitation driven method in high yields and short reaction times.10,11,12,15\nFigure 2. Dynamic trimeric and hexameric macrocycles Via precipitation-driven metathesis\nThe utility of precipitation-driven alkyne metathesis is particularly noteworthy for the synthesis of complex molecular cages.16,17,18,19,20 Zhang and coworkers have made use of this methodology for the preparation of a number of molecular cages (Figure 3). Cage 5 was prepared in 56% yield via precipitation driven metathesis from a rigid porphyrin precursor.17 Notably, this shape-persistent molecular prism shows high binding affinity for both C60 and C70 fullerenes, with the binding constant for encapsulation of C70 being three orders of magnitude greater than that for C60.\nFollowing this report, Zhang and coworkers prepared bisporphyrin macrocycle 6 in 60% yield through precipitation alkyne metathesis.19 Fullerene binding studies demonstrated that this macrocycle shows the highest affinity for C84. These results demonstrate the ability to prepare a number of structures with variable properties that can be accessed through efficient precipitation-driven metathesis.19 In addition to facilitating efficient metathesis, the use of the precipitating group moiety can improve the purification of complex substrates.16,20 Zhang and coworkers have demonstrated this in the synthesis of both carbazole20 and porphyrin16-based precursors. In both examples, the inclusion of the precipitating group was found to improve purification owing to its increased polarity over other alkyne substitutions. These results demonstrate the additional utility of this strategy as a handle for improved purification of metathesis precursors.\nFigure 3. Molecular cages prepared by Zhang and coworkers using precipitation-driven metathesis\nWhile precipitation driven alkyne metathesis is broadly applicable and has been widely used for many different substrates, this method requires additional synthetic overhead to include the precipitating moiety.4,7 Additionally, the high molecular weight of the precipitating group results in poor atom economy for the overall reaction.4 Methyl-capped alkynes produce volatile 2-butyne as a side product, which has classically been removed via vacuum to drive the reaction.7 In 2010, F\u00fcrstner and coworkers reported that 5\u00c5 molecular sieves efficiently sequester 2-butyne with comparable yields as precipitation and vacuum-driven procedures.21\nMolecular sieves have successfully been used to drive alkyne metathesis on a variety of different substrates, and can be used for large-scale synthesis in comparable yields to precipitation-based methods as demonstrated in the synthesis of carbazole macrocycle 7 (Figure 4).8,21 We have also demonstrated that carbazole macrocycle 7 may be prepared via a depolymerization/macrocyclization route from polymeric carbazole precursors.22\nFigure 4. Comparison of molecular sieves and vacuum/precipitation driven methods\nThe use of molecular sieves in alkyne metathesis is an effective and general method that has been widely applied in both natural product and materials synthesis.3,4 In recent years we have heavily relied on this method for the synthesis of a number of complex molecular architectures (Figure 5).23,24,25,26 In 2016 we reported the preparation of kinetically trapped tetrahedral cages (8) via alkyne metathesis from methyl-capped tritopic precursors using molecular sieves to sequester 2-butyne.25 This reaction proceeds through initial formation of oligomeric intermediates that 'self-correct' to the tetrahedral cage product. The use of propynylated substrates is particularly advantageous in terms of solubility for both precursors and reaction products, especially for reactions that proceed through initial formation of oligomeric intermediates along the pathway to a discrete product. We have also demonstrated the cyclooligomerization of bifunctional precursors to prepare cycloparaphenyleneacetylene precursors (9). Both of these processes proceed in near quantitative yields through the use of molecular sieves and can be performed on gram scales with similar efficiency.26 Commercial grade 5\u00c5 powdered molecular sieves are used for these reactions, and must be thoroughly dried in a vacuum oven prior to use. We typically employ a ratio of 800 mg to 1 g of molecular sieves per millimole of propynyl groups, and recommend stirring the mixture vigorously to ensure distribution of powdered sieves.25,26\nFigure 5. Tetrahedral cages and cyclooligomers prepared via alkyne metathesis using molecular sieves\nThe use of a precipitating group or a molecular sieves approach largely depends on both the synthetic overhead and structural characteristics of the system in question. The use of a precipitating-group strategy can be advantageous in terms of both scalability and purification of complex reaction precursors.8,16 The use of this moiety also results in poor atom economy and can complicate solubility of reaction precursors. The use of methyl-capped precursors in conjunction with molecular sieves is an attractive and scalable method with high efficiency.4,25 Installation of propyne groups is synthetically simple and significantly more atom economical. Overall, while both precipitation and molecular sieve strategies are viable methods that furnish very comparable yields and scalability across a wide range of precursors, the efficiency and synthetic ease of using a molecular-sieves driven approach make this method the most general for driving alkyne metathesis reactions.4,7"

            "Conjugate arylation of alkynes activated by an electron-withdrawing group is a practical method to prepare substituted alkenes. Conventionally, arylcopper reagents have been employed for this purpose,2 and the copper-catalyzed conjugate arylation using stoichiometric amounts of arylmagenesium halides has also been developed.3 The E/Z stereoselectivity of the arylation products strongly depends on the structures of the alkyne substrates and arylmetal reagents as well as the reaction conditions. Moreover, nucleophilic arylmetal reagents used in the conventional methods have limited functional group compatibility. In striking contrast, the transition metal-catalyzed hydroarylations of alkynes with a broad substrate scope have recently been developed using bench-top stable arylboron reagents.4 In particular, hydroarylation of activated alkynes generally afford products in which the aryl group is introduced at the carbon \u03b2 to the electron-withdrawing group.\nAlthough transition metal-catalyzed hydroarylations of alkynes are very useful, they require expensive rhodium or palladium catalysts, as well as additional ligands and/or additives. A few examples of catalysts based on inexpensive first-row transition metals, such as nickel and cobalt, have been reported, but they have seen limited development as compared to rhodium and palladium catalysts.5 We have independently developed a hydroarylation of internal alkynoates with arylboronic acids using inexpensive copper catalysts, such as CuOAc or Cu(OAc)2, in methanol at ambient temperature, which selectively afforded syn-hydroarylation products.6 Furthermore, neither ligands nor additives are required in this reaction. Thus, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynoates provides easy access to synthetically valuable \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted acrylates.\nWith the abovementioned features, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of internal alkynoates has been applied to the synthesis of various heterocyclic motifs, which are found in natural products and pharmaceutically important compounds. For example, 4-arylbutenolides, 4-arylpentenolides, and 4-arylcoumarins have been synthesized from alkynoates having an alcohol or phenol moiety on the alkyne terminalvia tandem Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation/lactonization processes.7,8 Representative examples are shown in Scheme 1. Notably, hydroarylation/coumarin formation enabled the efficient synthesis of seven natural neoflavones.\nScheme 1. Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation/lactonization\nNitrogen heterocycles have also been synthesized by Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation, as shown in Scheme 2.9,10,11 The hydroarylation product derived from (o-nitrophenyl)alkynoate 1 was converted into 3-phenyl-indole-2-carboxylate 2 in high yield via Mo-catalyzed Cadogan cyclization.9,12 Hydroarylation of the orthogonally protected (o-amino-phenyl)alkynoate 3 could be performed under similar conditions to afford an N-benzyl-4-aryl-2-quinolone after acidic removal of the Boc group.10 Because of the bulky protected o-aminophenyl moiety, protodeboration of the arylboronic acid proceeded faster than the desired hydroarylation. Thus, arylboronic acid 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol esters, such as 4, should be used to suppress the undesired protodeboration. The use of a sterically more demanding pinacol ester retarded the reaction, thus diminishing the product yield. This tandem hydroarylation/lactamization process could be successfully applied to the synthesis of a natural alkaloid and relevant derivatives.11\nScheme 2. N-Heterocycles synthesis via Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation\nBesides alkynoates, other electron-deficient alkynes have also been used as substrates for Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation. The hydroarylation of 3-aryl-2-propynenitriles stereoselectively affords 3,3-diarylacrylonitriles,13 and this method has been successfully extended to the synthesis of antitumor agent CC-5079 (Scheme 3).14 Since the biological activity of CC-5079 strongly depends on its olefin geometry,15 Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation is quite useful as it affords both stereoisomers in a stereospecific manner. Trifluoromethyl groups also function as electron-withdrawing groups, as Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation efficiently proceeds with (trifluoromethyl)-alkynes, affording valuable tri-substituted (trifluoromethyl)alkenes.16 Thus, the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of (trifluoromethyl)alkyne 4 with (o-nitro)phenylboronic acid stereoselectively furnished trisubstituted alkene 5, which was further transformed into 3-aryl-2-(trifluoromethyl)indole 6 in high yield via the modified Cadogan cyclization (Scheme 4).17\nScheme 3. Synthesis of CC-5079\nScheme 4. Synthesis of 3-aryl-2-(trifluoromethyl)indole\nEnantioselective conjugate reduction of \u03b2,\u03b2-diaryl-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds provides efficient access to chiral 1,1-diarylalkyl motifs, which are frequently found in bioactive molecules. Therefore, stereoselective construction of the required unsaturated carbonyl precursors is crucial, and Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation has been used for this purpose.18 As a demonstration of this strategy, Yun and co-workers reported the enantioselective synthesis of (R)-tolterodine,19 a potent muscarinic antagonist, via Cu-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate reduction of a 3,3-diarylacrylonitrile (Scheme 5).20 The required acrylonitrile precursor 8 was obtained in 71% yield via Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of cyanoalkyne 7 bearing an unprotected phenol moiety with phenylboronic acid. Subsequent asymmetric conjugate reduction of 8 with polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as the reducing agent was performed in the presence of 2 mol % Cu(OAc)2 and 2 mol % chiral ligand 9 ((R)-(S)-Josiphos) in toluene at room temperature, affording the desired saturated 3,3-diarylpropanenitrile 10 in 86% yield and with 96% ee. Finally, 10 was transformed to (R)-tolterodine in 63% yield over two steps.\nScheme 5. Enantioselective synthesis of (R)-tolterodine\nWhen allylboronate was used instead of arylboron reagents under the Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation conditions, hydroallylation products were obtained with high regio- and stereoselectivities. Notably, this mild Cu-catalyzed protocol selectively produced 1,4-dienes in good yields, although such a skipped diene tends to undergo isomerization to a more stable 1,3-diene (conjugate diene). Hydroallylation proceeded with alkynylamide 11b and alkynylsulfone 11c, in addition to alkynoates and cyanoalkynes (Scheme 6).21 The introduced allyl moiety could be employed as a synthetic handle for subsequent transformations, such as hydroboration/oxidation or hydroboration/Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. The interesting bicyclic butenolide 15 was also synthesized from 1,6-enynoate 13 via sequential hydroallylation/ring-closing metathesis.22 Furthermore, Kong, Zhu, and co-workers reported the hydroallylation of thioalkynes, such as 16.23 In this case, modified conditions with a mixed solvent (MeOH/THF, 1:3) improved the product yield. The obtained product 17 could be used for nickel-catalyzed cross coupling with Grignard reagents via C-S bond cleavage.\nScheme 6. Cu-catalyzed hydroallylation of internal alkynes\nA disadvantage of Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation and hydroallylation is that they are restricted to the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. Hence, an alternative method to synthesize tetrasubstituted alkenes was developed by Sawamura, Ohmiya, and co-workers: the three-component coupling of an alkynoate, alkyl-9-BBN 18, and nBu3 SnOMe proceeded in the presence of catalytic amounts of CuOAc andtBuOK in dioxane at 60 \u00b0C, affording alkenylstannane 19 in 74% yield with a syn/anti ratio of 97:3 (Scheme 7).24 The obtained product could be utilized as a substrate for various cross-coupling reactions. When adding tBuOH instead of nBu3SnOMe as the proton source, hydroalkylation product 20 was also obtained quantitatively.25 In this case, the use of P(OPh)3 as the ligand was necessary to achieve a complete syn selectivity.\nScheme 7. Cu-catalyzed stannylalkylation and hydroalkylation\nIn summary, Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation of electron-deficient alkynes with arylboron reagents has been developed as an efficient protocol for the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of valuable trisubstituted alkenes with a functional group under mild conditions. This method is also intriguing because inexpensive copper acetates act as catalysts, and neither ligands nor additives are required. The broad substrate scope of this Cu-catalyzed hydroarylation has been exploited for the synthesis of important heterocyclic compounds, including butenolides, pentenolides, coumarins, indoles, and 2-quinolones. Moreover, the protocol was extended to hydroallylation and hydroalkylation/stannylalkylation using allylboronates or alkylborons, respectively, instead of arylboron reagents. In the future, these methods are expected to find broad application in the synthesis of natural products, functional materials, and bioactive molecules.\nReferences\nDepartment of Basic Medicinal Sciences, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.

Then, water (38 mL) is added in one portion and the reaction mixture becomes a clear red solution (Figure 2B). Upon subsequent addition of triethylamine (17.5 mL, 125 mmol, 1.00 equiv), a slight increase in internal temperature is observed (\u0394~6 \u00b0C) and the mixture becomes darker (Figure 2C).\nFigure 2.

The dark red mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Notes 6 and 7). The crude material is diluted with diethyl ether (200 mL), transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel (Figure 3a and 3b) and washed with water twice (200 mL and 100 mL, respectively) (Note 8). The combined aqueous layer is back extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 100 mL) until no product was observed in the organic layer (as judged by TLC) (Note 4) and the combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (7 g), filtered, and concentrated to give a dark red/brown oil (Figure 3c) (35.3 g) (Note 9).\n\nFigure 3.

The solution is then extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 100 mL) until no product was observed in the organic layer (as judged by TLC) (Note 16). The organics are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in the rotavapor to give an off-white solid (29.95 g. 99%) (Note 18) (Figure 6).\n(b) Crystallization.

The hot solution is transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask. Additional warm heptane (200 mL) is used to rinse the residual product into the 1-L flask. The mixture is allowed to cool slowly to 20 \u00b0C over the course of 4-5 h. As the temperature reaches 25-30 \u00b0C, as determined by an inserted thermometer, crystals begin to form on the side of the flask (Note 20) (Figure 7). The liquid phase is decanted, concentrated to dryness, and placed under reduced pressure (0.25 mmHg) for 2 h to give (3S)-3-(4-bromophenyl)butanoic acid (2) as an off-white solid (21.93 g, 90.6 mmol) in a 73% yield (Notes 21 and 22).\nFigure 6.

Color change through the course of the copper complex formation\nA solution of the imine prepared earlier (ca. 8.9 g) (Notes 20 and 21) in dichloromethane (10 mL) (Note 24) is added dropwise via syringe over 5 min affording a brown reaction mixture. The flask that contained the imine is rinsed with dichloromethane (2 x 2.5 mL) (Note 24) that are added to the reaction mixture via syringe in one portion.\nThe resulting brown reaction mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h affording a green suspension that is quenched with a pre-mixed solution of 1:1 water-NH4OH solution (150 mL) (Note 29), which is added via a graduated cylinder in one portion (Notes 30 and 31). The biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously (ca. 800 rpm) for 30 min before being poured into a 1-L separatory funnel. The blue aqueous layer is separated and extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 25 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with a pre-mixed solution of 1:1 water-NH4OH solution (2 x 40 mL) (Note 29) and saturated NaCl solution (2 x 40 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (15 g), and filtered through a 150-mL sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (medium porosity, 66 mm diameter). The MgSO4 is washed with dichloromethane (3 x 15 mL) and the combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The resulting brown oil is further concentrated at 40 \u00b0C and ca. 0.1 mmHg to remove most of the 2,6-lutidine (prior to chromatographic purification) affording ca. 13.0 g of brown oil (Note 32). This material is diluted with dichloromethane (5 mL) and deposited onto a column (90 mm diameter) of 340 g of silica gel (10 cm high) (Note 10) prepared as a slurry in 12:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate. Elution is carried out with 12:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate (2 L) and then 9:1 dichloromethane-ethyl acetate, collecting 50-mL fractions. The desired product is obtained in fractions 28-65 (Note 33). These fractions are combined, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). Further concentration at 25 \u00b0C under 0.1 mmHg for 2 h provides 2.55 g (65%) of morpholine 2 as a yellow oil (Figure 3) (Notes 9, 15, 34 and 35).\nFigure 3. Product of Step B"

[13C]Methyl-p-toluenesulfonate: (1).2 A 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval) is charged with sodium hydroxide (30.3 g, 758 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 2). The flask is placed in an ice bath and water (50 mL) (Note 3) is added in one portion with stirring. [13C]Methanol (5.00 g, 151.5 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 4) is weighed in a 12 mL syringe and slowly added to the hydroxide solution at 0 \u00b0C. p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl) (34.7 g, 182 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 5) is weighed into a 250 mL single-necked conical flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (30 mm x 15 mm, oval). Tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 6) is added to this flask and stirred under nitrogen until all the TsCl dissolves. This solution is added over five min via cannulation under nitrogen to the NaOH reaction flask, which is cooled in an ice bath. The conical flask is rinsed with THF (5 mL), which is then added to the round-bottomed flask. The internal sides of the RBF are then rinsed with additional THF (5 mL) via syringe before sealing with a rubber septum and venting with a small needle (Figure 1A). The ice-bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to 25 \u00b0C with stirring over 20 h (Note 7). The reaction is neutralized by the slow addition of acetic acid (33 mL, 576 mmol, 3.8 equiv) (Note 8) at 0 \u00b0C over 5 min. The reaction mixture is left unstirred for 20 min at 0 \u00b0C to induce crystallization of sodium acetate (Note 9). The reaction mixture is then filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) to remove solid sodium acetate and the filtrate layers of THF and water are separated in a 250 mL separating funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 60 mL) (Note 10). The filter cake is dissolved in water (150 mL) along with residue in the reaction flask and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 60 mL). The organic phases are combined, transferred to a 500 mL separating funnel, washed with sat. aq. Na2CO3 (100 mL) (Note 11) and sat. aq. NaCl (100 mL) (Note 12), dried over Na2SO4 (~40 g) for 10 min (Note 13), and filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The sodium sulfate is placed on the same sintered glass funnel and rinsed using additional ethyl acetate (40 mL). The organic solvent is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (150 to 7 mmHg). A clear, colorless oil is obtained and transferred to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask with diethyl ether rinsings (~50 mL) (Note 14) and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (600 to 7 mmHg). Additional diethyl ether (~50 mL) is added and the concentration repeated to give 27.1 g (96%) of a slightly yellow oil (Figure 1B) (Notes 15 and 16).\nFigure 1.

A dry 500 mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval), a nitrogen inlet and a rubber septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained this way over the course of the reaction. The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (175 mL) (Note 17) and cooled to -78 \u00b0C (Note 18). n-Butyllithium (68 mL, 2.45 M in hexanes, 167 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Notes 19 and 20) is added to the cooled THF with efficient stirring (Note 21). Benzophenone imine (29 mL, 174 mmol, 1.15 equiv) is dissolved in THF (40 mL), and the solution is added via cannulation over a period 10 min to give a blue solution (Note 22). The benzophenone imine flask is rinsed with THF (10 mL) and added to the reaction flask (Figure 2A). [13C]Methyl p-toluenesulfonate (1) is dissolved in THF (40 mL) and added via cannulation using a double-ended needle over 10 min to the cold (-78 \u00b0C) solution. The methyl p-toluenesulfonate flask is rinsed with THF (10 mL), which is added to the reaction flask. The stir-rate is increased to facilitate a mild vortex (Note 23) and the flask is transferred to a large ice-bath and allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C over 20 min (Note 24). The flask is placed in a large water bath at 23 \u00b0C for a further 45 min. The reaction is quenched with water (5 mL), transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel and partitioned with water (200 mL) and Et2O (200 mL) (Note 25). The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is back extracted with Et2O (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with sat. aq. Na2CO3 (100 mL), sat. aq. NaCl (100 mL), dried with Na2SO4 (~40 g) for 10 min, and filtered through a sintered glass funnel (100 mm tall, 50 mm wide) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The sodium sulfate is washed in the same sintered glass funnel using additional Et2O (40 mL). The bright yellow solution is concentrated in vacuo (600 to 7 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) to give a yellow oil (35 g). The oil is treated with petroleum ether (250 mL, bp 35-60 \u00b0C) (Note 26) to give a cloudy solution, which is placed in a fridge (4 \u00b0C) for 20 h. A short pad of CeliteTM 545 (3 cm deep) (Note 27), which is first wetted with 50 mL of petroleum ether, is prepared in a 60 mL glass funnel (medium frit). The mixture is then filtered through the CeliteTM into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask using petroleum ether (150 mL). The solution is concentrated in vacuo (40 \u00b0C, 500 to 120 to 7 mmHg) to give a yellow oil (32 g) (Figure 2B) (Note 28).

A dry 1 L, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval), a nitrogen inlet and two rubber septa is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained this way over the course of the reaction (Figure 3A). The flask is charged with anhydrous THF (240 mL) and d iisopropylamine (30.3 mL, 216 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 30) before being cooled to -78 \u00b0C (Note 31). n-Butyllithium (88.1 mL, 2.45 M in hexanes, 216 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added with stirring to the diisopropylamine solution. After 5 min stirring at -78 \u00b0C, chlorotrimethylsilane (29.2 mL, 230 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 32) is added over 3 min followed immediately by N-[13C]methyl benzophenone imine (2) that is dissolved in THF (40 mL), which is added over the course of 5 min. The flask that contained compound 2 is rinsed with THF (10 mL), which is added to the three-necked flask. A dark solution is formed, which can be dark green to dark red depending on slight changes in the amount of unreacted benzophenone imine. Figure 3B shows the dark green color of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at -78 \u00b0C for 15 mins, at which time the dry ice/acetone bath is removed and a dry ice/CHCl3 bath (-60 \u00b0C) is added (Note 33). The reaction is maintained at this temperature for 5 h. The reaction is quenched at -60 \u00b0C by the slow addition of acetone (6.3 mL, 86 mmol, 0.6 equiv) (Note 34) and the resulting quenched solution left to stir for 10 min at this temperature (Note 35). The reaction mixture is transferred to a large 23 \u00b0C water bath and allowed to warm over 15 min to give a yellow-orange solution (Figure 3C). The solution is transferred to a 1 L single-necked, round-bottomed flask, and the three-necked flask is rinsed with petroleum ether (50 mL), which is added to the single-necked, round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (500 to 120 to 7 mmHg). The residue is suspended in petroleum ether (150 mL), filtered through a 3 cm plug of CeliteTM 545 filter aid (Note 36) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask with petroleum ether (70 mL) and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (500 to 120 to 7 mmHg).\nThe residue is once more dissolved in petroleum ether (150 mL), cooled in an ice-water bath for ~20 min, filtered through a ~3 cm pad of CeliteTM 545 with additional petroleum ether (70 mL) into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 3 mmHg) to give the crude product (~44 g) as a clear yellow to orange oil (Figure 3D) (Notes 37 and 38).

A solution of N-[13C]methyl(trimethylsilyl)-benzophenone imine (44 g crude) in MTBE (350 mL) (Note 41) is placed in a hydrogenation apparatus containing 10 g of Pd/C (10%) (Note 42) (Figure 4A). The mixture is stirred under 20 psi of hydrogen for 24 h (Note 43), at which time LCMS show all the starting material is consumed (Note 44).\nThe mixture is filtered through a short pad of CeliteTM 545 and rinsed with MTBE (100 mL). The colorless filtrate solution is stirred for 15 min while bubbling nitrogen slowly into the solution. A solution of 2M HCl in ether (Note 45) is added slowly over 45 min to give a fluffy white solid, and stirring is continued for 2 h (Note 46). The mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel (Note 47) to collect the solid trimethylsilylmethylamine hydrochloride salt. After drying under suction for 1 h, the vacuum is removed and the solid is broken up using a spatula. MTBE (50 mL) is added to the solid and stirred using the spatula for 2 min. Vacuum is applied again to remove the solvent and isolate a fluffy white solid (15.5 g) (Note 48). This product is transferred to a 250 mL round bottomed flask and suspended in isopropanol (100 mL) (Note 49). The suspension is heated in an oil bath to 85 \u00b0C to give a slight yellow solution. The temperature of the oil bath is reduced to 40 \u00b0C and MTBE (300 mL) is added slowly via a funnel. The product begins to precipitate before all MTBE is added. The resulting suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature over 30 min and then placed in the freezer at -20 \u00b0C and left overnight.\nFiltration through a sintered funnel and rinsing with MTBE (50 mL) gives shiny white fluffy crystals, which are dried under suction using an inverted funnel dispensing nitrogen (Figure 4B) for 2 h to give white crystals (10.56 g, 52%) (Notes 50 and 51) (Figure 4C), which are stored in a screw cap flask.\nFigure 4.

Diethyl ether (30 mL) (Note 14) is added, followed by a freshly prepared solution of 2M aq NaOH (40 mL) (Note 2). The biphasic solution is swirled until all solids are dissolved, and the colorless solution is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. The Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed with additional 2M NaOH solution (30 mL) and ether (10 mL), both of which are added to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is saturated with NaCl (15.4 g, 0.22 g per mL of 2N NaOH solution). The organic layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 x 25 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over Na2SO4 (5 g) for 10 min, then filtered through a sintered funnel to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask. The Na2SO4 is rinsed with ether (10 mL). The colorless solution is stirred using a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar (35 mm x 15 mm, oval). The flask is placed in an oil bath and fitted with a Vigreux column, short condenser and collection flask (Note 53) (Figure 6A and 6B).

The flask is charged with methyl 1-cyclopentene-1-carboxylate (1) (Note 2) (7.0 g, 55 mmol, 1.0 equiv). Ethyl acetate (280 mL) (Note 3) is added, followed by 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves (7.0 g) (Note 4). The septum is replaced with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel that is capped with a septum. A tert-butylhydroperoxide solution in decane (5.5 M) (41 mL, 221 mmol, 4.0 equiv) is added via the addition funnel over 15 min (Figure 1) (Note 5). The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min.\nFigure 1. Addition of t-BuOOH\nManganese(III) acetate dihydrate (1.487 g, 5.5 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Figure 2) (Note 6) is transferred to a vial in a glove bag under a nitrogen atmosphere and the solid is added quickly to the reaction mixture. The argon balloon is removed and the reaction flask is flushed with oxygen using a balloon for 10 min (Figure 3).\nFigure 2. Glove bag\nThe reaction mixture is stirred under an oxygen atmosphere at 23 \u00b0C for 48 h using a balloon filled with oxygen (Figure 4) (Note 7). The reaction is monitored by TLC on silica using 30% EtOAc-hexane as the eluent (Note 8). After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is filtered through a Celite pad (Note 9) that is then washed with diethyl ether (40 mL). The filtrate is diluted with water (150 mL) and transferred to 1 L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and the organic layer is washed again with water (150 mL). The organic extract is tested for peroxides with KI starch paper and no color is observed (Note 10). The organic extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for 10 min and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg).

The middle neck is fitted with a pressure equalizing addition funnel (150 mL) equipped with a rubber septum and an argon balloon. One side neck is equipped with a septum pierced by a thermometer and the remaining neck is sealed with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with methyl 3-oxocyclopent-1-enecarboxylate (2) (3.0 g, 21.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv), followed by the addition of dichloromethane (214 mL, 0.1 M) by syringe. The reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath with stirring for 10 min (Note 15). A solution of bromine (1.62 mL, 32.1 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 16) in dichloromethane (40 mL) is charged into the addition funnel and is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 30 min. The addition funnel is rinsed with dichloromethane (4 mL). The initially colorless solution turned red over the course of this addition (Figure 5A). After complete addition of the bromine solution, the reaction mixture is warmed to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 1 h (Figure 5B). The reaction mixture is again cooled in an ice bath and a solution of triethylamine (5.98 mL, 42.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 17) in dichloromethane (40 mL) (Note 18) is carefully added dropwise through the addition funnel to the reaction mixture over 30 min (Note 19). The red-colored solution turns yellow during the addition of triethylamine (Figure 6A) (Note 20). After complete addition, the reaction mixture is again warmed to 23 \u00b0C and stirred for 8 h, during which time the yellow color turns red (Figure 6B). The reaction is monitored by TLC on silica using 30% EtOAc-hexane as the eluent (Note 21).

            "Phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands, originally developed by Pfaltz, Helmchen, and Williams,2,3,4 comprise a privileged class of P,N type ligands with extensive applications in various transition-metal catalyzed processes, including allylic alkylations, Heck-type reactions, and catalytic hydrogenation.5,6 The PHOX ligand class is highly modular and has grown to encompass numerous structural variations, of which only a few major classes are shown in Figure 1. Every component of the ligand scaffold is modifiable as exemplified by R1 variations on the oxazoline ring (1, 2), substitution of the aryl rings with perfluoroalkyl groups (2) or ferrocenyl systems (3), and various alkyl and spirocyclic7 linkers joining the oxazoline ring to the phosphine backbone (4a-b).6\nFigure 1. Phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands are highly modular\nThe substituted tri-aryl PHOX ligands 1 are of particular interest to our laboratory. Since our 2009 Organic Syntheses articles, which described an optimized route to the valuable PHOX ligand (S)-t-BuPHOX 1a and its use in a Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative allylic alkylation reaction toward the synthesis of (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone,8,9 electronic and steric modifications to the scaffold of 1a have found increasing traction in the literature.10,11,12 In particular, electron-deficient counterparts such as (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5), (S)-(CF3)4-t-BuPHOX (6), and (S)-(CF3)4(F)-t-BuPHOX (7), which contain trifluoromethyl groups at strategic positions on the aryl rings, have been uniquely effective and in many cases superior to 1a in various highly enantioselective metal-catalyzed reactions.13,14 These ligands may be synthesized through modified procedures based on our original Organic Syntheses article.8,10,13 This Discussion Addendum highlights recent applications of 1a and its electron-deficient variants 5-7 in total synthesis and reaction development, with an emphasis on decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions.\nFigure 2. Electron-deficient variants of (S)-t-BuPHOX\nPHOX Ligands in Reaction Development\nAside from their common use in various asymmetric allylic allylation-type reactions,15,16,17 PHOX ligands 1a and 5-7 have recently been utilized in diverse transformations including sigmatropic rearrangements,18 hydroarylation reactions,19 carboaminations,20 asymmetric alkylations and protonations,21,22 and cascade reactions.23 The chemical motifs produced by these PHOX-catalyzed reactions are often found in biologically active small molecules and can also serve as synthetically valuable intermediates. For instance in 2012, Kozlowski presented a rare example of a catalytic enantioselective Saucy-Marbet Claisen rearrangement using 1a to effect the transformation of propargyl ethers 8 into allenyl oxindoles 9 (Scheme 1).18 However, 1a was effective only for a subset of aryl-substituted alkyne substrates.\nScheme 1. Synthesis of quaternary allenyl indoles using an enantioselective Saucy-Marbet Claisen rearrangement\nLater in 2015, 1a was also utilized by Wolfe in a Pd-catalyzed alkene carboamination reaction involving allylphenyltriflates 10 and aliphatic amines to generate chiral aminoindanes 11, a motif that appears in a variety of pharmacologically active molecules (Scheme 2).20 Interestingly, the crucial aminopalladation step consists of an intermolecular reaction.\nScheme 2. Synthesis of aminoindanes via alkene carboamination\nIn 2017, Zhu used 1a and a stoichiometric amount of tetrahydroxy diboron-water as the hydride donor to effect an asymmetric intramolecular reductive Heck reaction of N-aryl acrylamides 12 to give 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles 13 (Scheme 3).19 Notably, the choice of ligand affected the reaction pathway: whereas PPh3 led to carboboration products, 1a gave the desired hydroarylation product 13.\nScheme 3. Synthesis of quaternary oxindoles via asymmetric intramolecular reductive Heck reaction\nRecently, in an elegant extension of our work on asymmetric alkylation of 3-halooxindoles,24 Bisai and co-workers disclosed the use of a Cu-1a catalyst to effect malonate addition onto 3-hydroxy 3-indolyl-2-oxindoles 14 (Scheme 4).21 It is thought that the copper catalyst facilitates a stereoablative elimination of water, followed by asymmetric addition of the malonate.\nScheme 4. Synthesis of quaternary dimeric oxindoles by malonate addition onto 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles\nLam discovered that a Nickel-PHOX catalyst comprised of 1a or (S)-PhPHOX effectively catalyzed the coupling of alkynyl malonate esters 16 with arylboronic esters in a desymmetrizing arylative cyclization (Scheme 5).23 The resulting cyclopentenone products 17 contain a synthetically challenging fully substituted olefin and a chiral quaternary center.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of chiral cyclopentenones via nickel-catalyzed desymmetrization of alkynyl malonate esters with arylboronic acids\nWith regard to allylic alkylation-type reactions, 1a and its electron deficient counterparts 5-7 have found extensive applications: After our initial reports on asymmetric decarboxylative protonation,25,26 the Guiry group has continued to expand the scope and understanding of this reaction. In one example in 2017, they utilized (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) to enable the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary \u03b1-arylated indanones 19 (Scheme 6).27\nScheme 6. Synthesis of chiral tertiary \u03b1-aryl indanones using decarboxylative protonation\nIn 2017, Malcolmson introduced a method to synthesize chiral allylic amines 21 through the intermolecular addition of aliphatic amines to acyclic 1,3-dienes 20 (Scheme 7).15 Here, the electron deficient PHOX ligand 6 was critical in achieving high regioselectivity for the desired 1,2-hydroamination product.\nScheme 7. Synthesis of allylic amines via diene hydroamination\nRecently, You employed a Pd-7 catalyst in a dearomative formal [3+2] cycloaddition of nitroindoles 22 and epoxybutenes 23 to synthesize chiral quaternary tetrahydrofuroindoles 24 (Scheme 8).14 Notably, the diastereoselectivity of this reaction was affected by the choice of solvent, with toluene and acetonitrile providing differing diastereomers.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of tetrahydrofuroindoles via dearomative formal [3+2] cycloaddition of nitroindoles and epoxybutenes\nAlong with the Trost laboratory and others, our group has pioneered the development of transition metal-catalyzed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions to generate quaternary stereocenter-containing compounds. Following our initial efforts on cycloalkanone systems using (S)-t-BuPHOX,28,29 we have extended the reaction to a wide range of cyclic substrates important in pharmaceuticals and natural product synthesis (Table 1).30,31,32,33,34,35 This versatile methodology now enables the synthesis of chiral disubstituted carbocycles of ring size four to eight, \"Mannich\" adducts, and heterocycles. Especially in the case of lactam systems 29-36, the electron deficient ligand 5 was hypothesized to generate a more reactive palladium catalyst and was required to achieve high levels of asymmetry.\nTable 1. Chiral \u03b1-disubstituted carbocycles and lactams accessible by decarboxylative allylic alkylation\nFurthermore, in an effort to reduce catalyst loadings to facilitate industrial scale applications, we developed a low-catalyst loading method employing Pd(OAc)2 instead of the usual zero-valent palladium source (Scheme 9).36 With this protocol, catalyst loadings as low as 0.075 mol %, corresponding with turnover numbers (TON) of up to 1320, could be used while still providing yields and ee's up to 99%.\nScheme 9. Low-palladium loading protocol for decarboxylative allylic alkylation\nMost recently in 2018, we extended the scope of decarboxylative allylic alkylation toward challenging acyclic substrates by reporting the first asymmetric decarboxylative alkylation of fully substituted acyclic enol carbonates to provide linear \u03b1-quaternary ketones 38, again employing electronic deficient PHOX ligand 5 (Scheme 10).37,38 Of particular interest, the same enantiomer of product was obtained with comparably high ee regardless of the E/Z ratio of the starting material, suggesting a possible dynamic kinetic enolate equilibration during the reaction.\nScheme 10. Synthesis of acyclic \u03b1-quaternary ketones using decarboxylative alkylation\nPHOX ligands in Natural Product Synthesis\nAs a testament to the versatility of allylic alkylation-type reactions, recent total syntheses that utilize PHOX ligands do so heavily in the context of transition-metal catalyzed allylic alkylations and protonations. For instance, in Takemoto's 2014 synthesis of the tricyclic alkaloid (-)-aurantioclavine (39), 1a was used in an intramolecular allylic amination of allyl carbonate 37 to generate an unusual seven-membered azepane 38 (Scheme 11).39\nScheme 11. Total synthesis of (-)-aurantioclavine via allylic amination\nSimilarly, in 2012 and 2014, we used a series of powerful allylic alkylations to intercept chiral gem-disubstituted cyclic intermediates 41, 44, and 47 en route to the formal syntheses of seven natural products including (-)-thujopsene (42), (-)-quinic acid (45), and (+)-rhazinilam (48) (Scheme 12).33,40\nScheme 12. Formal syntheses of diverse natural products via allylic alkylation\nDecarboxylative protonation has also found utility in natural product synthesis. In route to a 2014 catalytic enantioselective formal synthesis of the hexacyclic caged indole alkaloid (-)-aspidofractinine (51), Shao used 1a in an enantioselective decarboxylative protonation reaction to forge C3-monosubstitutions on medicinally important carbazolone heterocycles 50 (Scheme 13).41 Later in 2017, Robinson and co-workers also used 1a in a decarboxylative protonation protocol to make \u03b1-substituted ketone 53, which was then divergently advanced toward the spirocyclic marine alkaloids (-)-fasicularin (54) and (-)-lepadiformine (55).42\nScheme 13. Total syntheses of (-)-aspidofractinine, (-)-lepadiformine, and (-)-fasicularin using decarboxylative protonation\nMost of the remaining recent examples of PHOX ligands 1a and 5-7 in total synthesis have been found in the context of decarboxylative allylic alkylation toward the synthesis of indole alkaloid natural products (Scheme 14).43 For example, vinylogous ether 56, prepared from a (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a)-catalyzed allylic alkylation, can be advanced to (-)-aspidospermidine (57) in a formal total synthesis.40 Similarly, the familiar gem-disubstituted lactam 47 serves as an intermediate in the formal syntheses of (+)-quebrachamine (60) and (-)-vincadifformine (61).40 In 2014, Mukai synthesized the pentacyclic indole (+)-kopsihainanine A (59) utilizing (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) in a decarboxylative alkylation to generate lactam intermediate 58.44 Notably, (+)-kopsihainanine A was previously independently synthesized by both Shao and Lupton in 2013, who also also utilized decarboxylative alkylation to synthesize a structurally distinct carbazolone intermediate.45,46\nScheme 14. Decarboxylative allylic alkylation in the total synthesis of indole alkaloid natural products\nIn 2016, Zhu accomplished the syntheses of indole alkaloids (-)-rhazinilam (63), (-)-leucomidine B (64), and (+)-leuconodine F (65) via a divergent route from quaternary cyclopentanone 62, which was synthesized via allylic alkylation using ligand 1a.47 Ligand 5 was again utilized to obtain the dihydropyrido[1,2-a]indolone (DHPI) scaffold 66, which was crucial in our 2016 and 2017 total and formal syntheses of five indole alkaloids, (+)-limaspermidine (67), (+)-kopsihainanine (59), (-)-quebrachamine (68), (+)-aspidospermidine (69), and (-)-goniomitine (70).48,49 Most recently, Qin in 2017 leveraged ligand 1a to synthesize the quaternary indole 71, paving the way to a divergent synthesis of five Kopsia indole alkaloids: (-)-fruticosine (72), (+)-methyl chanofruticosinate (73), (-)-isokopsine (74), (-)-kopsine (75), and (-)-kopsanone (76).50\nFinally, in 2018 Li and co-workers reported an asymmetric synthesis of the pentacyclic anti-tumor alkaloid (-)-cephalotaxine (79) using decarboxylative alkylation on allyl enol carbonate precursor 77.51 Here, they utilized ligand 5 to attain 78 with high enantioselectivity; in contrast, (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a) provided the desired product in only 80% ee.\nScheme 15. Total synthesis of (-)-cephalotaxine\nThese aforementioned natural product syntheses highlight the impressive synthetic versatility of enantioselective allylic alkylation reactions facilitated by PHOX ligands. Especially in the cases of indole alkaloid syntheses, decarboxylative alkylation was used to synthesize a range of structurally diverse quaternary stereocenter-bearing intermediates, which were advanced toward the desired natural products. Additionally, electron-deficient variants of (S)-t-BuPHOX (1a) such as (S)-(CF3)3-t-BuPHOX (5) have demonstrated superior efficacy in many instances, and are likely to find even wider use in the future, especially toward the synthesis of novel all-carbon quaternary stereocenter-bearing scaffolds using decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation methodologies. The PHOX ligand class has shown extensive versatility in various transition-metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations, thus enabling access to novel and biologically important chemical space. Their modular nature ensures the continual development of new electronically and sterically modified versions with even greater catalytic potential."

The dried flask is then charged with nitric acid (150 mL, 18% (v/v) in H2O) and fitted with a reflux condenser complete with a nitrogen inlet, a thermometer, and the final neck is sealed with a rubber septum (Figure 1) (Notes 2, and 3). Slow stirring of the solution (150 rpm) is commenced. The rubber septum is briefly removed, the solid (S,R)-Noscapine (20 g, 48.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added to the flask in a single portion at 25 \u00b0C, after which the rubber septum is replaced (Notes 4 and 5). The mixture is observed to turn from a white to slightly yellow turbid solution. (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Experimental set-up and addition of (2S,3R)-noscapine\nThe flask is then lowered into a pre-heated oil bath maintained at 50 \u00b0C (Note 6) with the internal temperature monitored throughout the reaction via the thermometer. The mixture forms a yellow mixture upon heating and dissolves completely at 38 \u00b0C. During the reaction, a series of color changes are observed: the solution changes color from yellow to brown, then brown to red, and finally red to yellow (Note 7). Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture consists of a yellow solution and a white precipitate, which gradually forms during the course of the reaction (Note 8) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

The flask is immersed in a 23 \u00b0C water bath and the geranyl bromide solution added dropwise over 10 min to the vigorously stirring suspension (Figure 1A). After complete addition, the grey, heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 1.5 h at 23 \u00b0C under an atmosphere of nitrogen, at which time stirring is stopped and excess zinc allowed to settle.

            "Alkenes harboring allylic heteroatoms are a ubiquitous functional arrangement in organic molecules.2,3,4 Their enantioselective synthesis under mild conditions is of broad utility for the preparation of many biologically active and complex organic structures. One opportunity for such enantioselective syntheses is the use of nucleophilic heteroatom species in allylic substitution reactions of prochiral alkenes containing allylic leaving groups. Palladium(II) catalysts are ideal reagents for these transformations because of their chemoselectivity as \u03c0-acids,5 with catalyst complexes having planar chirality proven to be particularly effective for achieving antarafacial nucleopalladation of C-C double bonds.6 Our group has utilized a family of chiral cobalt oxazoline palladacycle (COP) catalysts (Figure 1), originally discovered by Richards,6a for the activation of alkenes for enantioselective nucleopalladation/deoxypalladation rearrangement and allylic substitution reactions.7,8 In 2007, we reported scalable syntheses of the three COP complexes depicted in Figure 1,9 as they had proven to be excellent catalysts for the transformation of prochiral allylic trichloroacetimidates to either branched allylic trichloroacetamides or branched allylic esters in good yields and enantioselectivities (Scheme 1).10 Although some attempts have been made to replicate the effectiveness of the COP catalysts with less elaborate ligand scaffolds, the COP complexes remain the most selective catalysts for these transformations.6c,7 High enantioselectivities, essentially complete selectivity for formation of the branched allylic product, and mild reaction conditions that tolerate most functional groups-notably those that are base labile-are typical of COP-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions.10,12 These features provide the COP family of catalysts with complementary reactivity to many catalytic enantioselective allylic functionalizations that proceed via \u03c0-allyl intermediates.13\nFigure 1. The COP family of catalysts\nAt the time of our report of the syntheses of the COP complexes, only the enantioselective trichloroacetimidate rearrangement and allylic substitution with carboxylic acid nucleophiles had been described (Scheme 1). In the following years, a number of new COP-catalyzed transformations and synthetic applications of the allylic products have been reported. These advances will be the focus of this Addendum.14\nScheme 1. Applications of COP catalysts in allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement and allylic ester synthesis\n(I) Rearrangements\nAdditional transformations involving formal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements of 1,3-dihetero-1,5-hexadienes catalyzed by COP catalysts have been reported. It has been found that the complex [COP-Cl]2 , having bridging chloride ligands, is generally the optimal catalyst for these applications.\nThe enantioselective synthesis of allylic thiocarbamates by the palladium-catalyzed rearrangement of carbamothioates has been described by our and the Clayden research groups (Scheme 2).15,16 Typical of this family of palladium-catalyzed rearrangements, the substrate scope was fairly broad and included unprotected alcohols and secondary carbamates. Clayden extended this chemistry by utilizing a subsequent lithiation/Smiles-type rearrangement to enable the synthesis of fully-substituted sulfur stereocenters. This tactic overcame the inability of the COP complexes to catalyze rearrangements of allylic precursors having two substituents at the site of C-S bond formation. The stereoselectivity of this two-step sequence was generally high, with the configuration of the newly formed stereocenter being determined by the enantioselectivity of the COP-catalyzed rearrangement.15\nScheme 2. Enantioselective rearrangements of allylic carbamothioates\nThe enantioselective introduction of nitrogen-containing stereocenters by COP-catalyzed allylic rearrangements has been extended to allylic alcohol precursors other than trichloroacetimidates. Batey recognized the opportunity to utilize 2\u2011allyloxypyridines as imidate surrogates in palladium-catalyzed rearrangements using COP complexes (Scheme 3).17 These transformations provide N-allylpyridones in good yields and enantioselectivities using [COP-Cl]2. It was found that generation of a cationic complex by removal of the chloride ligands with silver trifluoroacetate significantly enhanced the rate of the rearrangement without reduction in enantioselectivity. Batey also demonstrated that other allyloxy-substituted nitrogen heterocycles, including quinolines and benzothiazoles, could be transformed in a similar fashion to N-allylated products in good yields and enantioselectivities. In addition, Batey reported the COP-catalyzed rearrangement of iminodiazaphospholidines to provide chiral allylic phosphoramides, which upon reaction with 1 M HCl gave the corresponding allylic tosylamide.18 In the presence of silver trifluoroacetate and [COP-Cl]2, this rearrangement proceeded in moderate to good yields and modest to high enantioselectivities. As a method for enantioselective synthesis of chiral amines, the COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement has a broader scope and provides products readily converted to the corresponding primary amine.\nScheme 3. Enantioselective rearrangements to generate C-N bonds: allyloxypyridines and iminodiazapholidines\nThe typically broad scope, mild conditions, and high enantioselectivity of COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangements has led to this reaction being employed as a key step in the enantioselective construction of various nitrogen-containing molecules (Scheme 4). A common tactic is to strategically combine this reaction with ruthenium-catalyzed alkene cross-metathesis or ring-forming metathesis. For example, Han followed the COP-catalyzed enantioselective rearrangement of an allylic alcohol with an aminomercuration/demercuration reaction to construct 2,6-disubstituted piperidines.19 Cross metathesis was then employed to append a 2-octanone side chain to yield, after alkene hydrogenation, the CNS-active piperidine alkaloid (+)-iso-6-cassine. Combining COP-catalyzed allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangements with ring-closing metathesis (RCM) to construct nitrogen heterocycles was reported by Aldrich and Richards.20,21 After palladium-catalyzed rearrangement, both strategies appended an allyl or homoallyl group to the resulting nitrogen. Ruthenium-catalyzed RCM of the resulting dienes provided the targeted heterocycles. Aldrich utilized this strategy to construct a piperidinone inhibitor of biotin synthesis. Richards was able to synthesize a number of functionalized enantioenriched piperidines, pyrrolidines, quinolizidines, and indolizidines, including the natural products anisomycin and coniine. Sutherland also employed a palladium-catalyzed rearrangement/RCM strategy on dienol starting materials to construct amine-substituted carbocycles that were then elaborated to polyhydroxylated aminocarbocycles.22\nScheme 4. Applications of [COP-Cl]2-catalyzed rearrangements in synthesis\n(I) Rearrangements\nOne other important use of the COP family of catalysts is to promote enantioselective SN2'-type reactions of prochiral allylic imidates. Our original report of the intermolecular allylic esterification motivated us and others to pursue the utility of other nucleophiles in the enantioselective synthesis of branched allylic substitution products.9c,d In general, successful nucleophiles needed to be relatively acidic (pKa <12) in order to participate in the S N2' reactions. This requirement is particularly important for intermolecular reactivity and presumably results from the need to eventually protonate the imidate leaving group. Furthermore, intermolecular substitutions catalyzed by the COP family of catalysts require the use of the Z-allylic imidate in order to suppress competing [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement by increasing the steric demand of the intramolecular iminopalladation step.\nPhenols were quickly found to be particularly useful nucleophiles for the generation of allyl aryl ethers (Scheme 5).23 SN2' substitution onto prochiral Z\u2011allylic imidates provided the corresponding allyl aryl ethers in good yields and consistently high enantioselectivities. As in the synthesis of allylic esters, the palladacyclic complex [COP-OAc]2 was ideal for this transformation of the Z-allylic imidates. In the course of these studies, a new complex, [COP\u2011NHCOCCl3]2, was discovered in which the bridging acetate ligands were replaced by bridging trichloroacetamidates.24 This complex was the first catalyst capable of promoting the intermolecular SN2' substitutions of E-allylic imidates. For reasons still not well understood, [COP-NHCOCCl3]2 is a comparatively poor catalyst for the allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, allowing useful yields of allyl aryl ethers to be produced without the formation of significant amounts of allyl amide byproducts. Unfortunately, this reactivity could not be translated to the allylic esterification, as [COP-NHCOCCl3] 2 readily converts to a carboxylate-ligated species in the presence of carboxylic acids.12 These carboxylate complexes, like [COP-OAc]2, are also competent catalysts for the competing allylic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement.\nScheme 5. Enantioselective intermolecular SN2' reactions with phenol nucleophiles\nCatalytic, enantioselective, intramolecular substitution reactions with phenol nucleophiles were also realized with [COP-OAc]2 (Scheme 6).25 Vinylchromans and other oxygen heterocycles were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities. In particular, E-alkenes were found to be the ideal substrates, as the corresponding Z isomers provided products having significantly reduced enantioselectivities. This intramolecular reactivity allowed two firsts for the COP family of complexes: (1) the stereoselective synthesis of fully-substituted stereocenters in good enantioselectivity, albeit in low yield; and (2) the use of allylic acetates as effective and more atom-economical leaving groups giving allylic substitution products in comparable yields and enantioselectivities. In this latter case, basic potassium fluoride was required to promote the reaction.\nScheme 6. Enantioselective synthesis of 2-vinyl substituted oxygen heterocycles\nJirgensons also reported a COP-catalyzed intramolecular substitution of allylic bis-trichloroacetamidates (Scheme 7).26 In this case, the E-alkene stereoisomer of the bisimidate was required to achieve high yield and diastereoselectivity.\nScheme 7. Synthesis of a vinyloxazoline by a [COP-Cl]2-catalyzed substitution reaction\nThe allylic substitution reaction has found some use in total synthesis efforts. For instance, Kirsch demonstrated an iterative approach for the synthesis of 1,3-polyols.27 This strategy utilizes a ring-closing metathesis to generate a 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrone intermediate. Conversion of this lactone to theZ-allylic imidate allowed for a subsequent COP-catalyzed S N2' reaction to establish the next stereocenter. Kirsch demonstrated that this method could be used to construct all of the possible stereoisomers of 1,3-polyols with high levels of catalyst control, providing programmed access to polyketide scaffolds. Kirsch employed this iterative approach to synthesize polyrhacitides A and B.28 Kirsch also utilized the [COP-OAc]2-catalyzed allylic ester synthesis in his syntheses of rugulactone and chloriolide.27b\nScheme 8. Iterative strategy for 1,3-polyols utilizing COP-catalyzed SN2' reactions\nConclusion\nSeveral advances in the utility of the COP family of palladacyclic catalysts have been realized in recent years. These catalysts have proven to be relatively general enantioselective catalysts for both bimolecular and intramolecular allylic substitution reactions involving heteropalladation/deoxypalladation steps. We anticipate that these complexes will continue to find use in similar reactions where mild conditions and high selectivity for forming the branched product are paramount."

            "For the past 50 years, benzynes and related arynes have been a major subject of study among physical organic chemists due to their unusual electronic and structural properties. However, the utility of these strained intermediates in the domain of chemical synthesis has only relatively recently undergone a vibrant expansion. The direct insertion of aryne and heteroaryne moieties into carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom \u03c3 bonds presents an intriguing and unique strategy for the rapid functionalization of aryl and heteroaryl systems. Following our 2009 Organic Syntheses article on the acyl-alkylation of arynes with \u03b2-ketoesters,2 there have been numerous reports of related transformations involving these highly reactive intermediates. This discussion addendum is intended to document advances made in the field of (hetero)arynes since our initial disclosure. Topics covered will be divided as follows: recent methods for the acyl-functionalization of arynes, syntheses of related strained systems, applications in heterocycle synthesis, miscellaneous transformations, and strategic uses in natural product synthesis. A supplemental review on aryne insertions into \u03c3 bonds is available.3 Applications of arynes in transition metal catalysis will not be discussed in detail, however there are thorough reviews on the subject.4,5\nAcyl-functionalization of Arynes\nYoshida reported an analogous acyl-alkylation method to ours, but using trifluoromethyl ketones (2, Scheme 1).6 The trifluoromethyl group is required because it enhances the acidity of the \u03b1-keto C-H bonds. The authors note that the presence of bulky R groups on the aryl system of 2 results in competitive O-addition of the enolate intermediate.\nScheme 1. Aryne insertion into benzyl trifluoromethyl ketones\nOur lab has discovered a related insertion of arynes into various symmetrical imides 3 to afford acyl-aminated arenes 4 (Scheme 2).7 The difunctionalized products can be derivatized to quinolones and indoles. Christmann and coworkers later applied the principles of flow chemistry to this acyl-amination protocol with unsymmetrical imides, achieving the total synthesis of several natural products.8\nScheme 2. Aryne insertion into imides\nThe Biju group disclosed an amino-carboxylation of arynes using aniline derivatives (Scheme 3).9 This method offers a divergent approach for the synthesis of differentially substituted acyl-aminated arenes depending on the electronics of the aniline ring.\nScheme 3. Tunable acyl-amination of arynes with anilines\nArynes in Heterocycle Synthesis\nPerhaps the greatest recent synthetic advances in aryne chemistry are dedicated to the one-step construction of heterocycles (Figure 1). Larock provides an excellent review on the subject.10 The Larock group has also disclosed numerous aryne annulation approaches for the synthesis of dihydrobenzisoxazoles (5),11 indazoles (6),12,13 and pyrido[1,2-a]indoles (7 and 8).14 Shioji and coworkers disclosed the preparation of xanthones (9), xanthenes, and xanthols using arynes.15 Our lab has reported the divergent synthesis of iminoindenones and iminoisobenzofurans (10) via a three-component procedure.16 We have also disclosed the one-pot preparation of 3-hydroxyisoquinolines (11) through an acyl-alkylation/condensation approach.17 Additionally, we reported the formation of N-phenyl acridone (12) by means of a C-N insertion of \u03b2-lactam.18 The Studer lab disclosed the rapid synthesis of N-substituted carbazoles (13) by reacting arynes with nitrosoarenes.19 Greaney and coworkers prepared phenoxathiin-dioxides (14) via a thia-Fries/cyclization process.20 The Kobayashi group reported the formation of isocoumarins (15) via a Pd-catalyzed three-component reaction between arynes, alkynes, and carbon dioxide.21 Isocoumarins can also be prepared under transition-metal-free conditions.22 Biju presented methods for the synthesis of oxaphosphacycles (16),23 phthalimides (17),24 and indoles (18).25 The Greaney lab has also synthesized indoles from arynes by means of a Fischer indole-type reaction.26 The Miyabe group reported the synthesis of benzofurans (19).27 They have also discovered the cycloaddition between arynes and DMF to afford 4-aminobenzopyrans such as20.28 The Li group prepared benzothiazoles (21) by means of a relay aryne sequence.29 Lastly, Su and coworkers prepared 2-arylated benzoxazoles (22) by means of a domino aryne reaction.30\nFigure 1. Various heterocycles recently assembled by aryne annulation methods\nMethods for the Synthesis Heteroarynes and Other Strained Intermediates\nIn 2010, our lab reported the formation of highly substituted aryne precursors and their potential synthetic applications in the construction of complex molecules (Figure 2).31 The marked carbons denote the preferred site of selective nucleophilic attack following aryne formation.\nFigure 2. Synthesizable highly substituted aryne precursors\nThe laboratory of Garg has investigated various insertion strategies with heteroarynes and other strained ring systems. Because many of these reactions result in unsymmetrical products, they have computationally derived a model for predicting the regioselectivity during the insertion step based on angle distortion.32,33 This model has been exploited for the regioselective insertion of indolynes,34 pyridynes,35,36 piperidynes,37 as well as various oxacyclic alkynes (Figure 3).38 Contemporaneously, the Danheiser lab reported the first preparation and diverse applications of N-tosylpiperidynes.39 It is worthwhile to note that the preferred site of nucleophilic attack may be either enhanced or overturned depending on the substitution pattern on the heteroaryl ring. The chemistry of pyrimidynes has also been investigated, but there have been no reports of their successful formation.40\nFigure 3. Strained heterocycles studied recently by the Garg and Danheiser labs\nSimilar insertion strategies have been achieved with strained non-aromatic carbocycles such as cyclopentyne (23, Figure 4),41 cyclohexyne (24), and cyclic allene 25.42\nFigure 4. Strained non-aromatic ring systems\nThe Hoye group has vigorously studied the generation of arynes via an unusual hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction (HDDA, Figure 5).43,44 Areas of study in the field are numerous, including Lewis-acid-promoted C-H insertion,45 domino reactions,46,47 photochemistry,48,49 mechanistic studies,50,51 multicomponent reactions,52 and natural product diversification.53 The regioselectivity for the ensuing insertion process is influenced by both the choice of nucleophile and the substituents on the aryne system.54 The Lee group has demonstrated that these HDDA adducts can also participate in ene reactions.55\nFigure 5. A hexadehydro-Diels-Alder affords an aryne\nThe advent of silylaryl-1,3-ditriflates such as 26 has given rise to aryne relay chemistry (Scheme 4). Li and coworkers demonstrated the utility of these substrates as a means to generate trifunctionalized systems with thioamides, furnishing benzothiazoles (27).29 A plausible mechanism for this process is shown below. They have also achieved similar relay chemistry with sulfoxides56 and sulfonamides.57,58,59 In 2016, Yoshida reported an advancement of this concept.60 The Li group discovered that these latent 1,2-benzdiynes can also participate in ene reactions.61\nScheme 4. One-pot elaboration of 1,2-benzdiyne precursor 26 to benzothiazole 27\nMiscellaneous Transformations\nMany recent methods involving arynes are not readily classifiable in the above sections. This section provides a brief survey of such transformations. The Greaney group has discovered a means of difunctionalizing arynes with thioureas to afford thioaryl amidines.62 They also pioneered other heterofunctionalization strategies via three-component coupling63 and Truce-Smiles rearrangement.64 The Biju group has found many novel applications of arynes, including their ability to induce 2,3-Stevens rearrangements in allylthioethers.65,66 They have also identified arynes as latent aryl anion equivalents.67 The Studer lab has reported the formation of ortho-sulfinylaryl vinyl ethers,68 biphenyls,69 trialkylstannyl arylphosphanes,70 and sulfonium ylides71 by means of aryne insertion chemistry. The Lautens group has actively explored the applications of the intramolecular aryne-ene reactions.72,73\nDespite a resurgent interest in the study of benzyne, there remain relatively few methods for the preparation of the trimethylsilylaryl triflate precursor (1, Scheme 5).74 In 2009, the Garg lab reported a facile synthesis of precursor 1 in three steps starting from phenol (28).75 Thus, 28 was treated with isopropyl isocyanate (29) to afford carbamate 30. Following N-silylation, a directed ortho-lithiation and subsequent trapping with TMSCl provides silylarene 31 upon acidic workup. The carbamate functionality of 31 is next cleaved by aminolysis to form transient phenol derivative 32, which is converted to silylaryl triflate 1 by reaction with N-phenyl triflimide.\nScheme 5. Garg's 3-step synthesis of benzyne precursor 1\nThere has been one report harnessing arynes and cyclic alkynes for the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centers (Scheme 6).76 Chiral enamine auxiliaries bearing 9-anthryl substituents were found to confer the highest levels of stereoinduction.\nScheme 6. Asymmetric formation of quaternary centers with arynes\nArynes in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn recent years, arynes have enjoyed a privileged role in total synthesis. For more information, we recommend consulting two reviews77,78 and the references therein. In 2010, our lab performed an enantioselective synthesis of (-)-curvularin (34, Scheme 7) and (\u2212)-diplodialide C via aryne acyl-alkylation.79 The requisite macrocycle 33 was constructed by means of a ring-closing metathesis.\nScheme 7. Concise synthesis of 34 enabled by aryne acyl-alkylation\nSimilarly, Yoshida and coworkers presented an expedient approach to the synthesis of cytosporone B (35, Scheme 8), relying on an acyl-alkylation disconnection.80\nScheme 8. Retrosynthetic analysis of 35 leads to an aryne insertion\nThe Buszek group reported the total synthesis of cis-trikentin A (37, Scheme 9) using an indolyne cycloaddition.81 In this case, the indolyne intermediate is generated from dibromide 36 via lithium-halogen exchange and subsequent elimination.\nScheme 9. Facile synthesis of 37 via an indolyne cycloaddition\nLikewise, the Garg lab reported a synthesis of various N-methylwelwitindolinones such as 3882 by means of an indolyne cyclization (Scheme 10).83,84,85,86,87 Here, indolyne formation is triggered by base-induced halide elimination. The authors note minor issues of competing O-addition of the enolate in intermediate 39.\nScheme 10. Garg's retrosynthetic analysis of 38 reveals an indolyne annulation\nArgade and coworkers disclosed the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-cruciferane (40, Scheme 11) using aryne chemistry.88 Notably, the crucial aryne insertion step occurs in excellent yield.\nScheme 11. Expedient total synthesis of 40 by aryne cyclization\nThe Garg lab has incorporated carbazolyne chemistry in the total syntheses of tubingensin A89 (41, Scheme 12) and tubingensin B.90 The labeled quaternary stereocenter in 41 is formed in good yield and with exquisite diastereoselectivity due to the rigid conformational constraints on the system.\nScheme 12. Retrosynthesis of tubingensin A (41) by carbazolyne annulation\nGarg has also synthesized indolactam-containing natural products such as indolactam V (43, Scheme 13).91 The strategically placed bromide substituent in 42 is essential for overturning the inherent regioselectivity associated with the key C-N bond-forming step.\nScheme 13. Synthesis of indolactam V (43) by indolyne amination\nThe Lee group leveraged HDDA chemistry for the rapid total synthesis of selaginpulvilin D (46, Scheme 14).92 It is interesting to note that despite occurring under formally oxidizing conditions, the benzyne intermediate arising from an intramolecular HDDA of tetrayne 44 undergoes in situ transfer hydrogenation by the action of cyclooctane to afford fluorenone 45.\nScheme 14. Lee's total synthesis of 46 hinges on an elegant oxidation/intramolecular HDDA/hydrogenation sequence\nIn 2018, the Sarpong lab reported the acyl-alkylation of benzyne derivative 47 to access the seven-membered carbocyclic core of the diterpenoid alkaloid cossonidine (Scheme 15).93 Once again, a bromide substituent is necessary in order to ensure proper regioselectivity.\nScheme 15. Sarpong's acyl-alkylation approach to the central seven-membered ring of cossonidine\nZhu and coworkers disclosed a novel heteroannulation of arynes using \u03b1-amino imides.94 This method was employed for the total synthesis of (+)-hinckdentine A (48, Scheme 16).\nScheme 16. Zhu harnessed a novel acyl-amination strategy for the total synthesis of 48\nRecently, our lab reported the non-biomimetic total syntheses of (-)-jorunnamycin A (50, Scheme 17) and (-)-jorumycin in 15 and 16 steps, respectively.95 Amid this route, one of the necessary isoquinoline monomers was prepared using aryne chemistry. In this instance, the acyl-alkylation product is subjected to in situ condensation with ammonium hydroxide to afford densely functionalized isoquinoline 49.17 Remarkably, four of the five carbon-based stereocenters present in 50 are set in one step via an iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Unlike previous approaches to these bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline natural products, this route is amenable to the synthesis of a diverse array of nonnatural analogs, because the aryne chemistry is independent of classical Pictet-Spengler approaches that have been employed in the syntheses of these alkaloids.\nScheme 17. Formation of isoquinoline monomer 49 en route to (-)-jorunnamycin A (50) and (-)-jorumycin\nConcluding Remarks\nClearly the field of aryne chemistry has experienced rapid growth over the last decade. In addition to the discovery of various methods strategically related to our initial acyl-alkylation disclosure, there have been many other impressive applications in the context of methods and total synthesis. Based on these recent developments, it is evident that these curious and highly reactive intermediates will continue to inspire chemists to discover new and synthetically useful reactions for the foreseeable future."

            "Enantiopure 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes and their dichlorodiol precursors have proven to be useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex natural products. Since 2000, the Organic Syntheses article2 and the primary reference3 have been cited over 100 times. While these C2 symmetric bis-electrophiles have most commonly been employed in the installation of anti-1,3 diol motifs, they have also recently been leveraged in development of new methods and utilized in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. These applications, as well as the use of these materials in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products, will be discussed.\nThe original procedure (Scheme 1A) utilizes a reversible acyl transfer reaction of acetylacetone (1) using aluminum trichloride and chloroacetyl chloride.4 The reaction is driven forward through removal of acetyl chloride by distillation and the resulting dichlorodione is isolated (57-58% yield) as copper complex 2. The dione is then liberated from the metal under acidic conditions and subjected to Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation5,6,7,8,9 under high pressure to give dichlorodiol R,R-3 in 40% yield after recrystallization, which undergoes double cyclization under basic conditions to form bis-epoxide R,R-4 (92% yield; >97% ee). The initial report also demonstrates the title compound's utility in synthesizing 1,3-diol motifs (Scheme 1B).3 Treatment of bis-epoxide 4 with unhindered nucleophiles affords symmetric anti-1,3-diols (5) in high yields (61-96%). Controlled monoadditions to bis-epoxide 4 using organolithium species at low temperatures in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt210 provide epoxy alcohols (6) in good yields (56-79%). These epoxy alcohols can be efficiently converted to differentially substituted anti-1,3-diols (7) upon treatment with a second nuceophile (63-89% yields), or converted to syn-1,3-diols through Mitsunobu inversion11,12 of the free hydroxyl. Early applications of these anti-1,3-diol strategies are highlighted in the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin13 and roflamycoin.14\nScheme 1. Synthesis of (R,R)-1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane; double addition and sequential addition to the bis-epoxide with organometallic nucleophiles\nSimultaneous Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin (11, Scheme 2), the ethereal tetrahydropyran (THP) ring provided a natural application of the double addition strategy.13 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with an excess of vinylmagnesium bromide in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuI at -78 \u00b0C provided bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 in 90% yield. Diol 8 underwent an acid-catalyzed transacetalization to afford high yields of acetal 9. The C2 symmetric acetal was then poised to undergo an intramolecular Prins cyclization15/desymmetrization with concomitant acetate trapping to provide THP-diacetate 10 in 42% overall yield. This noteworthy sequence leveraged the symmetry of the bis-epoxide to correctly install the 2,4,6-cis-THP stereochemistry, as well as the C19 stereocenter. The bis-homoallylic diol (8) generated by this double addition strategy has proven useful in a number of other synthetic programs.\nScheme 2. Rychnovsky's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin\nThe synthesis of (+)-obolactone (14, Scheme 3) by Br\u00fcckner and Walleser employed the same conditions from the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin to transform bis-epoxide R,R-4 to bis-homoallylic diol S,S-8.16 Diol 8 was then protected using 2,2-dimethoxypropane under acidic conditions to provide acetonide 12 in 95% yield. One of the alkene functional groups of the C2-symmetric acetal underwent a subsequent symmetry-breaking Wacker oxidation.17,18,19 Treatment of acetonide 12 with catalytic PdCl2 under an atmosphere of oxygen using CuCl as the stoichiometric oxidant afforded a 64% yield of methyl ketone 13, with over-oxidation to the diketone also observed (18% yield). The methyl ketone functionality of 13 was critical for the installation of the dihydro-\u03b3-pyranone moiety in the natural product, while the syn-orientation of the C\u00ad-O bonds was achieved through Mitsunobu inversion of the lactone stereocenter. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser specifically mention that while Krische and co-workers have reported on an impressive single-step procedure for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of bis-homoallylic diol (S,S-4) from 1,3-propanediol (Scheme 4),20 and have used this method extensively in the synthesis of polyketide natural products,21,22 the high cost of catalyst and ligand precluded their use on scale in this case.\nScheme 3. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's synthesis of (+)-obolactone\nScheme 4. Krische's one-step synthesis of S,S-8.\nBr\u00fcckner and Walleser also used bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 as the starting point for their work on a unified synthetic strategy toward ent-filipin III and ent-pentamycin (20 & 21), as shown in Scheme 5.23 Symmetry-breaking Mitsunobu inversion of bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 was achieved by treatment with crotonic acid, triphenyl phosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) in toluene to give monoester 16 in 62% yield. The free hydroxyl group of 16 was then converted to sulfonate ester 17 in high yield using vinylsulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. Tetraene 17 was subjected to double ring closing metathesis using Grubbs II catalyst24 in toluene at 100 \u00b0C to afford bicyclic intermediate 18. This bicyclic lactone was further elaborated to acetonide 19 constituting a synthesis of the C1-C10 or \"southwestern\" portion of the polyketides.\nScheme 5. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's approach to ent-filipin and ent-pentamycin\nAnother example of double addition using an organomagnesium nucleophile was utilized in Eustache and co-workers synthesis of attenol A (27, Scheme 6).25 Treatment of bis-epoxide R,R-4 with 3-butenylmagnesium bromide in the presence of CuI at -40 \u00b0C provided diene diol S,S-22 in 88% yield. Diol S,S-22 was then converted to PMP-acetal 23 in high yield (88%) through acid-catalyzed transacetalization. Reductive cleavage of the benzylic C-O bond by the action of sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions afforded PMB ether 24 in 76% yield. The free hydroxyl group of mono-protected diol 24 was then poised for intermolecular iodoetherification when treated with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in the presence of potassium carbonate. The resulting differentially protected diol derivative 25 was obtained in 80% yield and carried forward as inconsequential mixture of diastereomers to access spiroketal 26 en route to attentol A.\nScheme 6. Eustache's synthesis of attenol A\nPerhaps the most complex example of simultaneous double addition is seen in Smith and Pitrem's synthesis of the Schrieber trisacetonide in their synthesis of mycoticins A and B (33 & 34, Scheme 7).26,27 This single-pot, five-component linchpin coupling strategy utilized bis-epoxide S,S-4 as the central five carbon piece of the C16-C28 fragment of the natural products. The sequence began with lithiation of silyl dithiane 28, which opened the epoxide of (-)-benzyl glycidyl ether 29 to give alkoxide 30. Upon warming, the transient intermediate underwent an intramolecular [1,4]-Brook rearrangement28,29 to generate an organolithium poised for double addition into bis-epoxide S,S-4 to afford diol 31 in 59% overall yield. This remarkable sequence forged four C-C bonds and provided the entire carbon framework of the C16-C28 fragment in a single operation.\nScheme 7. Smith's synthesis of mycoticin A and B\nIn an interesting example of post-double addition functionalization, Tang and Werness were able to exploit the C2-symmetry of bis-epoxide R,R-4 to synthesize the 2,5-cis-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran (THF) core of the marine sesquiterpene (-)-kumausallene (37, Scheme 8).30 Their strategy employed bis-allylic diol R,R-35, which was accessed through a protocol developed by Hanson and co-workers (vide infra). Treatment of diol 35 with a catalytic amount of PdCl2 in the presence of CO and NaOAc using CuCl2 as the stoichiometric oxidant initiated a carbonylative cascade reaction31,32 to provide bicyclic lactone 36 in 87% yield. This key transformation installed the requisite stereochemistry of the central portion of the natural product, as well as appropriate synthetic handles for further functionalization.\nScheme 8. Tang's synthesis of (-)-kumausallene\nSequential Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nFor Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of roflamycoin (45), the hemiketal-pyran linkage required differential substitution (Scheme 9) and demonstrated the power of the sequential double addition strategy.14 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with a stoichiometric amount of (benzyloxy)methyllithium 38 and BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C provided mono-addition adduct 39, which was then treated with the organolithium formed from transmetallation of 2,2-bis-(tributyltin)dithiane 40. This single-pot procedure afforded dithiane diol 41 in 56% overall yield. Subsequent acetonide formation and transmetallation provided a competent nucleophile for direct displacement of dibromide42, which itself was derived from dichlorodiol R,R-3. The resulting bis-acetonide (43) was obtained in 60% overall yield and provided a rapid access to tris-acetonide 44, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the hemiketal-pyran moiety of 45. Similar sequential addition strategies have proven to be useful as well.\nScheme 9. Rychnovsky's synthesis of roflamycoin\nThough most commonly used in the synthesis of polyketide natural products, Evans and co-workers were able to employ bis-epoxide R,R-4 in the synthesis of polycyclic guanidinium alkaloid (-)-batzelladine D (51, Scheme 10).33 Addition of the transiently formed cuprate derived from catalytic CuCN and octyl Grignard reagent in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C led to formation of mono-addition adduct 46 in 71% yield. The resulting epoxy alcohol (46) was then treated with the ylide generated from the in situ deprotonation of trimethylsulfonium triflate to afford 95% yield of anti-1,3-diol 47. Conversion of diol 47 to cyclic carbonate 48 was achieved in 90% yield by treatment with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and pyridine. Cyclic carbonate 48 was then employed as the electrophile in a rhodium-catalyzed allylic amination.34 The LiHMDS-mediated deprotonation of dihydropyrimidinone 49 provided a nucleophile, which in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst and trimethyl phosphite displaced the allylic carbonate to forge the C-N bond of 50 in high conversion and selectivity (84% yield; dr \u2265 30:1). This sequence rapidly provided the required stereochemistry for the bicyclic guanidinium portion of (-)-batzelladine D.\nScheme 10. Evan's synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D\nHanson's synthesis of chiral bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triester building blocks\nWhile Mioskowski's conversion of epoxides to homologated allylic alcohols35 was used in Evans' synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D, the use of this transformation as it pertains to 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes was pioneered by Hanson and co-workers for their research in synthesis of phosphate triester building blocks.36 The simultaneous double addition of sulfonium ylides onto either chiral bis-epoxide S,S-4 or dichlorodiol S,S-3 to give the corresponding bis-allylic diol S,S-35 proceeded in high yields (76% and 80% yield, respectively) (Scheme 11).37 This was a critical reaction in the synthesis of chiral phosphate triesters. Condensation of diol 35 onto POCl3 in the presence of Et3N and DMAP provided cyclic chlorophosphate diester 52. Final chloride displacement was carried out with lithium allyloxide in THF at -40 \u00b0C to afford triene 53, which underwent a ring-closing metathesis reaction in the presence of Grubbs II catalyst24 to provide phosphate triester S,S,PS-54.\nScheme 11. Hanson's synthesis of tris-allylic phosphate triesters\nHanson and co-workers have shown these tethered phosphate esters to be versatile intermediates for organic synthesis.36 In addition to synthesis of complex natural products such as those seen in Figure 1,38,39,40,41 recent extensions of this technology include probing the complementary reactivity of the corresponding phosphite-borane tethers.42,43 While these reports demonstrate the utility of P-tethered building blocks, perhaps none more clearly highlight the versatility of these intermediates than Hanson's approach to dolabelide C.41 Retrosynthetic analysis of this 24-membered macrolide produced by the sea hare D. auricularia (58, Scheme 12) divided the macrolactone into two large fragments (59 and 60) that can come from the enantiomeric phosphate triesters R,R,PR-54 and S,S,PS-54.\nFigure 1. Complex products synthesized using phosphate triester building blocks\nScheme 12. Hanson's retrosynthetic analysis of dolabelide C\nSynthesis of the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C, shown in Scheme 13, began with cross metathesis of phosphate triester R,R,PR-54 and alkene 61 in the presence of the 2nd generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst44,45,46 to give phosphate diene 62. Regioselective reduction of the exocyclic alkene in 62 required treatment with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazine and Et3N as the phosphate esters are not tolerant of more basic diimide reduction protocols. The resulting cyclic alkene 63 was then subjected to a Pd-catalyzed formate reduction that regioselectively delivered hydride to the C10 position resulting in the desired terminal alkene 64. With a majority of the northwest coupling fragment assembled, alkene 64 was further elaborated to carboxylic acid 59 in 11 steps.\nScheme 13. Hanson's approach to the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C\nA similar cross metathesis/reduction strategy was employed for the 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment (Scheme 14) to convert S,S,PS-54 to cyclic alkene 67. In this case, regio- and diastereoselective methyl cuprate addition proceeded in an SN2\u2032 fashion to afford terminal alkene 68. This advanced intermediate was carried through another 10 steps to provide southwest fragment 60. Though containing a problematic MOM protecting group strategy, the 1st generation synthesis of this fragment also demonstrated the phosphate triester moiety's tolerance to both hydroboration/oxidation conditions, as well as an acidic PMB protection protocol.\nScheme 14. Hanson's 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment of dolabelide C\nHanson's chiral phosphate triesters have proven to be useful building blocks for organic synthesis with new modes of reactivity still to be discovered. Advancements in this technology were facilitated by the synthetic route developed for the bis-epoxide and dichlorodiol precursors, which speaks to the reliability of the procedure. In addition to enabling new technologies, these intermediates have also found utility in the context of providing straightforward access to enantioenriched variants of classically important synthetic intermediates.\nAub\u00e9's extension through synthesis of valuable chiral building blocks\nAs shown in Figure 2, 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenones (4-HCP) have long been a privileged scaffold in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, including prostaglandins, alkaloids and terpene natural products.47,48,49 As such, the ability to access either enantiomer of this class of molecules has been a long standing area of interest for synthetic organic chemists. Aub\u00e9 and co-workers provided a compelling strategy to synthesize a variety of hydroxyl protected 4\u00ad-HCP derivatives in enantioenriched forms.50 The synthetic strategy, shown in Scheme 15, involves using Hanson's protocol to access bis-allylic diol R,R-35 from dichlorodiol R,R-3. Monoprotection of C2-symmetric diol R,R-35 proceeded in high yields (66-95%) for a variety of protecting groups. The resulting dienes (72) were able to smoothly undergo a RCM reaction using Grubbs I catalyst51 to give cyclopentenol derivatives (73, 88-92% yields), which were then oxidized with pyridium chlorochromate to the corresponding cyclopentenones (74) in high yields (92-94%) on gram scale. In addition, this report also provided conditions for further functionalization of both the cyclopentenol derivatives and 4-HCPs.\nFigure 2. Select examples of natural products synthesized using 4-HCPs\nScheme 15. Aub\u00e9's synthesis of enantioenriched 4-HCP derivatives\nSingh and Aub\u00e9 used dichlorodiol R,R-3 as a key intermediate in their syntheses of spatially directed cyclohexane-1,3-diols (Scheme 16).52 Analogous to the monoprotection of bis-allylic diol R,R-35, dichlorodiol R,R-3 underwent monohydroxyl protection by the action of TIPSCl in the presence of n-BuLi to afford dichloride 75 in 92% yield. To synthesize cyclohexyl derivatives, dichloride 75 was then converted to chloroepoxide 76 in 95% yield under basic conditions. In the presence of Smith's linchpin dithiane 77, chloroepoxide 76 underwent an epoxide opening/Brook rearrangement sequence. The transient carbanion subsequently displaced the remaining chloride to provide differentially protected cyclohexane 78, which can be selectively deprotected in a variety of ways. This method is complementary to the work of Linclau et al., who used dithiane linchpin coupling on bis-epoxides (e.g. 4) to construct cyclopentyl nucleosides.53,54\nScheme 16. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of cyclohexyl trans-1,3-diols\nIn addition to cyclohexane-1,3-diols, Singh and Aub\u00e9 also used dichloride 75 to synthesize piperidine and thiane derivatives as well (Scheme 17). In the case of piperidine derivatives, dichloride 75 was first converted to diiodide 82 through a double Finkelstein reaction.55,56 This more potent bis-electrophile was primed to undergo a double displacement with benzylamine to give piperidine 83 in 88% yield. The increased nucleophilicity of sulfur meant that dichloride 75 was a competent bis-electrophile for the double displacement and provided thiane 85 in 88% yield when treated with sodium sulfide. These heterocycles also underwent standard silyl group cleavage to give the corresponding 1,3-diols (84 and 86) in high yields (94% and 92%, respectively).\nScheme 17. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of piperidinyl and thianyl trans-1,3-diols\nConcluding Remarks\nThe enantiopure forms of 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane (4) and dichlorodiol (3) have been used by many groups as chiral precursors for organic synthesis. The original procedure is convenient and scalable, providing access to either enantiomer based on readily available and inexpensive chiral BINAP ligands. Displacement at the primary positions lead to a variety of simple enantiopure cyclic and acyclic building blocks. These typically occur either through simultaneous double addition of organometallic nucleophiles to give C2 symmetric diols or sequential double addition to give asymmetric diols. While the resulting 1,3-diol motif has most commonly found utility in the context of polyketide natural product synthesis, applications to alkaloid and terpene natural products have also been described. In addition, this method has provided straightforward access to bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triesters and 4-hydroxycyclopentenones derivatives, themselves valuable synthetic intermediates. Based on these recent developments, 4 and 3 will continue to provide synthetic chemists with useful entry points for chiral synthesis and enable new modes of reactivity."

            "The title compound, henceforth designated dbcot, was first prepared in 1946.2 It typically served to prepare analogs of cod-complexes of transition metals. Anton and Crabtree found that dbcot is bound more tightly and is more electron with\u00addrawing than cod in complexes of low-valent transition metal ions.3 This ob\u00ad\u00adservation led to the first application of dbcot as a rea\u00adgent, the Crabtree test (1983),4 which was based on the finding that dbcot is an inhibitor of homo- but not heterogeneous transition metal catalysts. Per\u00adhaps due to difficulties associated with earlier syntheses, dbcot chemistry received wider attention only after 2002, when Wudl et al.5 reported a con\u00adve\u00adnient synthesis, which was some\u00adwhat improved by our group.\nThis discussion addendum is focused on uses of dbcot and a few deri\u00advatives in catalysis. Useful procedures for prepa\u00adra\u00adtion of these compounds are also outlined. Fun\u00adda\u00admental metalorganic and coordination che\u00admistry of dbcot have been reviewed recent\u00adly (2019)6 and are here only dis\u00adcus\u00adsed in conjunction with cata\u00adlysis.\n\nPreparation of Dbcot and Dbcot Derivatives\nThe procedures currently in use are all based on Wudl's work. The route to dbcot, as streamlined by us, has been used by several groups without problems. Nevertheless, members of one of the groups expressed concern about the lachrymatory effect of a,a'-dibromo-o-xylene and the use of carbon tetrachloride as solvent in the bromination step.7\nWudl's work was also directed at the diyne 7 and included a ring enlar\u00adgement of the commercially available dibenzosuberone (4) with trimethylsi\u00adlyldiazomethane to give the ketone 5 (70%) (Scheme 1).5 This ketone was used by Chen and Hartwig for the development of a second route to dbcot by adding a Shapiro reaction via the hydazone 6 to give dbcot (1) in 83% yield (Scheme 1).8\nScheme 1. A second practical route to dbcot (1)\nGr\u00fctzmacher et al.9 prepared a series of 5-aryl-dbcot derivatives from the ketone 5 in two simple steps (Scheme 2) and used them as ligands of transition metal catalysts. A chiral Rh-complex of 9a, obtained by resolution, gave promising results in an enantioselective Hayashi-Miyaura reaction. While the Rh-complex was stable against racemization, the free ligand (R)-9a underwent complete racemization by tub to tub interconversion within > 3 h at room temperature.\nScheme 2. A route to monoaryl substituted dbcot derivatives 9\nStrand et al.10 advanced the topic of asymmetric catalysis by using C2-symmetric derivatives 12 of dbcot (Scheme 3). Their synthesis commenced with the dibromide 2, which was transformed into the dione 10 according to a known procedure (Kornblum oxidation),11 which proceeded in good yield but required two equivalents of silver tosylate. The dione 10 was trans\u00adformed into the bis-triflate 11 by treatment with Tf2O. Finally, cross coup\u00adling using an Fe- and a Pd-catalyst, furnished 5,11-methyl- (12a) and 5,11-phenyl-dbcot (12b), respectively. Enantiomers of both 12a and 12b could be separated by semi-preparative chiral column chromatography. The enantiomers equilibrate by tub to tub isomerization with a barrier of \u00bb 30 kcal/mol; accordingly, racemization at room temperature is slow.\nThe benzologue 16 (dncot) of dbcot was already prepared in 1990 in low yield.12 A convenient high yield route was developed by Wender et al. (Scheme 4).13 a,a'-Dibromo-o-xylene served as starting material; the reaction with ethynyltrimethysilane furnished the dialkyne 13 in almost quantitative yield. Subsequent deprotection to give 14 was carried out in excellent yield with 3 equivalents of silver cyanide. In the meantime, catalytic methods (10 mol% of AgNO3) have been developed14 that likely would allow simpli\u00adfication of the deprotection step. Nickel-catalyzed [2+2+2+2]-cycloaddition to give 15 followed by oxidation furnished crystalline dncot (16) in high overall yield. Addition of bromine followed by base-promoted elimination gave the bromide 17. This allowed preparation of a variety of further de\u00adrivatives 18 of dncot by substitution or cross coupling reactions.\nScheme 3. Preparation of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives 12\nScheme 4. Preparation of dncot (15) according to Wender\n\nUses in Catalysis\n\nRhodium-Catalyzed 1,4- and 1,2-Additions of Arylboronic Acids\nInterest in dbcot as a constituent of catalysts rather than as an inhibitor, cf the Crabtree test, began after Hayashi and Carreira in 2003 introduced chi\u00adral dienes 19 and 20, respectively, as ligands of Rh-catalysts of the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction (Figure 1) 15,16a and an Ir-catalyzed kinetic resolution allylic substitution.16b\nRh-Complexes of dienes such as cod, 19 and 20 are not very stable. This observation induced Gr\u00fctzmacher et al. (2005)9 to employ Rh-complexes of the dbcot derivatives 9 as catalysts. The complex (R)-21b furnished excellent yield and modest but promising enantioselectivity for the 1,4-addition of phenylboronic acid to cyclohexen-2-one (Scheme 5).\nFigure 1. Chiral diene ligands and complexes\nScheme 5. Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\nFollowing the rule that C2-symmetry is an advantageous property of a chiral ligand, Strand and co-workers prepared the enantiomerically pure Rh-complexes (S,S)-22a and -22b (Figure 1) from the ligands 12a and 12b, respectively.10 With these, the expected high enantioselectivities were indeed ob\u00adtained with cyclic as well as acyclic enones and enoates (Scheme 6). In ad\u00addition, highly enantioselective 1,2-additions of arylboronic acids to a-keto\u00adesters were realized by the Strand group.10\nScheme 6. Use of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives in the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\n\nIridium-Catalyzed Allylic Substitutions\nThe Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution was introduced in 1997 and found immediate interest because of preference for the branched, chiral substitution product.17 Continuous development has led to two very robust and highly regioselective as well as enantioselective versions (type I, Scheme 7,18 and type II19)20 with many applications in the area of biologically active com\u00adpounds.21 Both versions rely on catalysts prepared from the complex [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and a chiral phosphine. Earlier on it was not clear, whether cod was incorporated into the active catalyst. It turned out that cod is preserved in type I and lost in type II substitutions. This finding was an incentive to explore dbcot-derived catalysts in type I substitutions.\nScheme 7. Ir-catalyzed enantioselective allylic substitutions of type I\nThere are several improvements to be gained by using dbcot-complexes in type I allylic substitutions: (a) Dbcot-Ir-complexes display enhanced ther\u00admal stability, because dbcot is stronger bound to IrI than cod. (b) Reactions with cod-complexes as catalysts require strict exclusion of oxygen. In stark contrast, the corresponding reactions with dbcot-complexes can be run under air and with aqueous solvents. (c) With cod, reactions often display unsatis\u00adfactory regioselectivity in case of aliphatic substituents R. With dbcot im\u00adprovement is gained because of its enhanced electron acceptor capacity.\nAn interesting example illustrating point (a) is due to Han et al. (Scheme 8).22 This (Tsuji) reaction involves a decarboxylative allylic substitution as the key step. With cod as an ancillary ligand, the reaction did not proceed up to a temperature of 85 \u00b0C and a reaction time of 24 h, presumably because of decomposition of the catalyst. A highly selective reaction occurred with the corresponding dbcot derived catalyst at 60 \u00b0C within 6 h.\nScheme 8. Tsuji-type decarboxylative allylic etherification\nPoint (b), stability of the catalyst against air and water, is illustrated by Scheme 9.23 Previous attempts to accomplish an allylic hydroxylation using cod containing Ir-complexes failed in our and another laboratory.24 With dbcot as an ancillary ligand and bicarbonate as a nucleophile, the reaction could be performed with excellent results. The requisite Ir-complexes were obtained in a very convenient way as described in Scheme 10.25\nScheme 9. Enantioselective allylic hydroxylation\nScheme 10. One pot preparation of (allyl)Ir complexes\nTosatti et al. needed to employ similarly polar (DMSO) and aerobic con\u00additions in the development of an array of drug lead-like highly polar amino acid derivatives.26,27 Use of cod as ancillary ligand furnished yields below 5%. With dbcot excellent yields of the branched (exclusively) products were obtained (Scheme 11). Peters, et al. used the similarly polar solvent dimethylformamide in combination with the complex 24 successfully for a sequential allylic substitution/aza-Cope rearrangement process.28\nScheme 11. Aerobic allylic substitutions with highly polar amines in DMSO as a solvent\nImprovement of regioselectivity, i. e. point (c) above, is another incentive for the replacement of cod by dbcot or dncot. Results, taken from reference 29 for cod/dbcot and reference 30 for dncot, are presented in Figure 2.29,30 It is apparent that the latter ligands induce improved regioselectivity in favor of the branched products; this is likely due to their enhanced electron withdrawing capacity in comparison to that of cod. The (R)-enantiomer of the final product in Figure 2 was required as starting material for total syntheses of the natural products (+)-crypt- and (+)-infectocaryone.31 Many further examples concerning the influence of dbcot on regioselectivity have been reported by the You group.32\nFigure 2. Results of reactions according to Scheme 7 using various diene ligands (ligand L2)\n\nMiscellaneous reactions\nSince 1995 Wender et al. have developed syntheses of cycloheptane derivatives via intra- and intermolecular Rh-catalyzed [5+2] cycloaddition reac\u00adtions.33 Over the years progress with respect to reactivity and regioselec\u00adtivity was achieved by introducing new Rh-catalysts. Currently three catalysts are being used of which one contains dncot as a ligand (Scheme 12). The crucial problems for the intermolecular reaction are regioselectivity and rate (Figure 3).13 The dncot-complex excelled particularly with respect to regioselectivity. The influence of the ligand was elucidated by dft calculations.34\nFigure 3. Catalysts used in [5+2] cycloaddition reactions\nScheme 12. [5+2] Cycloaddition reactions according to Wender et al. (DCE: 1,2-dichlorethane, TFE: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol)\nZhang et al. have studied polymerization of phenylacetylenes with Rh-cod as well as Rh-dbcot-complexes as catalysts (Scheme 13).35 Once more dbcot-complexes, such as 21a, excelled, displaying higher stability and acti\u00advity than cod-complexes due to stronger Lewis acidity caused by the high \u03c0-acidity of dbcot. Thus, on water polymerization under aerobic conditions became feasible. Facile recovery and re-use of the catalysts was possible due to their water-solubility.\nScheme 13. Use of a dbcot-complex as polymerization catalyst\nFinally, Gr\u00fctzmacher et al.36 have developed the Ru-catalyst 26, which is a hydrogenase mimic in that it is able to both catalytically split and produce H2 by stepwise release of electrons and protons (Scheme 14). Turnover num\u00adbers up to 252 were found for the hydrogenation of vitamin K3; the quinoid moiety, rather than a double bond, was selectivity hydrogenated in the case of vitamin K2.\nScheme 14. Hydrogenase mimic devised by Gr\u00fctzmacher et al."

            "\u03b1-Diazo ketones have numerous applications in organic synthesis, serving as key synthetic intermediates in a number of important processes such as cyclopropanation, the Wolff rearrangement, and various C-H and heteroatom-H insertion reactions.2\nThe most widely used methods for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo ketones3 employ the acylation of diazo alkanes and \"diazo group transfer\"4 involving the base-promoted reaction of sulfonyl azides with \u03b2-dicarbonyl and other active methylene compounds. Direct diazo transfer to ketone enolates usually is not feasible,5 but diazo transfer to simple ketones can be achieved in two steps by an indirect \"deformylative diazo transfer\" strategy pioneered by Regitz4 in which the ketone is first formylated and then treated with a sulfonyl azide reagent.\nUnfortunately, several important classes of \u03b1-diazo ketones cannot be prepared in good yield by these standard methods. \u03b1'-Diazo derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones generally cannot be prepared by deformylative diazo transfer in good yield, and acylation of diazomethane with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acid chlorides and anhydrides generally is not successful because of the facility of dipolar cycloaddition to conjugated double bonds which leads to the formation of mixtures of isomeric pyrazolines. Also problematic are diazo transfer reactions involving base-sensitive substrates such as certain \u03b1,\u03b2-enones and heteroaryl ketones. Finally, the relatively harsh conditions and lack of regioselectivity associated with the thermodynamically controlled Claisen formylation step in the \"deformylative\" diazo transfer procedure limit the utility of this method when applied to the synthesis of diazo derivatives of many enones and unsymmetrical saturated ketones.\nIn 1990 we described the utility of a detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer strategy involving the trifluoroacetylation of kinetically generated lithium ketone enolates.6 This procedure has been illustrated in two Organic Syntheses procedures from our lab7 (e.g., Scheme 1). In the general procedure, reaction of the ketone substrate with 1.1 equiv of lithium hexamethyldisilazide in THF produces the corresponding lithium enolate, which is acylated by exposure to 1.2 equiv of trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate (TFETFA) at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting \u03b1-trifluoroacetyl ketone is then treated at room temperature with a sulfonyl azide in acetonitrile containing 1.0 equiv of water and 1.5 equiv of triethylamine. Column chromatography on silica gel furnishes the desired \u03b1-diazo ketone in good to excellent yield.\nScheme 1. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer (Org. Synth. 2016 procedure)7b\n\nThe key feature of the new procedure is the activation of the ketone starting material as the corresponding \u03b1-trifluoroacetyl derivative. The use of TFETFA to activate ketones in this fashion had not previously been reported, although Doyle employed a similar strategy to achieve diazo transfer to a base sensitive N-acyloxazolidone derivative.8 We found TFETFA to be superior to other trifluoroacetylating agents [e.g., CF3CO2Et, (CF3CO)2O] and the reaction of ketone enolates with this ester takes place essentially instantaneously at -78 \u00b0C. By contrast, the formylation of ketone enolates with ethyl formate is usually carried out using sodium hydride or sodium ethoxide as base and generally requires 12 to 48 h at room temperature for complete reaction.\nOnly one equivalent of base is required for the trifluoroacetylation step; apparently the chelated tetrahedral intermediate is stable at -78 \u00b0C and the \u03b2-dicarbonyl product is not generated until workup. Interestingly, in some cases the choice of LiHMDS for the generation of the ketone enolate proved superior to the use of LDA; however, in other cases no significant difference in the yield of diazo ketone was observed.\nIn this Discussion Addendum we describe recent experimental developments and review selected examples of the application of the protocol in the synthesis of natural products and other compounds.\n\nExperimental Developments\n\nClose to 100 papers have appeared reporting on the application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reaction since our original communication (1990) and Organic Syntheses article (1996). For the most part, these applications have employed the standard procedure described in our original papers, but there have been some developments with regard to the experimental procedure and these are reviewed in this section.\n\nChoice of Trifluoroacetylating Agent\n\nAs mentioned above, a central feature of our method is the activation of the carbonyl compound substrate by acylation with trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate at low temperature. The advantage of this approach over the classic diazo transfer procedure has been confirmed in a number of subsequent reports. For example, Sampson found that attempted application of the classic Regitz deformylative diazo transfer procedure to lactone 3 led to oligomeric products and none of the desired \u03b1-diazo lactone.9 Presumably, opening of the lactone by ethoxide ion generated in the initial formylation initiates oligomerization under these Claisen condensation type conditions. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer, on the other hand, provided the desired \u03b1-diazo lactone in good yield since the less nucleophilic trifluoroethoxide ion is not reactive enough to attack the lactone under the conditions of the reaction (Scheme 2).\nScheme 2. Diazo transfer with lactone 3\n\n\nMethod of Enolate Generation\n\nSeveral amide bases have been employed for generation of the enolate in the initial trifluoroacetylation step. In our original study we found that LDA and LiHMDS gave similar results in the case of many ketones including acetophenone and acetylcyclohexene. NaHMDS and KHMDS also appear to function similarly to LiHMDS in these diazo transfer reactions. On the other hand, as we reported previously, we observed dramatic improvements in the yield of diazo transfer product when LiHMDS rather than LDA was used in the case of several aryl and heteroaryl ketones including 2-acetylfuran and 3-acetylthiophene.6\nSampson has reported that LDA is a superior base for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer in the case of esters and lactones.9 For example, less than 10% of 4 was obtained using LiHMDS, possibly due to slow or incomplete deprotonation of 3 with this base which is significantly weaker than LDA.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the application of LiTMP as base can prove advantageous in reactions involving unsymmetrical ketones. For example, as illustrated in Scheme 3, improvements in both yield and regioselectivity were observed using LiTMP in the case of methyl ketone 5.10\nScheme 3. Effect of base on diazo transfer with unsymmetrical ketone 5\n\nAs reported in our original study, TMS enol ethers can also be deployed as enolate precursors for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reactions. As shown in Scheme 4, Wild exploited this version of the diazo transfer strategy in his synthesis of the antimycotic natural product chlorotetaine.11 Silyl enol ether 8 was first generated by diastereoselective deprotonation of the corresponding ketone using the chiral base lithium (R,R)-bis(phenethyl)amide followed by silylation. Exposure of the silyl enol ether to CH3Li then liberated the lithium enolate which was subjected to trifluoroacetylation and diazo transfer with tosyl azide to furnish the desired diazo ketone 9.\nScheme 4. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer via a silyl enol ether\n\n\nChoice and Stoichiometry of Sulfonyl Azide Reagent\n\nAlthough tosyl azide has traditionally been the reagent of choice for effecting diazo transfer reactions, we found methanesulfonyl azide to be a more convenient and in some cases superior reagent. As pointed out by Taber,12 the use of this reagent has the advantage that excess mesyl azide as well as methanesulfonamide byproducts are easily separated from the desired diazo ketone product by extraction into dilute aqueous base during workup.\nUnfortunately, both tosyl and mesyl azide pose safety hazards that restrict their use in many laboratories and for industrial applications. The thermal stability and explosion hazard associated with various diazo transfer reagents have been evaluated and compared in an excellent recent study.13 In our published Organic Syntheses procedures7 we employed 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azide14 and 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide (\"p-ABSA\")15 as safer alternatives to mesyl azide. In our experience, all three sulfonyl azides are equally effective for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer, as shown in Scheme 5 for the case of enone 10, the substrate in our original Organic Syntheses procedure.7a Although mesyl azide has advantages with respect to atom economy and facility of product separation, on the basis of safety considerations, we generally recommend the use of p-ABSA, especially for larger scale preparative work.\nScheme 5. Comparison of diazo transfer reagents\n\nIn 1990 Evans and coworkers investigated how the ratio of azide formation vs. diazo transfer is affected by the choice of sulfonyl azide reagent and enolate counterion and found that diazo transfer is favored by the use of p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide.17 Although we obtained \u03b1-diazoacetophenone in only 21% yield using this reagent,6 other groups have reported successful diazo transfer using o-18 and p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide19,20,21 as the sulfonyl azide reagent with our protocol. Nakada, for example, reported the preparation of diazo ketone 13 using this modification of our method in a key step in their total synthesis of the polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol nemorosone (Scheme 6).20c\nScheme 6. Application of p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide in the diazo transfer reaction\n\nFinally, Brown has reported on the use of a polymer-bound sulfonyl azide reagent in our procedure,21a and Kumar has described the application of an \"ionic liquid-supported\" sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer step.22\nWith regard to stoichiometry, our original protocol called for the use of 1.5 equiv of sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer step. Besides being wasteful, the use of excess reagent can lead to complications in the isolation and purification of the desired diazo transfer product. It is therefore noteworthy that several groups have reported successful diazo transfer employing our protocol but with only 1.0-1.1 equiv of reagent (Scheme 7).23,24\nScheme 7. Application of 1.0-1.1 equiv of sulfonyl azide reagent in the diazo transfer reaction\n\nIn the case of our Organic Syntheses substrate 1 (Scheme 1), we found that when only 1.0 rather than 1.5 equiv of p-ABSA is used (under otherwise identical conditions) the desired product is obtained in ca. 10% lower yield and is difficult to separate from the ketone starting material.\nIt must be noted that while the great majority of laboratories have employed 1.0 to 1.5 equiv of sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer, in some cases the use of a large excess of reagent (3 to 6 equiv) has been reported. We can imagine that the use of a large excess of reagent may be advisable in the case of diazo transfer reactions carried out in the late stages of a total synthesis where the reaction is performed on a relatively small scale and the yield of product is of paramount importance.\nIn summary, in our experience the optimal amount of sulfonyl azide must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For some applications 1.0 to 1.1 equiv of reagent can be used, while for valuable substrates we recommend using 1.5 equiv of the sulfonyl azide to maximize yield and to facilitate the separation of product from any possible unreacted starting carbonyl substrate.\n\nChoice of Solvent, Base, and Inclusion of Water in the Diazo Transfer Step\n\nThe use of 1.0 equiv of water in the diazo transfer step does not appear to be essential since a number of reports describe the use anhydrous acetonitrile in reactions producing the desired diazo carbonyl compound in good yield (e.g., see Schemes 2, 7 (14 to 15), and 825). Unfortunately, none of these reports provide a comparison of the results of the reaction with and without the presence of water. We have found in the case of several aryl and heteroaryl ketones that the yield of diazo ketone generally differs by no more than 10% when the reaction is carried out under anhydrous conditions rather than in the presence of water. We conclude that the addition of water may not always be necessary and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nScheme 8. Diazo transfer under anhydrous conditions\n\nThe great majority of researchers have followed our original protocol and used triethylamine as the base in the diazo transfer step. Taber, however, obtained better results by using DBU in place of Et3N in a diazo transfer reaction involving an ester and using p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide as the sulfonyl azide reagent (Scheme 9).19\nScheme 9. Diazo transfer with DBU as base\n\n\nOther Experimental Aspects\n\nAnother variation on our original protocol involves \"telescoping\" the two steps of the original procedure and carrying out the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer as a one-pot operation. In this case, the intermediate trifluoroacetyl derivative is not isolated and the reaction mixture from the trifluoroacetylation step is treated directly with base and the sulfonyl azide reagent (e.g., Scheme 6). We have found that this \"one pot\" procedure frequently gives comparable results to reactions carried out with isolation of the intermediate \u03b2-dicarbonyl compound.\n\nScope and Applications of the Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer\n\nThe application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer method to several important classes of compounds is highlighted in this section.\nDiazo Transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-Enones\nAs noted earlier, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds generally do not undergo diazo transfer in good yield under the conditions of the classical deformylative diazo transfer procedure. Our need for an efficient method for accessing \u03b1'-diazo derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones motivated the development of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer procedure and its application to \u03b1,\u03b2-enones was highlighted in our original report (e.g., Scheme 10).6\nScheme 10. Diazo transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones\n\nDetrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer has proven to be a general and efficient method for synthesizing a variety of \u03b1'-diazo-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones beginning with both methyl and cyclic unsaturated ketones. In particular, we have employed this chemistry extensively for the preparation of precursors to (trialkylsilyl)vinylketenes (e.g., Scheme 11).26 Along with the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of diethyl 3-diazo-2-oxopropylphosponate pioneered by Burtoloso,27 this constitutes the most useful method for the synthesis of this valuable class of synthetic building blocks.\nScheme 11. Diazo transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones\n\nDiazo Transfer with Carboxylic Acid Derivatives\nIn 2000 we reported the extension of detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer to the preparation of \u03b1'-diazo derivatives of thiol esters and an example was subsequently published as an Organic Syntheses procedure (Scheme 12).28 As illustrated earlier, the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer method has also proven to be applicable to a wide range of lactones (e.g., Scheme 2)9 and carboxylic esters (e.g., Scheme 9).19,29\nScheme 12. Diazo transfer for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo thiol esters\n\nDiazo Transfer with Miscellaneous Substrates\nSince our original publication detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer has been applied for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo derivatives of phosphonate and sulfonate esters.\nAs shown in Scheme 13, Brisbois applied the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol to dimethyl methylphosphonate and obtained the Seyferth-Gilbert reagent (\"DAMP\") in 50% yield.30\nScheme 13. Synthesis of DAMP via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer\n\nIn 2005, Ye and Zhou reported the synthesis of a series of \u03b1-diazo sulfonate esters as cyclopropanating agents using the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol (Scheme 14).31\nScheme 14. Synthesis of \u03b1-diazo sulfonate esters via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer\n\nExamples of Inefficient Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer\nAlthough the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer procedure has proven to have broad scope, several cases of unsuccessful reactions have been reported (Scheme 15). Attempts by Porter and coworkers to prepare diazo ketone 36 were not successful due to a failure to obtain the intermediate trifluoroacetyl ketone in good yield.32 Trauner recently reported that diazo ketone 37 could only be obtained in low yield under the conditions of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol.33\nScheme 15. Diazo ketones not available via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer in good yield\n\nApplications of Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer in Natural Product Synthesis\nWe close with several examples of the application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reaction in the synthesis of key intermediates for the synthesis of natural products, illustrating the application of the method in the context of highly functionalized substrates.\nAs shown in Scheme 16, Abad and coworkers were able to achieve diazo transfer to the sterically congested diketone 38 as a key step in their total synthesis of antiquorin and several other atisane diterpenes.34\nScheme 16. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of diterpenes\n\nAcetylation of the hydroxy group in 40 followed by detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer on the resultant ester provided 41 in excellent yield; this diazo ester served as an intermediate in the synthesis of (+)-19-dehydoxyl arisandilactone A (Scheme 17).35\nScheme 17. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of nortriterpenoids\n\nDetrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer of the diene dione 42 served as a key step in the total synthesis of the sesquiterpene periconianone A by Reddy and coworkers (Scheme 18).36\nScheme 18. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of periconianone A"

            "In a well-ventilated hood a 500-ml., three-necked flask is immersed in an oil bath and fitted with a condenser and a mechanical stirrer; a T-piece is inserted through a rubber stopper placed in the top of the condenser. One lead of the T-piece is connected to a nitrogen supply and the other to a gas bubbler. cis-3,4-Dichlorocyclobutene [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 422 (1988)], 20 g. (0.16 mole), and 125 ml. of anhydrous benzene are added to the flask, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. Diiron nonacarbonyl, 25 g. (Note 1) is then added, the flow of N2 is stopped, and the mixture is heated to 50\u201355\u00b0, with stirring. After about 15 minutes the initial rapid evolution of carbon monoxide becomes greatly diminished and an additional 8 g. of the nonacarbonyl is added; additional 8-g. quantities are added at intervals (approximately 15 minutes), governed by the rate of carbon monoxide evolution. The addition is continued until no more carbon monoxide is liberated (Note 2), and the reaction mixture is stirred at 50\u00b0 for an additional hour. Approximately 140 g. of diiron nonacarbonyl is required for the complete conversion of the dichlorocyclobutene, the total reaction time being about 6 hours.\nThe contents of the flask are then filtered with suction through Filtercel and the residue, while kept in the Buchner funnel, is thoroughly washed with pentane until the washings are colorless (Note 3). The pentane and much of the benzene are evaporated from the combined filtrates with a water aspirator.\nThe residual liquid is transferred to a flask equipped with an efficient fractionating column and distilled under reduced pressure. Benzene is removed first, followed by considerable quantities of iron pentacarbonyl (b.p. 20\u00b0, 30 mm.); when the diiron nonacarbonyl has been removed, the pressure is reduced further and cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl2 is collected as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 47\u00b0 (3 mm.), yielding 13.8\u201314.4 g. (45\u201346% based on dichlorocyclobutene), (Note 4)."

The resulting solution is heated at gentle reflux for 2\u20133 days until the initial bromine color is discharged. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and after 1 hour is decanted from some polymeric material into a 2-l. distilling flask. Removal of the solvent by distillation at water bath temperatures with the aid of a water aspirator gives a black oil which is poured into 250\u2013300 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0). The mixture is heated, dissolving the oil, and the solution is stored at \u221225\u00b0 in a freezer for 12 hours. Filtration on a sintered-glass funnel followed by washing with 200 ml. of cold (10\u00b0) ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0) gives 243 g.

The reaction mixture is maintained between \u221228\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 throughout the addition, which is terminated after 71 g. (1.0 mole) of chlorine has been added. After the addition, which takes approximately 1 hour, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0\u00b0 and 50 g. of powdered sodium carbonate is added, and the contents are shaken gently for several minutes. This treatment removes any hydrochloric acid which may have been produced during the reaction. The mixture is then filtered directly into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask containing 135 g. (0.951 mole) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. A condenser is fitted to the flask and the solution is heated at gentle reflux for 3 hours (Note 1). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (Note 2).

The pressure inside the equipment is reduced to 20 mm. A magnetic stirrer in the pyrolysis flask is started, the Diels-Alder adduct (Note 3) is added slowly to the hot flask, and the pyrolysate collected in the receiving flask. The distillation temperature during the pyrolysis varies from 135\u00b0 to 152\u00b0, depending on the rate of addition of the Diels-Alder adduct. After the addition is complete (about 1 hour), the pyrolysis is continued for a further 30 minutes or until very little material remains in the pyrolysis flask (Note 4). The crude pyrolysate is then redistilled at 12\u201315 mm., with all material boiling below 140\u00b0 collected; this distillate consists mainly of a mixture of dichlorocyclobutene and 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, the residue being mainly dimethylphthalate.\nA Final distillation at 55 mm. through a 36-in., platinum spinning band column yields 49\u201352 g.

            "A 500-ml., three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a two-necked adapter carrying a Friedrich condenser, and a thermometer which contacts the flask contents. The third neck of the flask carries a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel which is exchanged for a serum stopper as required. The condenser is attached to a suitable source of nitrogen. The reaction flask is placed in a heating mantle and charged with 7.75 g. (0.0767 mole) of diisopropylamine (Note 1), 3.68 g. (0.082 mole) of 54% sodium hydride in mineral oil (Note 2), and 75 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (Note 3). From the dropping funnel, 6.6 g. (0.075 mole) of isobutyric acid (Note 4) is added to the stirred mixture over 5 minutes. The internal temperature rises to 50\u201360\u00b0 and hydrogen evolution is completed by heating the mixture to reflux for 15 minutes. After cooling to 0\u00b0 with an externally applied ice\u2013salt bath (Note 5), 52 ml. of a standard solution of n-butyllithium in heptane (1.45 mmole/ml.; 0.075 mole) (Note 6) is added through the stopper by injection (Note 7) at a temperature below 10\u00b0. The ice bath is retained for 15 minutes before the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 30 minutes to complete the metalation. The resulting turbid solution is cooled, and 13.9 g. (0.0751 mole) of (2-bromoethyl)benzene (Note 8) is added from the dropping funnel over 20 minutes at 0\u00b0. A colorless precipitate of sodium bromide begins to separate almost immediately. The ice bath is retained for 30 minutes, after which the mixture is heated to 30\u201335\u00b0 for 1 hour.\nAt the conclusion of the reaction period, 100 ml. of water is added at a temperature below 15\u00b0 (Note 9). The aqueous layer is separated and the reaction flask and organic layer are washed with a mixture of 50 ml. of water and 75 ml. of diethyl ether. The aqueous layers are combined, back-extracted with 50 ml. of ether, and acidified to Congo red with 6 N hydrochloric acid. The product is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether, washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated. The remaining traces of solvent may be removed in a rotary evaporator, yielding 12\u201312.8 g. (83\u201390%) of crude 2,2-dimethyl-4-phenylbutyric acid, m.p. 89\u201394\u00b0, which is suitable for many purposes. Recrystallization from 75 ml. of hexane at room temperature followed by refrigeration yields 8.4\u20139.7 g. (58\u201367%) of product as colorless needles, m.p. 98\u201399.5\u00b0 (Note 10). Recrystallization of the filtrate residue from 20 ml. of hexane yields a small second crop, 1.2\u20131.6 g. (8\u201311%), m.p. 95\u201397\u00b0. The combined yield totals 10\u201311 g.

(1.00 mole) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde (b.p. 21\u00b0) is added from a hypodermic syringe dropwise and with stirring over a 15-minute period. During the initial phase of this addition a white solid separates but redissolves as the addition is continued. The resulting cold solution is stirred at \u221220\u00b0 for approximately 45 minutes, at which time a large amount of white solid separates and further stirring is impractical.

            "A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser equipped with a drying tube, and addition funnel provided with a pressure-equalizer arm is dried in a 100\u00b0 oven and assembled while warm. The warm apparatus is immediately purged with dry nitrogen, introducing the nitrogen at the top of the addition funnel. The flask is charged with 81 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium azide (Note 1) and 500 ml. of freshly distilled diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Note 2). A simple distillation apparatus is then dried in the oven and assembled while warm under a slow nitrogen purge. The distillation flask is charged with 112 g. of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 3), and after a forerun of approximately 2 g. the remaining material is distilled (b.p. 57\u201358\u00b0) directly into the addition funnel of the reaction flask. During this distillation it is convenient to disconnect the nitrogen stream from the top of the addition funnel and introduce it into the distillation flask. After the distillation is complete, the distillation apparatus is disconnected and the nitrogen stream is again introduced at the top of the addition funnel. The chlorotrimethylsilane (108.6 g., 1.000 mole) (Note 4) is then added rapidly to the sodium azide slurry, and this mixture is stirred at 70\u00b0 for 60 hours. During this period the nitrogen flow is terminated (Note 5).\nAfter the heating period is complete, the nitrogen stream is again initiated, and the mixture is cooled to 30\u00b0. The addition funnel and reflux condenser are replaced with two gas-inlet tubes with stopcocks. One inlet tube is connected to the nitrogen source and the other to a standard vacuum trap, of at least 150 ml. capacity. A vacuum (15\u201320 mm.) is applied to the trap after the latter is cooled to \u221278\u00b0, and the product is then distilled at 30\u00b0 (15 mm.) into the trap. Slight heating is necessary to maintain 30\u00b0, and rapid stirring should be continued throughout. Removal of volatile product is complete within 5 hours under these conditions. The entire system is then slowly pressurized to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen, and the product is redistilled through a 5-cm. Vigreux column. From 121 g. of crude flash distillate are obtained 4.0 g. of forerun and 98 g. (85%) of pure trimethylsilyl azide, b.p. 95\u201399\u00b0. During the distillation the pot temperature is maintained at 135\u2013140\u00b0 with a thermostated oil bath. The pot residue contains 19 g. of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether with traces of trimethylsilyl azide. The purity of the product cut as established by 1H NMR (CCl4) is 98%. A single peak at 13 cps. downfield from tetramethylsilane is observed, the only impurity being siloxane hydrolysis products. Chlorotrimethylsilane is conspicuous by its absence."

Under a static argon pressure of 2-3 cm. of Nujol, 80 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, and the resulting suspension is immersed in an acetone-dry ice bath at -78\u00b0. Through a cannula 132 ml. of an ethereal 1.04M (0.137 mole) solution of (E)-1-propenyllithium is transferred into the dropping funnel and added dropwise to the cold, stirred suspension of copper(I) iodide over 45-50 minutes.

Three drops of acetic acid are added at first, and stirring is continued at 0\u00b0 until the precipitation of white 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate begins. If necessary, crystallization is initiated by scratching with a glass rod or by addition of a seed crystal from a previous run. The remainder of the acetic acid is added over a 10-minute period, and stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at 0\u00b0.

The two platinum anodes of the electrode assembly (Note 1) are positioned in a horizontal plane ca. 1 cm above (Note 4) the mercury (cathode) surface.\nTo the cell are added diethyl fumarate (172 g, 1.0 mol) (Note 5), absolute ethanol (200 mL), and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (3.41 g, 0.1 mol) (Note 6). The mixture is allowed to stand for 0.5 hr to allow complete dissolution of the tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The cell is placed in a flowing-water bath in a hood.\nThe solution is electrolyzed with continuous magnetic stirring and nitrogen purging at a constant current (Note 7) until the theoretical quantity of electricity (1.0F \u2261 1e\u2212 per mole of diethyl fumarate) has been passed.

The flask is fitted with a 60-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel vented through a mineral oil bubbler and charged with a solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (24.6 g, 112 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (35 mL) . After the pyrrolidine solution is cooled to 0\u00b0C in ice, the colorless dicarbonate solution is added dropwise over a period of 30 min, and the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 3 hr (Note 2). The solvents are then removed under reduced pressure, and two consecutive Kugelrohr distillations of the residual oil (oven temperature 80\u00b0C at 0.2 mm) afford 16.6 g (87%) of N-Boc-pyrrolidine as a colorless oil (Note 3).",

An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a thermocouple (Note 4), is charged with (\u2212)-sparteine (30.2 mL, 131 mmol) (Note 5), N-Boc-pyrrolidine (15.0 g, 87.6 mmol), and anhydrous ether (900 mL) (Note 6). The solution is cooled to ~\u221270\u00b0C (dry ice/acetone bath) (Note 4). To this solution is added sec-butyllithium (96 mL, 1.16 M in cyclohexane, 111 mmol) (Note 7) and (Note 8) dropwise over a period of 35 min (Note 9). The reaction is then stirred at ~\u221270\u00b0C for 5.5 hr (Note 10).\nAfter this interval, a solution of benzophenone (25.5 g, 140 mmol) (Note 11) in anhydrous ether (200 mL) is added dropwise over a period of 1.25 hr (Note 9). The dark green to greenish-yellow suspension is maintained at \u221270\u00b0C for 2.0 hr, and the reaction is then quenched by dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid (8.5 mL, 150 mmol) over a period of 15 min. The resulting lemon-yellow suspension is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of 12 hr, during which time the mixture becomes cream colored.\nAfter the solution is warmed to 25\u00b0C, 5% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (150 mL) is added to the reaction mixture, and the resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 20 min. The layers are partitioned and the organic phase is washed with additional 5% H3PO4 (3 \u00d7 150 mL). Combined aqueous phases are extracted with ether (3 \u00d7 200 mL). The original organic phase and the ethereal extracts are combined, washed with brine (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure to afford crude product as an off-white solid.

A solid addition flask containing Oxone (180 g, 0.29 mol) is attached to the reaction vessel via a rubber tube (Note 2). An air condenser (20 cm length) loosely packed with glass wool is attached to the reaction vessel. The outlet of the air condenser is connected to a 75 \u00d7 350-mm Dewar condenser filled with dry ice-acetone that is connected to a receiving flask (100 mL) cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The receiving flask is also connected in series to a second dry ice-acetone cold trap, a trap containing a potassium iodide solution, and a drying tube. A gas inlet tube is connected to the reaction flask and a stream of nitrogen gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture (Note 3). The Oxone is added in portions (10\u201315 g) while the acetone-water mixture is simultaneously added dropwise (Note 4). The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously throughout the addition of reagents (ca. 30 min). A yellow solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone collects in the receiving flask. Vigorous stirring is continued for an additional 15 min while a slight vacuum (ca. 30 mm, water aspirator) is applied to the cold trap (Note 5). The yellow dioxirane solution (62\u201376 mL, (Note 6)) is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and stored in the freezer (\u221225\u00b0C) over Na2SO4. The dioxirane content of the solution is assayed using phenyl methyl sulfide and the GLC method ((Note 7) and (Note 8)). Generally concentrations in the range of 0.07\u20130.09 M are obtained.\nFigure 1",

The progress of the reaction is followed by GLC (Note 10), which analysis indicates that trans-stilbene is converted to the oxide in 6 hr (Note 11). Removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a white crystalline solid. The solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (30 mL) and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4.

An oven-dried, three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a Claisen adapter bearing a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet and rubber septum, and a thermometer. The flask is maintained under a static nitrogen pressure and charged with 5-methyl-5-hexen-2-one (24.20 g, 0.216 mol) (Note 2), trimethyl borate (60 mL) (Note 3), tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) (THF) (Note 4), and freshly activated 20-mesh zinc granules (16.96 g, 0.259 g-atom) (Note 5). The reaction flask is immersed in an oil bath at 25\u00b0C. Stirring is initiated and methyl bromoacetate (39.65 g, 0.259 mol) (Note 6) is added in a single portion through the septum. After an induction time (Note 7), a white precipitate starts to form and an increase of the internal temperature, up to reflux, is observed (Note 8). The mixture is stirred for 3 hr, after which time starting material is completely consumed (Note 9). The reaction is quenched by the sequential addition of glycerol (60 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (60 mL), then is transferred to a separatory funnel using 120 mL of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted again with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 60 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with aqueous 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (3 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to afford 37.32\u201338.92 g of crude \u03b2-hydroxy ester (93\u201397% yield) (Note 10).",
            "B. 3,6-Dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid. In a 500-mL flask, the crude ester prepared in Part A (37.00 g, 0.199 mol) is dissolved in a 2 N solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol (130 mL, 0.260 mol). The solution is stirred at 25\u00b0C and disappearance of the starting material is monitored by GLC (Note 9). After 5 hr saponification is complete and the methanol is evaporated at reduced pressure (Note 11). The residue is taken up with water (500 mL), extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 100 mL), and the organic phase is discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified (pH 2.5 on universal pH indicator paper) with ~6 N hydrochloric acid (about 60 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (5 \u00d7 100 mL). These latter ethereal extracts are washed with water (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride (2 \u00d7 30 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Evaporation at reduced pressure affords crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid as a viscous yellow oil that can be used in Part C without further purification. Evacuation at 0.5 mm at room temperature with internal magnetic stirring for 24 hr gives 28.07\u201329.40 g (82\u201386% yield) of a solvent-free material (Note 12) and (Note 13).",

The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. During this time, an exotherm is observed (up to 50\u00b0C) followed by a slow return to room temperature, and the suspension becomes thicker. The reaction is brought to reflux (in ca. 20 min) by means of a heating mantle and stirring is continued for another 3.5 hr. A two-necked, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser and magnetic stirrer is charged with crushed ice (400 g) and water (100 g), and the hot mixture is added carefully with good stirring. Light petroleum ether (500 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with light petroleum ether (4 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3 \u00d7 50 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (2 \u00d7 30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at ambient pressure to give the crude product as a dark oil. Final purification is achieved by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 15) affording 17.70\u201318.86 g (76\u201381% yield) of a 99% pure mixture (97:3) of the keto olefin isomers as a colorless oil, bp 84\u201385\u00b0C/26\u201328 mm (Note 16)."

After cooling the suspension to 0\u00b0C under nitrogen, a solution of 5.18 g (37.74 mmol) of (R)-phenylglycinol (Note 2) and 5.26 mL (37.74 mmol) of triethylamine (Et3N) in 25 mL of CHCl3 (Note 14) is added over 2 hr via an addition funnel (Note 15). After the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 hr at 25\u00b0C, CHCl3 (100 mL) and solid ammonium chloride (5 g) is added and the suspension is stirred for a further 0.5 hr (Note 16). The suspension is filtered and the residue is washed with CHCl3 (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The residue is put aside for suspension in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The resulting residue is purified by two recrystallizations from ethyl acetate/hexane (ca. 9:1) to give the amide 4 (combined yield 5.2 g, 61.0%). The mother liquor from the recrystallizations is chromatographed using silica gel (eluting with ethyl acetate/hexanes initially in a 1:1 ratio and increasing to 4:1, then 1:0) to give more amide 4 (0.6 g, 7.0%). The original solid residue, obtained from the filtration, is suspended in THF (200 mL); the slurry is stirred using a magnetic stirbar for 30 min. The product is filtered. The THF extraction of this residue is repeated (Note 17) and the filtrates are combined. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded additional amide 4, which was recrystallized as before (1.7 g, 20.0%). The overall yield of amide 4 is 5.9-7.5 g (11.9-14.9 mmol, 70-88%) (Note 18).",

From this point forward the light sensitivity of some compounds necessitates that certain flasks be wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two rubber septa, an internal thermometer, and 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar. Under a stream of argon (introduced through a septum with a syringe needle and balloon), lithium wire (0.53 g, 75.6 mmol, 4.5 equiv) (Note 14) is cut into (20-25) small pieces and washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 10 mL) to remove the protective oil. One septum is temporarily removed and a funnel is used to aid in the addition of the lithium pieces. The flask is then fitted with a gas adapter and evacuated (1.5 mmHg) for 10 min to ensure that all toluene is removed. The gas adapter is removed and naphthalene (10.12 g, 79.0 mmol, 4.7 equiv) (Note 15) is added with the aid of a funnel. The original septum is replaced and 50 mL of THF (Note 3) is added via syringe. The flask is sonicated for 1 h to facilitate dissolution of the lithium wire (Note 16), and the resulting dark green solution is left to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The lithium naphthalenide solution thus obtained is titrated according to a literature method3 and found to be 1.35-1.45 M (Note 17), and the flask is wrapped in foil.\nInto a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1) (4.37 g, 16.8 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon) is added 120 mL of THF via syringe (Note 3). The resulting silane solution is added to the lithium naphthalenide dropwise, over a minimum of 20 min, via cannula (Note 18). Once the addition is complete, the solution is cooled to -10 \u00b0C using an acetone bath with a small amount of dry ice.\nMeanwhile, a solution of anhydrous ZnCl2 (11.45 g, 84.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 19) in 70 mL of THF added via syringe (Notes 3 and 20) is prepared in a 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm stir bar and rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The ZnCl2 solution is added to the naphthalenide/silane mixture via cannula over a minimum of 20 min (Note 21). The acetone/dry ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 22).\nMeanwhile, a 1-L, three-necked, foil-wrapped, round-bottomed flask is charged with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 7.45 g, 41.9 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 23) and equipped with an internal thermometer, 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar and two rubber septa (one pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The flask is charged with 35 mL of THF via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C or colder using a dry ice/acetone bath. The room temperature silane solution is added into the cold NBS solution via cannula such that the internal temperature does not exceed \u221250 \u00b0C. After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is stirred for a further 30 min at -70 \u00b0C or colder. One septum is removed and the cold mixture is slowly poured into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 300-mL solution of rapidly stirring half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (Notes 7 and 24). The heterogeneous mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 mL of half-saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 (Note 25), 200 mL of water, 200 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (7 g) and quickly filtered through a thin pad of silica (Note 26) into a foil wrapped 500-mL single-necked flask. The yellow solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) and then at 1.5 mmHg for 1 h to give approximately 17 g of crude material (quantitative mass recovery based on both naphthalene and dibromosilole 2). 1H NMR analysis of a representative sample typically shows a 1:5.2 mixture of the dibromosilole (2) and naphthalene (Note 27), which corresponds to a 96% yield (6.78 g) of useable dibromosilole (2). It is generally unnecessary to remove the naphthalene for subsequent use, such as cross coupling reactions.\nIf necessary, the naphthalene can be removed by sublimation in small batches. Thus, 1.7 g of the naphthalene-silole mixture is ground into powder using a mortar and pestle, and sublimed in the dark, under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 3-4 hours at 35 \u00b0C (Note 28). This will typically remove 99% of the naphthalene according to 1H NMR analysis. If desired, further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the residual material from the combined sublimations in hot hexanes (160 mL) followed by cooling in a freezer for 16 h. The pure 2,5-dibromosilole crystallizes as white needles, which are vacuum-filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice cold hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 6.64 g (95% yield) of 2. (Note 29, 30 and 31). Dibromosilole 2 stored in the dark at room temperature is stable for several weeks. Even brief exposure to sunlight during processing will lead to significant decomposition (Notes 24 and 30)."

Mesitylene (20.9 mL, 18.03 g, 150 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 4) and cinnamyl alcohol (19.7 mL, 20.57 g, 153 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) are added via syringe (Note 6). The flask is then fitted with a rubber septum and placed on a magnetic stir plate. After stirring for 5 min, Pd(OAc)2 (0.067 g, 0.300 mmol, 0.002 equiv) (Note 7), and 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (0.190 g, 0.330 mmol, 0.0022 equiv) (Note 8) are added by temporarily removing the septum. Material adhering to the sides of the reaction flask is rinsed into the reaction mixture with 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, resulting in a clear, brown solution. Stirring is maintained and the reaction flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter fitted with a reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a thermocouple temperature probe adapter. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the system is placed in a heating mantle filled with sand (Note 9) and the thermocouple is inserted through the adapter. The solution is heated at 85 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for 7 h (Notes 10, 11). Heating and stirring are then interrupted, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (Notes 12, 13). After removing the nitrogen inlet and the water condenser, the reaction mixture is concentrated for 1 h by rotary evaporation (50 \u00b0C, 0.5 mmHg). The residue is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) and treated with activated charcoal (3.0 g) (Note 14). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 30 min and filtered in vacuo through a Celite pad (Note 15) in a B\u00fcchner funnel. The Celite is carefully washed with three 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate (Note 16) and the combined washings are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with aqueous HCl (2 M, 250 mL) (Note 17) and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 125 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with 200 mL of brine, then are retreated with charcoal (1.0 g) and MgSO4 (20 g) (Notes 18, 19), then are filtered through a second Celite pad in a B\u00fcchner funnel (Notes 15, 20), and concentrated under reduced pressure (45 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow solid (around 26 g, 95% yield) (Note 21) is dissolved in 80 mL of hot dichloromethane (35-38 \u00b0C), and about 140 mL of hexane (38 \u00b0C) is added until a light-yellow, homogeneous solution is obtained. The solution is cooled at \u221215 \u00b0C for 2 h and the resulting white crystals (21.8 g) are collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (45 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg) and the residue is dissolved in 20 mL of dichloromethane (35 \u00b0C), and 30 mL of hexane (35 \u00b0C). The solution is cooled at -15 \u00b0C overnight and a second crop of crystals is collected by suction filtration, and are washed with ice-cold hexane (20 mL). The two crops of crystals are combined and dried overnight at 0.1 mmHg to provide 23.2 g of cinnamyl-H-phosphinic acid (83%) as white crystals (Note 22)."

An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 200-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel (placed in the central neck of the flask and fitted with a rubber septum) and a 3.2 cm \u00d7 1.6 cm, egg shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with sodium borohydride (30.0 g, 0.793 mol, 2.4 equiv) (Note 1) and 500 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The resulting suspension is cooled in an ice bath and stirred rapidly. The pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a previously prepared solution of iodine (83.9 g, 0.331 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) in 150 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 2). The iodine-THF solution is added dropwise to the borohydride-THF suspension over 1.5 h (Note 4). Once addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted to the central neck of the flask. (S)-Phenylglycine (50.0 g, 0.331 mol) (Note 5) is then added to the mixture in small portions (Note 6). After the (S)-phenylglycine has been added, the ice-bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 18 h (Note 7). After this period, the solution removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-bath for 20 min, then 60 mL of methanol is very cautiously added (Note 8). After evolution of gas has ceased, the reaction mixture is diluted with 250 mL of anhydrous THF and triethylamine (48.6 mL, 35.3 g, 0.347 mol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 9) is added in one portion. With vigorous stirring, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (72.9 g, 0.334 mol, 1.01 equiv) is added portionwise (Note 10), followed by 200 mL of anhydrous THF (Note 11). The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 3 h. After this time, the solvents are removed in vacuo (Note 12) and the resulting white solid is suspended in 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 300 mL of water and stirred vigorously. The white residues are dispersed by the gradual addition of 400 mL of a 1:1 solution of 1.2 N aqueous HCl and brine. After being stirred for 20 min, the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel and is shaken with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are then shaken with a 1:1 solution of 0.6 N HCl and brine (200 mL), followed by a 1:1 solution of sat. aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine (200 mL), and finally, water (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (100 g), filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo (Note 12) to leave 100 mL of mother liquor. After addition of 300 mL of hexane, the solution is chilled at \u221220 \u00b0C for 12 h to induce precipitation. The mixture is then filtered through a 90 -mm B\u00fcchner funnel (fitted with 90-mm diameter Whatman 1 filter paper) to obtain crude tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate and the filtrate is kept. The crude product is purified by repeated recrystallization from dichloromethane-cyclohexane (3 crops) (Note 13) to afford 71.1 g (91%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate as white needles after drying in vacuo (Note 12). The clear filtrate kept from each recrystallization is combined, concentrated in vacuo (Note 12), and the resulting mixture (usually an off-white solid or a sticky cream foam) purified by column chromatography (Note 14) yielding a further 2.68 g (3.4%) of tert-butyl (1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylcarbamate after removal of solvents and drying in vacuo (Note 12).

Sodium Tetrakis[(3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (NaBArF24) (2).3\u20136 NaBArF24 can be conveniently prepared following the Inorganic Syntheses procedure.4b Although this procedure is reproducible, the additional details and the minor modifications described below are recommended.\nFollowing the procedure described in Inorganic Syntheses,4b a Grignard reaction employing Mg turnings (1.17 g, 48.1 mmol, 6.5 equiv), sodium tetrafluoroborate (813 mg, 7.40 mmol), 1,2-dibromoethane (0.57 mL, 1.25 g, 6.7 mmol, 0.9 equiv) and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene (7.15 mL, 12.16 g, 41.5 mmol, 5.6 equiv) (Note 1) is carried out in anhydrous ether (Note 2) under an argon atmosphere, The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 h to ensure the completion of reaction. After the workup and the subsequent processing of the reaction mixture as described ref 4b, the solvent is removed from the ether extracts using a rotary evaporator (20 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The resulting heavy, brown oil is dried by azeotropic distillation using a Dean-Stark trap and 200 mL of dry benzene (Note 3) under argon for two hours. Most (>190 mL) of the benzene is then removed by a continuously draining the solvent through the stopcock on the Dean-Stark trap (Note 4). After being cooled to room temperature, the remaining oily, brown mixture is triturated with dry benzene (50 mL) and the benzene layer is then decanted. The trituration is repeated twice more or until the resulting benzene layer is colorless (Note 5). The residual solvent is removed from the mixture with a rotary evaporator (ca. 40 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg). The remaining tan solid is further dried under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at room temperature for 8 h to afford a light tan powder (6.15 g, 94%) (Note 6). To further purify the product, the tan powder is transferred to a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel (60 mm \u00d7 100 mm (d \u00d7 h)) fitted with a Whatman 1 filter paper (55 mm) where it is washed with three, 30-mL portions of a cold (\u221240 \u00b0C) mixture of dichloromethane/hexane, 2:1 (Note 7) in a B\u00fcchner funnel to remove colored impurities. The solid is then dried under vacuum (90 \u00b0C, 0.1 mmHg) for 16 h and then is cooled to ambient temperature to afford 4.96 g (76%) of the sodium salt as a free-flowing, fine, white powder (Notes 8 and 9). Typically, the salt is stored at ambient temperature in a glove-box.",
            "B. Di(\u03bc-bromo)bis(\u03b7-allyl)nickel(II) (4).7,8 A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a Teflon-taped flow-controlled argon inlet, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar is flame-dried, purged with argon and transferred into a glove-box. The flask is then charged with bis[1,2:5,6-\u03b7-(1,5-cyclooctadiene)]nickel (1.38 g, 5.00 mmol) (Note 10) and is removed from the glove-box. Under argon from a Schlenk line, the flask is charged with anhydrous diethyl ether (80 mL) (Note 11) and is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/2-propanol bath, at which time allyl bromide (0.440 mL, 0.615 g, 5.08 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 12) is added via syringe with stirring. The cold bath is removed and replaced by a ice-water bath. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C gradually (ca. 15 min), then to ambient temperature over another 15 min by removing the cold bath (Note 13). The reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for another 30 min and then is transferred into the glove-box. The volatile contents of the flask are removed under high vacuum (ca. 0.1 mmHg) by connecting the flask to an evacuation port inside the glove-box (Note 14). The flask is rinsed with anhydrous ether (3 \u00d7 10 mL) and the resulting suspension is passed through a plug of dry Celite (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.5 cm (d \u00d7 h)) in a fritted glass filter funnel (2.5 cm \u00d7 18 cm, (d \u00d7 h) coarse) (Note 15). The Celite pad is washed with an additional 40 mL of ether. The ether washings are transferred into a 250-mL pear-shaped flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The ether is removed under vacuum (ca. 0.1 mmHg) with vigorous stirring to afford 0.803 g (89%) of the title compound as a dark-red powder, which was used without further purification (Note 16, 17).",
            "C. 2-Phenyl-1-butene (6). A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser (fitted with a nitrogen inlet), a rubber septum, and a magnetic stir bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with nitrogen. The flask is then charged with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (43.4 g, 121 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 18) through one neck of the flask under a strong flow of nitrogen and then quickly sealed with the rubber septum. Anhydrous THF (500 mL) (Note 19) is added into the flask through the rubber septum. The contents of the flask are then treated with n-BuLi (76.0 mL, 1.6 M solution in hexanes, 121 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 20) at ambient temperature and the mixture is stirred for 2 h. Propiophenone (13.4 mL, 101 mmol) (Note 21) is then added dropwise via syringe over a period of 15 min. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 8 h. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature and 400 mL of hexane/diethyl ether, 1:1 (Note 22) is added. The resulting suspension is filtered through a pad of Celite (ca. 15 g, 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm) in a fritted glass filter funnel [5.0 cm \u00d7 12 cm, (d \u00d7 h) coarse] which is washed with 100 mL of hexane/diethyl ether, 1:1 (Note 23). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The resulting pale-yellow slurry is first taken up in dichloromethane (30 mL) and then is triturated with hexane (200 mL) and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The remaining slurry is treated in the same manner twice more (Note 24). The combined extracts are filtered through a silica plug (ca. 20 g, 3 cm long, 5 cm in diameter), which is washed with 50 mL of hexane. The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (15 \u00b0C, ca. 20 mmHg). The light-yellow liquid residue is purified by column chromatography (Note 25) to afford 11.9 g (88%) of the 6 as a clear colorless liquid (Note 26).",
            "D. (R)-3-Methyl-3-phenylpentene (7).2 The pre-catalyst is prepared as follows in a glove-box: A 100-mL, pear-shaped Schlenk flask with one side-arm fitted with a rubber septum and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated, flame-dried, and purged with argon. The flask is charged with anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 27) and is transferred into a glove-box (Note 28). To the flask is quickly added [di(\u03bc-bromo)bis(\u03b7-allyl)nickel(II) (180 mg, 0.50 mmol, 0.01 equiv), (R)-2,2'-binaphthoyl-(S,S)-di(1-phenylethyl)aminoylphosphine (539 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) (Note 29) and NaBArF24 (886 mg, 1.00 mmol, 0.02 equiv) in the order mentioned. The resulting suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h to afford a dark-brown solution containing a small amount of fine particles (NaBr).\nA 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a Teflon-taped flow-controlled argon inlet, a thermometer, and a magnetic stir bar is flame-dried and purged with argon. The flask is then charged with 150 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (Note 27). The catalyst solution prepared above, now removed from the drybox, is introduced to the vessel via cannula. The flask containing the catalyst solution is further rinsed with 10 mL of dichloromethane, and this solution is also transferred to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of pre-catalyst transfer, the system closed at the flow-controlled stopcock and then is cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C in a dry ice/acetone bath, creating a small vacuum. A strong flow of dry ethylene (Note 30) is introduced through a needle through the serum stopper to relieve the vacuum and then is adjusted to maintain a pressure of 1 atm by releasing excess gas through an oil bubbler. The introduction of the ethylene causes the internal temperature to rise. Within ca. 5 min, the internal temperature increases by 5 \u00b0C and the ethylene line is removed (Note 31). The solution is cooled back to \u221270 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring. A solution of 2-phenyl-1-butene (6) (6.60 g, 50.0 mmol) in 30 mL of dry dichloromethane (Note 27) is introduced as a weak stream into the solution of pre-catalyst over a two-minute period via syringe followed by a 10 mL rinse with dichloromethane. Ethylene is introduced again through a needle, first as a strong flow and then regulated to maintain a pressure of 1 atm. Under an ethylene atmosphere, the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is then maintained between \u221265 \u00b0C and \u221270 \u00b0C for a period of 4 h. At the end of this period the ethylene line is removed and the reaction mixture is slowly poured into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 mL of pentane (Note 32) is and combined with a 50-mL pentane rinse of the reaction vessel. After being warmed to ambient temperature, the resulting, cloudy solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (Merck, grade 9385, mesh 230-400, 60 \u00c5, 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm, (d \u00d7 h)), which is eluted with 100 mL of pentane (Note 33). The combined eluates are concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 \u00b0C, 20 mmHg) to afford 7.99 g (99.7%) of (R)-3-methyl-3-phenylpentene (er 98.8:1.2) as a clear, liquid (Notes 34 and 35)."

In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (fitted with an 8-cm Teflon paddle), a Teflon-coated thermocouple, and a 150-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a solution of (4S)-4-isopropyl-5,5-diphenyloxazolidin-2-one (DIOZ) (Note 1) (22.5 g, 80 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (266 mL) (Note 2) is cooled to \u221240 \u00b0C using an ethanol/dry ice bath. n-Butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane, 52.75 mL, 84.8 mmol, 1.06 equiv) (Note 3) is added to the well-stirred suspension (Note 4). The resulting reddish solution is allowed to warm to \u221215 \u00b0C (ca 15 min) and is then cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C. A solution of 3-phenylpropanoyl chloride (14.84 g, 87.97 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 5) in THF (42.5 mL) is added via the addition funnel to the solution while the temperature is kept between \u221270 and \u221260 \u00b0C. Addition is completed after 20 min and stirring is continued for 30 min further (Note 6). The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, quenched with half-saturated aq. NH4Cl solution (210 mL) and then is transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel where it is extracted twice with EtOAc (160 mL, 25 mL). The combined organic phases are washed consecutively with water (105 mL), sat. aq. NaHCO3 solution (21 mL), and half-saturated brine (105 mL). After being dried over MgSO4 (8 g, 30 min), the organic phase is filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, then the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) and then is dried at 0.2 mmHg for 8 h at room temperature. The crude product (35 g) is dissolved in refluxing tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) (105 mL) and hexane (215 mL) is added slowly over 20 min. At the end of the addition, precipitation occurs. The mixture is then cooled in an ice bath for 2 h and is filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel to obtain the pure product, which is dried (23 \u00b0C at 0.08 mmHg) for 4 h to obtain 29.6 g (89%) of 1 as colorless needles (Note 7).",

The clear, colorless solution is cooled to \u221250 \u00b0C (ethanol/dry ice bath). A solution of TiCl4 in dichloromethane (1 M, 73.5 mL, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 10) is added dropwise via cannula keeping the temperature between -50 and \u221240 \u00b0C (Note 11). Then a 1 M solution of triethylamine in dichloromethane is added via syringe (ca. 3 mL) until the dark red color of the enolate persists (Note 12). More triethylamine (10.19 mL, 7.4 g, 73 mmol, 1.05 equiv) in dichloromethane (70 mL) is slowly added over 10 min keeping the temperature between \u221240 and \u221235 \u00b0C. After stirring the reaction mixture for 20 min further at this temperature, a solution of benzyl isopropoxymethyl carbamate (16.4 g, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 eq) (Note 13) in dichloromethane (80 mL) is added over 10 min via the addition funnel, followed by one more equivalent of the 1 M TiCl4 solution in dichloromethane (73.5 mL, 73.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) via cannula keeping the temperature at \u221240 \u00b0C (Note 10). After 10 min, the cooling bath is replaced by an ice bath and the reaction mixture stirred for 3 h at 0\u20132 \u00b0C (Note 6). The yellow reaction mixture is quenched with a solution of sat. aq.

The combined organic layers are washed with half-saturated brine, dried over MgSO4 (15 g, 30 min), filtered through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) and dried in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 0.08 mmHg) for 5 h to afford the crude product as a pale-yellow foam (42.7 g) (Note 14). The residue is dissolved, with stirring, in 250 mL of refluxing tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME). During the addition of hexane (150 mL) some seed crystals were added (Note 15, 16). The mixture is allowed to cool for 30 min and then is heated back to reflux. Another portion of hexane (100 mL) is added and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting crystals are collected by suction filtration through an 8-cm medium-porosity glass filter funnel, then are washed with two 100-mL portions of a mixture of ice-cold hexane/TBME, 2:1. After a second recrystallization from hexane/TBME, 1:1 (250 mL each), the isolated crystals are dried in vacuo (23 \u00b0C, 0.15 mmHg) for 8 h at room temperature to provide 21.05 g (52%) of the product 2 as colorless, diastereomerically pure microcrystals (Notes 17, 18).",

            "Although many convenient and reliable precursors of benzyne have been prepared and utilized in organic synthesis,2 a hypervalent iodine-containing molecule, (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2) , has been developed for service as an efficient and mild benzyne precursor. The major developments over the past years have been the improvement of methods of synthesis of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor and the applications to related reactive intermediates. The summary will be reported in this Discussion Addendum.\nImprovement of Hypervalent Iodine Precursor\n2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2 generates benzyne more efficiently than other benzyne precursors such as benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate, o-dihalobenzenes (1,2-bromofluorobenzene and 1,2-dibromobenzene), and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate. The efficiency of this benzyne precursor 2 is attributable to the high leaving group ability of hypervalent iodine groups, which has been discussed previously.3 Hypervalent iodine benzyne precursor 2 was prepared in two steps from inexpensive and commercially available 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Initial preparation of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) by reaction of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Me3SiCl in the presence of Mg and a catalytic amount of I2 in HMPA is followed by transformation into 2 by the reaction with PhI(OAc)2 activated with TfOH in CH2Cl2. However, several drawbacks remained: (1) use of toxic HMPA solvent and severe conditions for the preparation of 1, (2) difficulty for introduction of functional groups, and (3) low solubility of the hypervalent iodine species in most organic solvents.\nTo improve the reaction procedure, an alternative benzyne precursor, 2-(hydroxydimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate (5), has been prepared in three steps starting with 1,2-dibromobenzene.4 This process avoids the use of carcinogenic HMPA and severe reaction conditions (high temperature and long reaction time). The reaction of 5 with Bu4NF under mild conditions generates benzyne efficiently, which provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. Therefore, 5 is a convenient alternative benzyne precursor. Incorporation of synthetically important carbonyl groups into hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors is difficult, because carbonyl groups cannot tolerate Grignard conditions. Synthesis of benzyne precursors bearing the carbonyl groups has been accomplished using pyran-2-ones as starting materials. Reaction of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with methyl 2-pyrone-5-carboxylate or 5-acylpyran-2-ones at 200 \u00b0C in a sealed tube affords the corresponding methyl 3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzoate5 or 1-acyl-3,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-benzenes6 in good to high yields, which can be converted to 2-(trimethylsilyl)-phenyliodonium triflates 6, which contain carbonyl groups, by treatment with PhI(OAc)2 and TfOH. Treatment of 6 with Bu4NF in CH2Cl2 generates benzynes that contain ketone functionality, and reaction with furan provides the benzyne adducts in high yields. In general, hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors are stable solids and easy to handle, but they do not dissolve in most organic solvents. To improve the solubility of the hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, long-chained precursors (7) have been synthesized.7 As the alkyl chain of benzyne precursors 7 is lengthened, the solubility in non-polar organic solvents and the yield of the benzyne adduct with furan gradually increases.\nFigure 1.Improvements of synthetic procedures for hypervalent iodine precursors.\n1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) is the key starting material for the synthesis of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyliodonium triflate 2. Recent improvement on the synthesis of 1 have been reported in which 1,2-dibromobenzene is used instead of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The use of Rieke magnesium or Mg turnings/1,2-dibromoethane8 and Fe-catalyzed DIBAL-H activated Grignard reaction have led to improved reactions.9 Through these variations, severe reaction conditions and the use of toxic HMPA solvent can be avoided.\nFigure 2. Improvements of synthesis of 1.\nOther Applications Using Hypervalent Iodine\nWhen hypervalent iodine and silyl groups are contiguous, fluoride ion can trigger the concerted elimination reaction of these two groups. This method is applicable not only to the generation of benzyne, but also to the generation of reactive intermediates related to benzyne. Thus, 2,3-didehydronaphthalene (8),10 bicycle[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-yne (9),11 dehydro-o-carborene (10),12 2,3-didehydrothiphene (11),13 and 2,3-didehydropyrrole (12)14 have been generated by this method. Benzobisoxadisiloles have been applied to synthesis of hypervalent iodine benzyne precursors, which can serve as the synthetic equivalents of 1,4-benzdiyne (13) and related species.15\nFigure 3.

            "A. 4-[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-ethylamino]-3-nitrobenzoic acid ethyl ester (3). A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm) (Note 1).The flask is charged with ethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate 1 (5.00 g, 21.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) and anhydrous DMSO (20 mL) (Note 3). To this homogeneous yellow mixture, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine 2 (4.04 mL, 23.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise over 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. As soon has the first drop is added, the reaction mixture quickly changes to a dark reddish-orange color, but the mixture remains homogeneous throughout the addition without detectable exotherm. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (5.31 mL, 30.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise (1-2 min), which results in a slight cloudiness, but no exotherm is detected during or after addition. The flask is closed with a septum (Note 6) and the reaction mixture is stirred in an oil bath heated to 70 \u00b0C. During the warming process, the dark reddish-orange color lightens somewhat, but the mixture remains cloudy. The reaction is stirred for 18 h at 70 \u00b0C after which time the dark reddish-orange reaction mixture is homogeneous. The reaction is judged to be complete by the disappearance of the starting ester by TLC (Note 7). The mixture is cooled to room temperature (Note 8) and de-ionized water (2 mL) is added dropwise with a Pasteur pipette over a period of ca. 2-3 min with efficient stirring while a persistent cloudiness develops. Precipitation/crystallization of the product occurs rapidly after the addition, giving rise to a very thick dark-red suspension (Note 1). After formation of the suspension, water (150 mL) is added in 10 mL portions over a period of ca. 5 min. During the addition of water the mixture becomes slightly warm to the touch. The resulting dark-orange to dark-yellow suspension of product is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h. The solids are collected by suction-filtration on filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with four portions of water (20 - 30 mL each). The solids are allowed to dry for ca. 1-2 h under air suction on the filter funnel. The solids are then collected and placed under vacuum (2 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 7.92-7.98 g (97-98% yield) of a red-orange to dark yellow solid (Note 10) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "B. Ethyl 3-amino-4-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)benzoate (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm). The flask is charged with nitro compound 3 (7.00 g, 18.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and methanol (285 mL) (Note 12). The flask is then fitted with a 3-way gas inlet adapter with an argon-filled balloon attached to one of the arms. While stirring the resultant yellow suspension, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). While stirring under a blanket atmosphere of argon, the adapter on the flask is briefly removed and Pearlman's catalyst (500 mg, (Note 14)) is added as a suspension in methanol (10 mL + 5 mL rinse). The argon balloon is then replaced with another balloon filled with hydrogen gas and, while stirring the mixture, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with hydrogen gas three times (Note 13). The dark yellow-black suspension is allowed to stir under the hydrogen atmosphere for a period of 24 h, after which TLC analysis indicate the disappearance of compound 3 (Note 15). The hydrogen balloon is once again replaced with an argon-filled balloon and the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times (Note 13). The 3-way stopper is then removed, Celite 545(r) (10g) (Note 16) is added and the suspension stirred under the argon blanket for 10 min. The solid is removed by suction filtration over filter paper (Note 17) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel and the solids are washed with two portions of methanol (20 - 30 mL each). The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 \u00b0C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid (Note 18) which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.",
            "C. 2-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-1-[2-(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)- ethyl]-1 H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6). A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 19), DMF (30 mL) (Note 20) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 \u00b0C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) (Note 21) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 \u00b0C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4 (Note 11). The stirred mixture (Note 22) is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) (Note 23) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid (Note 25). The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper (Note 9) using a ceramic B\u00fcchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) (Note 26) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid (Notes (Note 24) and (Note 27)). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper (Note 28) and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 29). The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid (Note 30)."

            "Reductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful methodology primarily because its products are excellent substrates for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Since 2003, the Organic Syntheses article and the primary references have been cited over 100 times. This discussion addendum aims to provide a brief overview of recent developments in this methodology. Improvements and variations of \u03b1-acetoxy ether formation, as well as the synthetic utility of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers will be discussed. Recent applications in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products are also included.\nImprovements and Variations of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ether Formation\nThe original reductive acetylation protocol involves the addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBALH) as a 1.0 M solution in hexanes to the ester at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting aluminum alkoxide is then treated with pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) sequentially. The internal temperature during these additions should not exceed -72 \u00b0C in order to maximize the yield and prevent undesired side reactions.2 While this method is general, recent developments include the use of asymmetric electrophiles in order to generate more complex acyl ethers and the extension of reductive acetylation to lactams and imides.\nShortly after the original article, Rovis and Zhang reported the use of acid fluorides as competent reagents for the trapping of such aluminum alkoxides, the results of which are summarized in Figure 1.3 Aryl, vinyl, and alkyl acid fluorides are all effective trapping reagents (67-97% yield) and steric bulk is well tolerated (pivaloyl fluoride = 92% yield). This development allows access to more complex acyl acetal derivatives without sacrificing a full equivalent of the acid, which represents an improvement in atom economy over the use of symmetric anhydrides.\nFigure 1. Acid Fluorides as Trapping Reagents.\nMore recently, Dalla and co-workers have extended reductive acetylation strategy to the formation of \u03b1-acetoxy pyrrolidines (Figure 2).4 While DIBALH will reduce imides, the resultant aluminum alkoxide is not nucleophilic enough to react with acetic anhydride. Therefore, the reductant of choice for the preparation of \u03b1-acetoxy amines is lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH), whose lithium alkoxide is sufficiently nucleophilic for effective trapping with acetic anhydride.\nFigure 2. Formation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Pyrrolidines.\nA variety of N-alkylated imides, shown in Figure 3, afford \u03b1-acetoxy lactams in high yields (75-100%), with the notable exception of cases where there is \u03b1-branching with respect to the nitrogen substituent (e.g. the imide of \u03b1-methylbenzylamine, MeBn). Steric bulk on the imide also limits the conversion to the \u03b1-acetoxy lactams, as shown by the modest yield for the bis-OTBS imide. Despite these limitations, this reductive acetylation strategy offers rapid entry into N-acylimium ions for use in Mannich reactions.\nFigure 3. \u03b1-Acetoxy Lactams from Imides.\nSynthetic Utility of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nTreatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers with a Lewis acid (commonly BF3\u00b7OEt2, MgBr2\u00b7OEt2, TMSOTf, SnCl4 or TiCl4) results in the formation of an oxocarbenium ion, which can be intercepted by a variety of nucleophiles to afford a new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond adjacent to an ether linkage. The scope of such transformations has been investigated in the context of diastereoselective nucleophilic additions. \u03b1-Acetoxy ethers are also useful substrates for cascade sequences, such as oxonia Cope-Prins and Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclizations. The use of \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet Spengler reactions have also been examined.\nThe use of \u03b1-(trimethylsilyl)benzyl alcohol as a chiral auxiliary has been investigated by Rychnovsky and Crossrow for diastereoselective additions to oxocarbenium ions generated from \u03b1-acetoxy ethers.5 This chiral auxiliary was chosen due to the ease of preparation of both enantiomers and facile deprotection or conversion to the benzyl ether. Treatment of the \u03b1-acetoxy ether with a variety of nucleophiles, including allyl silanes, silyl enol ethers, and silyl ketene acetals, in the presence of TMSOTf proceed in high yields (87-98%) and high diastereoselectivities (20:1 to 80:1), as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, (E)-crotyltrimethylsilane affords the syn product in high yield and diastereoselectivity (82%, 27:2.4:1). The addition of cyanide and ethyl nucleophiles proceed in high yields (97% and 75% respectively), albeit with modest diastereoselectivity (5:1 and 4:1).\nFigure 4. Diastereoselective Additions of Nucleophiles.\nRychnovsky and Dalgard have reported on the expedient synthesis of tetrahydropyranones through an oxonia Cope-Prins cyclization.6 This strategy, outlined in Figure 5, involves a reductive acetylation of an ester 1, followed by treatment with TMSOTf to generate oxocarbenium ion 3. The pendant allyl moiety participates in a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to generate oxocarbenium ion 4, which is poised for a Prins cyclization (intramolecular Mukaiyama aldol reaction) with the silyl enol ether to afford tetrahydropyranone 5. This transformation is effective for a variety of substrates (Figure 6) affording the tetrahydropyranone product in high yields (77-99%), including those bearing quaternary centers adjacent to the ketone.\nFigure 5. 2-Oxonia Cope-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 6. Synthesis of Tetrahydropyranones.\nRovis and Epstein have also utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers in a cascade sequence to provide 4-amino tetrahydropyrans through a Sakurai-Prins-Ritter cyclization.7 As shown in Figure 7, treatment of 4-acetoxy-1,3-dioxane 6 with TMSOTf generates oxocarbenium ion 7, which upon treatment with allyl silane affords alkene 8. In the presence of TfOH, acetal cleavage results in formation of oxocarbenium ion 9, which undergoes a Prins cyclization to give carbocation 10. Addition of a nitrile to the carbocation affords 4-amino tetrahydropyran 11 after hydrolysis.\nFigure 7. Sakurai-Ritter-Prins Cyclization.\nFigure 8. Synthesis of 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nThe Sakurai-Ritter-Prins reaction is effective for a variety of dioxane derivatives, as shown in Figure 8. This transformation affords the 4-amino tetrahydropyran products in good yields (59-88%) and high diastereoselectivies (90:10 to 99:1). It should be noted that 2-substituted allyl silanes (Figure 9) and a variety of nitriles are effective partners in this transformation.7\nFigure 9. Synthesis of Quaternary 4-Amino Tetrahydropyrans.\nJacobsen and Doyle have utilized \u03b1-acetoxy ethers as substrates in the development of enantioselective organocatalytic oxa-Pictet-Spengler reactions (Figure 10).8 An ester derivative of tryptophol was reduced and trapped to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 12. In the presence of a thiourea catalyst 13, TMSCl, and BaO, oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent ring closure afforded tetrahydropyrano-indole 14 in good yield (82%) and good enantiomeric excess (79%).\nFigure 10. Organocatalytic Asymmetric Oxa-Pictet-Spengler Cyclization.\nHighlighted Applications in the Total Synthesis of Complex Natural Products: Intramolecular Allylation of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers\nKadota, Yamamoto and co-workers utilized reductive acetylation to unite two complex fragments in their highly convergent synthesis of marine neurotoxin gambierol (19).9 The strategy, shown in Scheme 1, begins with the coupling of ABC acid to FGH alcohol via Yamaguchi esterification. The resulting ester 15 is then subjected to reductive acetylation conditions. While\nScheme 1. Kadota and Yamamoto's Total Synthesis of Gambierol.\nAc2O is an effective trapping reagent, chloroacetic anhydride provided increased yield and proper diastereoselectivity for the subsequent ring closure. Treatment of the resulting \u03b1-acetoxy ether 16 with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves afforded effective closure of the 6-membered D ring in high yield (87%) and modest diastereoselectivity (2:1) with respect to the acyclic ether. The resulting diene 17 is primed for a ring closing metathesis to forge the 7-membered E ring. The complex polycyclic ether framework 18 was then further elaborated to gambierol (19).\nScheme 2. Kadota's Total Synthesis of Brevenal.\nA similar approach was employed in Kadota and co-worker's total synthesis of the nontoxic brevetoxin antagonist brevenal (23).10 As shown in Scheme 2, the 7-membered D ring arose from the reductive chloroacetylation of ester 20, followed by treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 21 with magnesium bromide etherate and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieves. The resulting oxocarbenium ion was then trapped by the allyl stannane to afford the tetracycle 22 in good yield as a single diastereomer (52% from the ester 20). This cyclization again sets the stage for a ring closing metathesis sequence to afford a pentacycle, which was elaborated to brevenal (23).\nThe authors also reported a second-generation strategy (Scheme 3) where acyclic a0cid 24 is coupled to ABC alcohol 25.10-b This route employs the same reduction/cyclization sequence to forge the E ring in good yield as the single desired diastereomer (57% from the ester 26) and sets up the closure of the D ring in an analogous fashion.\nScheme 3. Kadota's Second Generation Strategy to Brevenal.\nRecently, the total synthesis of ciguatoxin CTX3C (34) by Yamashita and co-workers employed reductive acetylation to facilitate a radical cyclization to give the C ring of tridecacyclic natural product (Scheme 4).11 The AB acid and E alcohol were subjected to Yamaguchi esterification conditions to afford the ester 29. Following reductive acetylation, \u03b1-acetoxy ether 30 underwent transacetylation in the presence of diisobutylaluminum phenylselenide to afford the \u03b1-seleno ether 31 in high yield (83% from the ester). The \u03b1-seleno ether 31 was carried through 3 steps before C-ring radical cyclization was initiated by triethylborane and oxygen in the presence of tributyltin hydride to provide sulfoxide 33 in good yield as a single diastereomer (86%). This approach offered increased stereoselectivity over a direct allylation strategy (as in gamberiol). Sulfoxide 33 was then carried forward to afford ciguatoxin CTX3C (34).\nReductive acetylation has proven to be a powerful method for the construction of complex cyclic ethers via intramolecular allylation. The strategy has played a key role in the preparation of brevetoxin-like ladder polyethers.12 The method's utility is largely due to the ease with which substrates can be brought together by a Yamaguchi esterification. This protocol allows for a highly convergent and flexible approach to these marine natural products.\nScheme 4. Yamashita's Total Synthesis of Ciguatoxin CTX3C.\nIntermolecular Couplings of \u03b1-Acetoxy Ethers and Silyl Enol Ethers\nCrimmins and DeBaillie utilized reductive acetylation to install the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety of the tetrahydropyran fragment of the marine cytotoxin bistramide A (38).13 The synthetic strategy is outlined in Scheme 5. The lactone 35 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (7:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 36 with (E)-3-penten-2-one in the presence of excess TMSOTf led to formation of tetrahydropyran 37, a key building block for the synthesis of bistramide A (38), in high yield (87%) and good diastereoselectivity (9:1).\nScheme 5. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Bistramide A.\nRychnovsky and co-workers used a related strategy to construct the western tetrahydropyran fragment of marine cytotoxin leucascandrolide A (43).14 As shown in Scheme 6, the lactone 39 was reduced with DIBALH followed by trapping with Ac2O to give the \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 in high yield (91%) and high diastereoselectivity (15:1). Treatment of \u03b1-acetoxy ether 40 with silyl enol ether 41 in the presence of catalytic zinc bromide led to formation of tetrahydropyran 42 in high yield (92%) and good diastereoselectivity (20:1). Tetrahydropyran 42 was then further elaborated to leucascandrolide A (43).\nScheme 6. Rychnovsky's Total Synthesis of Leuscandrolide A.\nThe most complex example of such intermolecular couplings comes from Crimmins and co-workers recent synthesis of the cancer cell growth inhibitor (+)-irciniastatin A (48).15 This convergent strategy is outlined in Scheme 7. Reduction of lactone 44 followed by trapping with Ac2O proceeds to give \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 in quantitative yield. Treatment of the sterically hindered \u03b1-acetoxy ether 45 with boron trifluoride etherate followed by a slight excess of the highly functionalized silyl enol ether 46 gave tetrahydropyran 47 in good yield (59%; 85% based on recovered ketone) and high diastereoselectivity (>20:1). Tetrahydropyran 47 was then carried forward to afford (+)-irciniastatin A (48).\nScheme 7. Crimmins' Total Synthesis of Irciniastatin A.\nReductive acetylation followed by intermolecular coupling has proven to be a useful strategy for coupling complex fragments in total synthesis.16 The success of this methodology is largely due to the functional group compatibility of the reduction and mild conditions for oxocarbenium ion formation. Furthermore, the coupling itself often proceeds in high yield and high diastereoselectivity. These features validate this method as a highly convergent process in complex natural product synthesis."

The flask is charged through the septum (via syringe) with anhydrous CH2Cl2 (150 mL) (Note 10) and immersed in a previously cooled dry ice/acetone bath at -78 \u00baC (internal temperature) (Note 11). Then, DIBAL-H (45 mL, 45.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe over a 15 min period (Note 12), resulting in a pale orange solution. The reaction progress is followed by TLC analysis (Note 13) or GC analysis (Note 14). After 2 h reaction time, additional DIBAL-H (20.4 mL, 20.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe; after stirring for an additional 1 h, no more starting material is observed by TLC analysis (Note 15). The flask is removed from the cooled bath, and the reaction is then quenched by slow addition of ethyl acetate (150 mL) (Note 16) and 2M HCl (100 mL) (Note 17) over a 10 min period. The organic phase is separated using a 1-L separatory funnel and the aqueous solution is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate (8 g) and concentrated by rotary evaporation (from 760 mmHg to 26 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 18). The title compound is thus obtained as a yellow oil (8.00-8.09 g, 69-70% yield) (Note 19).",

            "The olefin metathesis reaction has emerged as a widely used transformation in organic chemistry and materials science.4 In keeping with the theme of our original article, this discussion addendum provides an overview of current large-scale ring-closing metathesis (RCM) applications of the Ru-based family of metathesis catalysts, the structures of which are shown in Figure 1.5\nFigure 1. Commonly Used Olefin Metathesis Catalysts.\nIn our 2003 report for the preparation of N-Boc-3-pyrroline , we utilized 0.5 mol% of catalyst 1 in a refluxing (2.5 h) 0.4 M solution of N-Boc-diallylamine in CH2Cl2. The report also described an extractive method for removing Ru-derived catalytic species/impurities using the water-soluble P(CH2OH)3, readily prepared from a commercially available fire-retardant aqueous formulation of P(CH2OH)4Cl. Following Kugelrohr distillation, this method reliably provided ca. 30 g of crystalline N-Boc-3-pyrroline in 90-94% isolated yield. Concurrent with the development of our procedure, Helmchen reported6 a 100 g preparation of Boc-3-pyrroline using 0.1 mol% of ethylidene 2a in a room-temperature (15 h) 0.57 M CH2Cl2 solution of N-Boc-diallylamine. Catalyst deactivation or removal procedures were not taken and the product was isolated in 98% yield after vacuum distillation. This transformation has also been reported to proceed in 87% yield when run neat and with catalyst 5 loading as low as 500 ppm.7\nSince the time of our report, however, RCM has rapidly matured and has been used to prepare kilogram quantities of structurally complex macrocyclic synthetic intermediates within the pharmaceutical industry. Optimizing a large-scale RCM process requires that several conditions be studied, namely, substrate type and functional group compatibility, catalyst selection, and solvent/temperature/time requirements. In many applications, removal of residual ruthenium is also a concern. In this Discussion Addendum, large-scale industrial RCM processes will be used to frame the relevant issues. These examples include Boehringer-Ingelheim's Hepatitis C protease inhibitor BILN-2061, GlaxoSmithKline's cathepsin \u039a inhibitor SB-462795, and RCM-tethered macrocyclic peptides. The discussion will conclude with an overview of developments in the area of ruthenium removal.\nFigure 2. SB-462795 and BILN-2061 and their RCM disconnections.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the 2006 and 2009 RCM processes for construction of the BILN-2061 peptide macrocycle.\nBoehringer-Ingelheim's 2006 disclosure8,9,10,11,12,13 of a large-scale RCM approach to the hepatitis C viral protease inhibitor BILN-2061 provides an interesting case study for those contemplating a large-scale metathesis process. The BILN-2061 metathesis substrate is an unnatural tripeptide-derived diene, which closes to a (Z)-olefin-containing 15-membered ring. Two of the conformation-restraining amide bonds are endocyclic, and two additional macrocyclic torsional degrees of freedom are fixed by the presence of the five-membered proline ring and an endocyclic trans-cyclopropane. The optimized 2006 RCM process (Figure 3) was scaled up to produce >400 kg of cyclized product.10 Three years later, the BI group reported a higher-yielding and order-of-magnitude greener procedure, one which dramatically reduced the amount of time, solvent, and catalyst loading.13\nThe first efforts to construct the BILN-2061 macrocycle used catalyst 1.9 These trials were met with problematic epimerization at the \u03b2-carbon of the vinylcyclopropyl amino acid residue (Figure 4). When a mono-phosphine catalyst such as 3 was used, the epimerization reaction was not observed. Analysis of model systems revealed that the rearrangement was facile when the bis-phosphine catalyst 1 was used. The rearrangement could also be promoted by adding one equivalent of phosphine to a mixture of catalyst 3 and the model system (Figure 4). The origin of this rearrangement was suggested to occur via the intermediacy of bis-phosphino or amino phosphino ruthenacyclopentene intermediates.9,11 Further studies revealed that the site of catalyst initiation in the macrocycle precursor depended upon the substitution of the aminocylopropylcarboxylic acid nitrogen atom: acyl-type substituents such as N-Boc shifted the initiation to the rearrangement-stable nonenoic residue (Figure 4).12 Before this detail was known, the reasonably efficient 2006 process using diene 7 and catalyst 3 was plagued by problematic batch inconsistencies. Traces of morpholine (<20 ppm) in the toluene solvent were shown to be responsible for substrate isomerization and catalyst inhibition, with the former arising from bis-ligated Ru species of the type discussed earlier. These problems were alleviated by acid-washing the solvent prior to the metathesis reaction.\nFigure 4. Catalyst-specific epimerization observed in RCM reactions of BILN-2061 substrates, suggested ruthenacyclopentene intermediates, and the effect of N-Boc substitution on site of catalyst initiation.\nThe aminocyclopropyl metathesis rearrangement encountered by the BI group was unexpected and highly substrate-specific. The most common side reactions in metathesis processes are alkene isomerization reactions.14 Because of the reversible nature of olefin metathesis, isomerization can alter unreacted starting material or products. It can be problematic in reactions where the catalyst is stressed by temperature or time or in some product purifications involving direct distillation from Ru-containing pot residues.15 For example, ring closure of diallyl ether 19 to 20 with catalyst 4 (Figure 5) is a rapid reaction, but significant product isomerization to vinyl ether 21 can occur at extended reaction times. Rearrangement is thought to arise from Ru-H species; it can be suppressed by solvent selection16,17 or by additives such as tricyclohexylphosphine oxide,18 acetic acid or 1,4-benzoquinones,19 phenylphosphoric acid,20 chlorocatechol borane,21 or Cy2BCl.22\nFigure 5. Select rearrangements observed in Ru-catalyzed metathesis reactions.\nRearrangement chemistry is the desired outcome in some applications. For example, Ru-catalyzed rearrangements are used for selective O-allyl23 and N-allyl24 deprotections. The latter, an allylamine to enamine transformation, was observed in lactam-piperidone 22 when treated with catalyst 1 in refluxing toluene (Figure 5). Olefin migration can also occur in hydrocarbon chains. For example, attempts to ring-close cyclopentanone-derived diene 25 with catalyst 4 did not return the [9.5.0] ring system.25 Instead, the monosubstituted double bond was found to migrate at a rate faster than 9- or 8-membered ring closure, leading to exclusive generation of the [7.5.0] product 26. Another strategy purposefully adds a hydride source to promote rearrangement after ring closure. For example, enol ether 28 is formed in 82% yield by first performing an RCM reaction on diene 27 to form the seven-membered ring product, which is then isomerized in a second step involving addition of NaBH4 to the Ru-containing reaction mixture.26\nNon-metathesis side reactions have also been reported in the context of Ru-promoted metathesis reactions. Hoye and Zhao have reported fragmentation reactions in RCM substrates containing secondary allylic alcohols; in sluggish metathesis reactions these systems can fragment to the methyl ketone.27 Kharasch additions of CHCl3 to olefins, as catalyzed by 1 at 65 \u00b0C, are also known.28\nAlthough the problem of isomerization was largely solved and the RCM reaction was utilized at kg scale, the 2006 BILN-2061 process suffered from several other drawbacks. The first of these was the dilute substrate concentration (0.014 M), which required excessive solvent consumption. A study of the macrocyclization behavior of different acyclic dienes and dimeric intermediates revealed a 27-fold improvement in the effective molarity (EM) of cyclization, which translated to a 0.2 M RCM process.12 A significant shortening of the reaction time was also realized. As mentioned earlier, an N-Boc group at the vinylcyclopropane amide residue was found to productively shift the site of catalyst initiation and led to a more facile and robust ring-closing reaction. While adding protection-deprotection steps, the improved 2009 process could therefore be run at higher concentrations and temperatures and with lower catalyst loadings (0.1 mol% 6 vs. 3 mol% 3). Each of these factors contributed in a positive manner to the EM of cyclization. Although the details will not be considered here, one of the principle steps in optimizing the BILN-2061 macrocyclization was defining conditions which (i) minimized formation of dimeric compounds arising from acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) processes,29,30 and (ii) one in which these oligomers could be equilibrated to product.\nThe BILN-2061 RCM reaction optimization is best viewed in terms of green chemistry considerations. The 2009 process13 represented a significant savings in terms of time, energy, and material. The RCM step was reduced to minutes instead of hours. Scrupulous degassing and solvent purification was necessary for the 2006 process, whereas the new process only required a brief degassing boil-out. The 2006 RCM process required as much as 150,000 L solvent per metric ton of diene, whereas the 2009 process reduced this amount to 7,500 L/MT. Because catalyst loading was greatly reduced in the 2009 process, Ru removal was likewise less resource-intensive. The 2006 process used excess 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (2 kg/1 kg diene) and aqueous bicarbonate to remove a portion of the soluble ruthenium, with subsequent silica gel and charcoal filtrations necessary to reduce Ru levels to 10 ppm in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In contrast, the 2009 process used 50-fold less 2-mercaptonicotinic acid and did not utilize silica or charcoal filtrations. The Sheldon E-factor,31 which is the ratio of waste mass to product mass, improved to 52 (computed for the 2009 Boc protection/RCM/Boc deprotection process) from 370 (computed for the 2006 RCM process).\nLarge-scale RCM was also used in GlaxoSmithKline's 2009 synthesis of the seven-membered azapane ring in cathepsin K inhibitor SB-462795 (Figure 6).32 The metathesis step in this synthesis also required multiple optimization attempts. Initial efforts using diene 29 and catalyst 5 were stymied by the need for high catalyst loadings (5-10 mol%). Substrate-catalyst coordination was suspected to be the source of the problem, but reactions using Ti(O-iPr)4 as a chelation inhibitor33,34 were not successful due to substrate/product decomposition. Additionally, large residual Ru levels were deemed a safety hazard with downstream steps involving H2O2 (for chiral auxiliary removal) and an acyl azide (for nitrogen insertion via Curtius rearrangement). To complicate matters, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone RCM product 30 decomposed via a retro-aldol reaction when the basic P(CH2OH)3/NaOH ruthenium removal procedure was employed. These setbacks led to the design of N/O-protected RCM precursor 31. This substrate closed with lower catalyst loadings (1-2 mol%) but gave capricious levels of olefin migration when attempted with crude product coming out of a Curtius rearrangement employing hydrazine and t-butyl nitrite/HCl (Figure 6). Solvent swaps or isomerization inhibitors (acetic acid, styrene, or Cy3PO) did not suppress the isomerization. The RCM process was made tractable by purifying precursor diene 31 as the HCl salt. When converted to the free base, it reliably provided 32 as a crystalline product in 90% yield using 1-2 mol% of catalyst 5. A basic cysteine wash was used to remove Ru; this thiol-based approach was utilized after it was discovered that (i) formaldehyde, generated during in situ generation of P(CH2OH)3, added to the carbamate nitrogen of product 32 to form hydroxymethylated 35, and (ii) residual P reagents proved problematic for subsequent olefin hydrogenation.\nFigure 6. Selected RCM reactions used in the synthesis of SB-462795.\nAn alternative route to SB-462795 employed RCM precursor 36 containing a phthalimide-protected trans-1,2-aminoalcohol moiety. In comparison with diene 31, this substrate offered a significant improvement in the RCM process, although here again significant optimization efforts were directed at identifying and minimizing trace impurity catalyst inhibitors.35 Highly purified material could be closed in quantitative yields with as little as 0.25-0.5 mol% catalyst 5. Olefin migration was not observed, even in reactions using crude material. When conducted in toluene, the product readily crystallized and provided material with low residual Ru content after the slurry was washed with P(CH2OH)3/NaHCO3.36 According to the published account, both approaches were amenable to large-scale manufacturing and the trans-1,2-aminoalcohol route was used to provide over 200 kg of SB-462795.\nOther publicly disclosed pharmaceutical applications of RCM involve its use to conformationally constrain37,38,39 and alter the metabolic profile of helical peptides by forming peptide macrocycles.40 Scale-up aspects of this chemistry remain proprietary, but much of the exploratory work has been on solid support,41 with microwave-assisted RCM macrocyclizations.42,43 Many examples undergo efficient RCM reactions, and in a solution-phase study of minimal RCM constraints in 310-helical peptides, it was found that high E-selectivity could be realized in an unoptimized 18-membered macrocyclization (38\u219239, Figure 7) catalyzed by 5-7 mol% 4 in refluxing dichloromethane.44\nFigure 7. Representative helical peptide macrocyclization and work-up procedures.\nThe reactions shown in Figure 7 highlight two additional methods for post-RCM reaction processing: (i) the use of ethyl vinyl ether as a Ru catalyst poison (by formation of the stable Fischer carbene) prior to evaporation and silica gel chromatography (SGC), and (ii) a Ru removal procedure utilizing the commercially available, albeit expensive, tris(hydroxymethyl)-phosphine.15,45\nThe BI and GSK investigations show that large-scale RCM reactions can require significant optimization. It is expected that these paths will shorten as more applications are reported. These two examples reveal that at-scale process applications can utilize as little as 0.1-0.5 mol % Ru catalyst, which minimizes the waste stream and is in accord with sustainable green chemistry practice. Sustainable concepts in olefin metathesis have been reviewed elsewhere.46 Pharmaceutical applications require that the API contain <10 ppm metal, and the two industrial examples discussed here utilized water-solubilizing procedures using 2-mercaptonicotinic acid,13 cysteine,32 or tris(hydroxy-methyl)phosphine.36 Downstream processes such as hydrogenation over charcoal-based catalysts can also be used to reduce Ru levels to <1 ppm.35 Other approaches to remove Ru include amine-functionalized mesoporous silicates,47 polar isocyanides,48 lead tetraacetate,49 activated carbon/silica gel,50 and DMSO or triphenylphosphine oxide treatment of crude reaction mixtures.51 DMSO/DMF mixtures have been used to remove colored Ru impurities in solid-phase RCM applications.52 A recent report describes the use of 15% aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an efficient Ru removal agent; this process also oxidizes residual phosphine and carbene ligands to more polar entities, thus easing purification in some cases.53"

            "2,4-Dichloroquinoline (1). A 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask was equipped with a teflon-coated, oval-shaped stir bar (41 \u00d7 17 mm) and charged with malonic acid (26.0 g, 250 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 1)).2 A rubber septum was connected to one of the side necks and a condenser is attached to the middle neck. That condenser was equipped with a line that runs to an HCl trap ((Note 2)). The flask was lowered into an ice water bath and POCl3 (100 mL) was poured into the open neck. The open neck was sealed with a rubber septum. A slight flow of nitrogen gas was introduced into the system through a needle (16 gauge) inserted into one of the side neck septa (Note 3). Stirring was initiated at 300 rpm. Aniline (22.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) was added slowly to the stirring mixture by syringe through a side neck septum over a period of 20 min (Note 4). The flask was then removed from the ice water bath, allowed to stir for 10 min, placed into an oil bath (~110 \u00b0C). and the mixture was stirred for 6 h (Note 5). The flask was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool for 5 min without stirring (Note 6). The mixture was slowly and carefully poured onto crushed ice (~ 1 L) in a 2 L beaker while intermittently stirring with a spatula. The residual material in the 3-neck round-bottomed flask was removed by carefully adding water (100 mL) to the flask and scraping out with a spatula. The aqueous mixture was triturated by vigorous stirring with the spatula (Note 7). The 2 L quench beaker was placed into a bucket of ice. Aqueous NaOH (6 M, 475 mL) was added slowly (over a period of 25 min, maintaining the temperature \u2264 50 \u00b0C) while intermittently stirring (Note 8). The beaker was removed from the ice bath and the suspension was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and age with stirring (77 \u00d7 13 mm stir bar, ~100 rpm) for 12 h (Note 9). The pH of the supernatant was ~7. The suspension was then vacuum filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (12.5 cm diameter). Water (150 mL) was used to rinse the residual material from the beaker. The filtered orange-red solid was rinsed with water (150 mL) on the filter. After thoroughly air-drying on the filter (> 1 h), the solid was transferred into 2 cellulose thimbles (43 mm \u00d7 123 mm, int. diam. x ext. length). The contents of each thimble were subjected to a Soxhlet extraction with hexaness (300 mL, (Note 10)) for 16 h. The combined extracts were concentrated (Note 10) by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to leave a yellow solid (13.9\u201314.6 g, 28\u201329%, Notes (Note 11) and (Note 12)) that was used in step B without further purification (Note 13).",

A 100 mL, round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a teflon-coated oval stir bar (32 \u00d7 15 mm), rubber septum and an inlet needle connected to an argon/vacuum manifold (Note 16) was first charged with (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1.63 g, 14.3 mmol, 1 equiv, Notes (Note 17) and (Note 18)). Then, Pd(dba)2 (164 mg, 285 \u03bcmol, 0.02 equiv), rac-BINAP (356 mg, 572 \u03bcmol, 0.04 equiv), 2,4-dichloroquinoline (1) (5.66 g, 28.6 mmol, 2 equiv) and sodium tert-butoxide (4.12 g, 42.9 mmol, 3 equiv, (Note 19)) were added. The reaction vessel was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times, then left under a positive pressure of argon.3 Toluene (35 mL) was dispensed into the flask, and the resulting red-brown solution was placed into an oil bath heated to 80 \u00b0C with stirring (Notes (Note 20) and (Note 21), Caution: possible exotherm!). The reaction was monitored by TLC (Note 22); after 1.5 h, nearly complete conversion was observed. The reaction was cooled to 25 \u00b0C, and saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added to the flask. The suspension was stirred for 5 min and cooled to 0 \u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (9 cm diameter) and washed with water (50 mL) and hexaness (150 mL) to afford a light yellow solid. This crude solid was transferred to a pre-weighed 100 mL round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 joint and dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for at least 10 h to leave 4.57-4.80 g of a light beige-yellow solid (73-77%) (Note 23), which was used in step C without further purification.",

A 10-20 mL microwave vial equipped with an oval stir bar (12 \u00d7 8 mm) was charged with H,4ClQuin-BAM (2) (4.30 g, 9.83 mmol, 1 equiv, (Note 24)), pyrrolidine (3.23 mL, 39.3 mmol, 4 equiv) and trifluorotoluene (3.3 mL) (Note 25). The vial was sealed, and this suspension was heated with stirring in the microwave at 170 \u00b0C for 3 min, then at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min (Notes (Note 26) and (Note 27), Caution: exothermic!). The reaction mixture was diluted and transferred with 20 mL of dichloromethane to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask for evaporation (Note 28). The reaction was then concentrated by rotary evaporation (80 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg), redissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel, and washed with aqueous NaOH (3 M, 50 mL) and water (4 \u00d7 50 mL). The resulting organic layer was dispensed into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried (MgSO4, 2 g). The solution was filtered (flask and filter were rinsed with an extra 25 mL of dichloromethane) into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mm Hg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h) to provide a light brown powder (Note 29).\nAs much of the material as possible was transferred as a solid from the round-bottomed flask to a pre-weighed 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The remaining solid was dissolved and transferred into a 25-mL pear-shaped flask with 10 mL of dichloromethane and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 13 mmHg) and high vacuum (0.2 mmHg, 1 h). This material was then added to the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The material was dissolved in a 90:10 mixture of acetone and toluene (20 mL/g crude product) with heating in a water bath (70 \u00b0C) (Note 30). The solution was removed from heat and placed on the bench for 1 hour to cool to room temperature. The flask was placed in an ice bath for 3 h or until no further crystallization was observed. The mother liquor was carefully decanted, leaving crystals that were washed with ice-cold acetone (2 \u00d7 10 mL). Residual solvent was removed from the crystals by placing the flask under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) for a period of 5-10 min (Note 31). The crystalline material was transferred to a pre-weighed 20 mL glass scintillation vial and dried for ~14 h in a drying pistol (0.21 mmHg) over refluxing toluene. The vial was temporarily removed from the drying pistol, and the material was thoroughly pulverized with a spatula and returned to the drying pistol for an 6 additional 6 h. The dried material was a white cream colored powder (3.08-3.54 g, 62-71% yield) (Notes (Note 32) and (Note 33))."

The apparatus is placed under high vacuum (< 1 mmHg) and allowed to cool to room temperature and subsequently maintained under a positive pressure of N2 using needle inlet through the septum on the rightmost neck. Upon cooling, a thermometer is attached to the center neck using a Teflon adapter, and the apparatus is again evacuated under high vacuum. It is then placed under a positive pressure of N2 and charged with 40.0 mL of toluene (Note 1), then cooled in a -15 \u00b0C acetone bath (Note 2).

            "Nugent's morpholinoisoborneol (MIB) is an excellent ligand for the catalytic asymmetric addition of alkyl, vinyl, and aryl groups to aldehydes in the presence of organozinc reagents to furnish a variety of secondary alcohols with high ee.3,4,5 The major developments have been the significant broadening of the substrate scope and the development of several one-pot methods that streamline the synthesis of synthetically valuable and versatile molecules such as epoxy alcohols, allylic epoxy alcohols, cyclopropyl alcohols, halocyclopropyl alcohols, pyranones and 1,2,4-trioxanes with high enantio-, diastereo-, and chemoselectivity.6,7,8 In this update, we will summarize many of the advances.\nA detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of (-)-MIB has been published in Organic Syntheses.9 Starting from either (R)- or (S)-camphor, gram quantities of either enantiomer of MIB can be synthesized in three steps and with only a single purification step. At the time of this report, only (-)-MIB is commercially available.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Arylation of Aldehydes\nTwo routes for the catalytic asymmetric arylation of aldehydes to generate highly enantioenriched diarylmethanols and benzylic alcohols were reported (Figure 1).10 In the first route, diarylzinc intermediates were generated in situ by metalation of unfunctionalized aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by transmetalation with ZnCl2 (Figure 1A). The LiCl formed in the process catalyzes a rapid racemic background reaction. The Lewis acidic LiCl was selectively suppressed by addition of tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB and aldehyde to the preformed diarylzinc reagent gave addition products with high enantioselectivities (80-92%) and yields (78-99%). In the second route, mixed alkyl aryl zinc reagents were generated by metalation of aryl bromides with n-BuLi followed by addition to ZnCl2 and subsequent addition of a second equivalent of n-BuLi. The mixed organozinc species was used in situ in the asymmetric addition reaction after addition of 0.8 equivalents of TEEDA (Figure 1B). Higher enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were achieved via this route. This methodology was extended to the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl- and diheteroarylmethanols with high levels of enantioselectivity.11\nFigure 1. Catalytic asymmetric aryl additions to aldehydes with (A) Ar2Zn and (B) ArZnBu from aryl bromides.\nCharette and coworkers introduced a complementary catalytic asymmetric arylation method by developing a salt-free preparation of diorganozinc reagents using Zn(OMe)2 and alkyl/aryl Grignard reagents (Figure 2).12 The insoluble salts Mg(OMe)2 and/or NaBr salts were removed by centrifugation or filtration to afford the salt-free diorganozinc reagents. Two examples highlighting the efficiency of this chemistry are illustrated in Figure 2. Ishihara and coworkers adopted Charette's method to synthesize salt-free i-Pr2Zn and subsequently added it to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB with up to 94% ee.13,14\nFigure 2. Charette's catalytic asymmetric (A) alkyl and (B) aryl additions.\n2. Synthesis of Chiral Acyclic Epoxy Alcohols\nIn an effort to streamline the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of valuable small molecules,6 the (-)-MIB-based organozinc catalyzed carbonyl addition step was merged with several other transformations such as epoxidation, cyclopropanation, halocyclopropanation, and various rearrangement reactions. The first tandem reaction developed was for the synthesis of chiral epoxy alcohols.\nFigure 3. Three one-pot synthesis of epoxy alcohols.\nTwo complementary methods were developed for one-pot synthesis of highly enantio- and diastereoenriched epoxy alcohols with up to three contiguous stereocenters.15,16,17 The first route involved highly enantioselective alkyl additions to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes followed by titanium-catalyzed diastereoselective epoxidation with either dioxygen or TBHP (Figure 3A). The second route involves highly enantioselective divinylzinc additions to aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes (Figure 3B). The vinylzinc reagents can be either isolated and purified prior to addition to aldehydes,18,19 or formed in situ by hydroboration of a terminal alkyne followed by transmetalation to zinc (Figure 3C).20 The latter method provided access to a synthetically challenging class of secondary trans-disubstituted epoxy alcohols with up to 4.5 : 1 dr. Excellent enantioselectivities were obtained with a wide range of aldehyde substitution patterns, except unbranched aldehydes, which undergo additions with up to 85% ee. This alkoxide-based titanium epoxidation catalyst is unique in that the same catalyst demonstrated high diastereoselectivity with allylic alkoxides exhibiting either A1,2 or A1,3 allylic strain in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states.\nSynthesis of Chiral Allylic Epoxy Alcohols\nAsymmetric vinylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of MIB generated unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide intermediates. In situ alkoxide directed epoxidation afforded densely functionalized allylic epoxy alcohols in good yields and excellent chemo-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity (Figure 4).16 The vinylzinc reagents may be either prepared and purified (Figure 4A) or generated in situ using Oppolzer's procedure.20\nFigure 4. Synthesis of allylic epoxy alcohols using (A) purified vinylzinc reagents, or (B) in situ generated vinylzinc reagents.\nThe latter procedure afforded only (E)-disubstituted vinylzinc reagents whereas the former allowed for more substituted vinylzinc reagents. The enal must bear non-hydrogen substituents in the R2 or R3 position so that either A1,2 or A1,3 strain is present in one of the diastereomeric epoxidation transition states. The unsymmetrical bis(allylic) alkoxide then underwent a highly chemoselective directed epoxidation of the more electron-rich double bond while minimizing A1,2 or A1,3 strain.\nCatalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes\nThe vinylation procedures above provide (E)-allylic alcohols. Walsh and coworkers developed catalytic asymmetric (Z)-vinylation of aldehydes with (Z)-vinylzinc reagents via a novel 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence.21,22 Thus, hydroboration of 1-halo-1-alkynes followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium,23 transmetalation of the resulting (Z)-vinylboranes to zinc and addition to prochiral aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB and the diamine inhibitor TEEDA furnished (Z)-disubstituted allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity and without contamination by (E)-allylic alcohols (Scheme 1). This transformation is analogous to a net trans hydroboration of the corresponding alkynes. Aliphatic aldehydes with \u03b1-branching gave products of high enantiopurity whereas \u03b2-branched aldehydes gave lower enantioselectivities.\nScheme 1. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (Z)-allylic alcohols.\n4.1 Tandem Catalytic Asymmetric (Z)-Vinylation of Aldehydes/Diastereoselective Epoxidation and Cyclopropanation\nThe generation and addition of (Z)-vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes were then applied to two one-pot tandem reactions. In the first tandem reaction, the resulting allylic alkoxides were treated with Et2Zn, TBHP, and Ti(Oi-Pr)4 to perform the diastereoselective and/or chemoselective epoxidation to synthesize epoxy alcohols and (Z)-allylic epoxy alcohols (Figure 5A).21 In the second tandem reaction, the allylic alkoxides were subjected to 5 equiv each of CF3CH2OH, Et2Zn, and CH2I2 to provide highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols (Figure 5B).24 A variety of 1-chloro-1-alkynes and aldehydes (saturated, aromatic, and heteroaromatic) were employed successfully in these tandem reactions.\nFigure 5. Tandem syntheses of (A) epoxy and allylic epoxy alcohols and (B) syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols.\n4.2 Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis (Z)-Trisubstituted Allylic Alcohols\nThe (Z)-vinyl zinc reagents generated were all disubstituted because the 1,2-metalate rearrangement was executed with a hydride source. A variant of the 1,2-metalate rearrangement/transmetalation sequence for the stereospecific generation of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents was also developed.25 Hydroboration of 1-bromo-1-hexyne with either diethyl- or dicyclohexylborane followed by 3 equiv of diethylzinc provided the (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents. The dialkylzinc served a two-fold function: it induced a 1,2-metalate shift to form the new C-C bond and promoted the boron to zinc transmetallation. In the presence of TMEDA (to inhibit the zinc halide by-product) and catalytic amounts of (-)-MIB, these reagents were then employed in the catalytic asymmetric addition of (Z)-trisubstituted vinyl zinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish enantioenriched (Z)-trisubsituted allylic alcohols in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, this procedure could not be adapted to the highly enantioselective synthesis of \u03b1-methyl-substituted allylic alcohols despite screening several additives (ee <30%, 15-50% yield).\nScheme 2. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1-ethyl and \u03b1-cyclohexyl (Z)-trisubstituted allylic alcohols.\nTandem Catalytic Asymmetric Addition/Diastereoselective Cyclopropanation\n5.1. Synthesis of syn-Cyclopropyl Alcohols. Two tandem routes have been developed to synthesize highly enantio- and diastereoenriched syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.26 The first route involved enantioselective alkyl addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of (-)-MIB (Figure 6A) whereas the second route involved addition of vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes to furnish the allylic alkoxide intermediates (Figure 6B). After removal of the volatile materials, the intermediate allylic alkoxide was exposed to either EtZnCH2I or the more reactive CF3CH2OZnCH2I27 to furnish syn-cyclopropyl alcohols with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The first route has a broader substrate scope, but is more challenging because unsaturated aldehydes isomerize readily. The second route provides only (E)-disubstituted syn-cyclopropyl alcohols.\nFigure 6. Tandem asymmetric A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation and B) vinylation of aldehydes followed by diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.2. Synthesis of Enantioenriched Dienols and syn-Vinylcyclopropanes\nThe catalytic enantioselective vinylation was extended to addition of dienyl groups to aldehydes in the presence of 10 mol % (-)-MIB.24 The requisite dienyl zinc intermediates were synthesized via chemo- and regioselective hydroboration of enynes followed by transmetallation with diethylzinc. Dienols were obtained in 79-93% yield and 76-94% ee (Figure 7A).\nThis methodology was further extended to the synthesis of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The dienylzinc alkoxide intermediates were subjected to EtZnCH2I to provide vinyl cyclopropanes with high chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Figure 7B). The alkoxide directed cyclopropanation of allylic C=C bonds is faster than remote C=C bonds.28 A limitation of this method is that aromatic aldehydes were unsuccessful coupling partners.\nFigure 7. Asymmetric dienylation and diastereoselective cyclopropanation.\n5.3. Synthesis of anti-Cyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe inherent bias for syn-selectivity in the alkoxide directed cyclopropanation could be switched to synthesize anti-cyclopropyl alcohols using a strategy developed by Charette and coworkers29 wherein allylic alcohols were protected with bulky silyl groups to prevent coordination to zinc carbenoids. In our method for the synthesis of anti-cyclopropanes,19 we silylated the intermediate zinc alkoxide in situ with TMSCl/Et3N and then subjected the silyl ether to cyclopropanation conditions. The cyclopropyl zinc alkoxides were desilylated in situ to furnish anti-cyclopropyl alcohols in 60-82% yield with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3). The Et3N is likely necessary to break up the zinc aggregates, rendering the zinc alkoxides more nucleophilic towards TMSCl.\nScheme 3. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of anti-cyclopropyl alcohols.\n5.4. Synthesis of syn-Halocyclopropyl Alcohols\nThe catalytic enantio- and diastereoselective tandem generation of cyclopropyl alcohols was extended to the synthesis of halo-substituted cyclopropyl alcohols.26,30 The enantioenriched zinc alkoxide intermediate was subjected to Et2Zn, CF3CH2OH, and either iodoform, bromoform or dichlorobromomethane to furnish iodo-, bromo- or chlorocyclopropyl alcohols respectively in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity (Figure 8A). In these one-pot tandem halocyclopropanation reactions, four consecutive stereogenic centers are established with excellent diastereoselectivity starting from simple achiral \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde precursors. Interrogation of the cyclopropyl stereochemistry via 1H NMR and X-ray analyses led to an interesting find; when R4 = alkyl or H, the halo group was cis to the carbinol, whereas when R4 = Ph, the halo group was trans. This switch in stereochemical bias was rationalized by invoking a zinc-phenyl-p interaction.31\nA complementary approach to iodocyclopropyl alcohols was developed using MIB-catalyzed asymmetric vinyl addition as the first step followed by subjection of the zinc alkoxide intermediate to 3 equiv of Zn(CHI2)2 (Figure 8B).30 The iodocyclopropyl alcohols can be further allylated with allyl/methallyl bromide in the presence of LiCu(n-Bu)2 to furnish 1,2,3-disubstituted cyclopropanes in good yields as single diastereomers with full retention of the cyclopropane stereochemistry (not shown).\nFigure 8. Tandem asymmetric (A) alkyl addition to enals followed by diastereoselective halocyclopropanations and (B) vinyl addition to aldehydes followed by diastereoselective iodocyclopropanation.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Aminovinylation of Aldehydes: Synthesis of \u03b2-Hydroxyenamines, \u03b2-Aminoalcohols, and syn-Aminocyclopropyl Alcohols\nRegioselective hydroboration of ynamides followed by boron to zinc transmetallation and subsequent addition to aldehydes in the presence of 5 mol % (-)-MIB furnished \u03b2-hydroxyenamines in moderate yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee, Figure 9A).32\nA tandem catalytic asymmetric aminovinylation/diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction was developed to synthesize syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols with excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1) in moderate yields (Figure 9B).32\nFigure 9. A) Synthesis of \u03b2-hydroxyenamines and B) tandem synthesis of syn-aminocyclopropyl alcohols.\nCatalytic Asymmetric Ethoxyvinylation of Aldehydes\nHighly enantioselective addition of ethoxyvinyl zinc reagents, generated via hydroboration of ethoxyacetylene followed by in situ transmetalation to zinc and addition to aldehydes in presence of MIB afforded hydroxyenol ethers with high ee (89-95%) and yields (>93%, Scheme 4).33 Subsequent hydrolysis generated two carbon homologated enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes. In the case of addition to chiral \u03b2-hydroxy aldehydes, mismatched and matched catalyst-substrate combinations can be used to achieve moderate to good diastereoselectivities of either the syn- (up to 3.8:1 with (-)-MIB) or anti-diols (>9:1 with (+)-MIB).\nScheme 4. One-pot tandem catalytic asymmetric ethoxyvinylation of aldehydes.\nOther uses of MIB in Organic Synthesis\n8.1. Synthesis of \u03b3Unsaturated \u03b2-Amino Acid Derivatives\nA catalytic enantioselective synthesis of \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives was achieved in three steps from trityl protected 1-butyne-3-ol.34 The enantioenriched allylic alcohols were transformed into the corresponding allylic amines via a [3,3]-sigmatropic trichloroacetimidate rearrangement, and led to \u03b3-unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives with high ee after a one-pot deprotection-oxidation sequence (Scheme 5). Similar [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions were executed to access enantioenriched allylic amines en route to the syntheses of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (Figure 10).35,36\nScheme 5. Asymmetric synthesis of \u03b3unsaturated \u03b2-amino acid derivatives via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\nFigure 10. [3,3]-Sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reactions en route to the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D.\n8.2. Synthesis of Di(allyl) Ether Derivatives\nNelson and coworkers added Et2Zn to conjugated enals in the presence of MIB followed by O-allylation of the enantioenriched zinc alkoxides to provide di(allyl) ethers in good yields (73-87%) and high ee (88-98%).37,38,39 Subsequent olefin isomerization and Claisen rearrangement provided access to a variety of enantio- and diastereoenriched Claisen adducts (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6. Asymmetric synthesis of di(allyl) derivatives.\n8.3. One-pot Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyranones\nEnantioenriched pyranones with >90% ee were prepared via a one-pot tandem asymmetric alkylation of 2-furfurals in the presence of catalytic (-)-MIB followed by oxidation with NBS (Scheme 7).40\nScheme 7. One-pot tandem asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched pyranones.\n8.4. Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched 1,2,4- Trioxanes\nEnantioenriched allylic alcohols can be subjected to a hydroxyl directed regio- and diastereoselective photooxygenation reaction with O2 in the presence of tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) to obtain allylic hydroperoxides in >10:1 dr, with the threo-isomer as the major product (Scheme 8).41 The allylic hydroperoxides were further reacted with cyclic ketones in the presence of catalytic p-TsOH to yield enantioenriched 1,2,4-trioxanes (16-78% yield) that exhibited antimalarial activity.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of enantioenriched \u03b2-hydroperoxy alcohols and 1,2,4-trioxanes.\n8.5. Polystyrene-supported MIB-derived Ligands\nPericas and coworkers have successfully synthesized and immobilized 3-exopiperazinoisoborneol (PIB), a close analog of MIB, to Merrifield resins (Scheme 9).42 Polystyrene-supported PIB possessed high catalytic activity and improved chemical stability, and was employed as a ligand (10 mol %) in the asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes with Et2Zn in batch methods to produce highly enantioenriched alcohols in good yields (50-92% y, 92-99% ee). This method is amenable to continuous flow methods for over 30 h with high conversion and no erosion in enantioselectivity. In this fashion, industrial scale amounts (13.0 g) of enantiopure alcohol were isolated in a single continuous flow operation leading to >30 fold better performance compared to batch conditions (TON = 251 with respect to the product).\nScheme 9. Synthesis of polystyrene-supported PIB\n8.6. MIB in Syntheses of Natural Products\nOver the years, MIB has been employed in the synthesis of a number of natural products. In all of these syntheses, MIB has been primarily used in asymmetric alkylation or vinylation reactions to provide diastereo- and enantioenriched alcohols.35,36,41,43,44 In their formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A, Hong and coworkers employed (-)-MIB in the diastereoselective vinylation of a chiral aldehyde to furnish the requisite allylic alcohol with >32:1 diastereoselectivity (Figure 11).44 The enantio- and diastereoselective addition step can be further coupled with efficient transformations en route to synthesis of natural products. As outlined earlier, a [3,3]-sigmatropic allyl cyanate-to-isocyanate rearrangement reaction was employed in the synthesis of glycocinnasperimicin D and pachastrissamine (jaspine B) (Figure 10)35,36 while a diastereoselective Schenk ene reaction with singlet oxygen was utilized in the synthesis of artemisin-type 1,2,4-trioxanes (Scheme 8).41 It is hopeful that synthetic chemists will adopt the tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations reactions presented herein in efficient synthesis of their natural products.\nFigure 11. Hong and coworkers diastereoselective vinyl carbonyl addition in the formal synthesis of leucascandrolide A.\nBoth Nugent's (+)- and (-)-MIB have found significant synthetic utility as a ligand of choice for addition of organozinc groups to carbonyl compounds. The efficient installation of chirality, coupled with tandem chemo-, regio- and diastereoselective transformations, provides high-value added building blocks that augment the synthetic organic chemist's repertoire of enantioenriched small molecules."

The top of the condenser is fitted with a stopcock connected to a vacuum line with an argon flow. Magnesium turnings (7.2 g, 0.3 mol, 1.2 equiv) are added and the apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum. After cooling to room temperature under an argon purge, the flask is charged with diethyl ether (100 mL) and equipped with a thermometer. 1,2-Dibromoethane (0.5 mL) (Note 2) is added to initiate the reaction with a slight increase of the internal temperature (2-3 \u00b0C). Benzyl bromide (30 mL, 0.25 mol) (Note 2) is injected into the mixture with a syringe pump at a rate so as to maintain a gentle reflux (15 mL/h). After the addition, the mixture is heated under reflux with an oil bath (oil bath temperature, 55 \u00b0C) for another 2 h. Another 3-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (3 cm length x 1.5 cm diameter) (Note 1) is fitted with two rubber stoppers and a 250-mL pressure equalizing addition funnel. The flask and funnel are flame-dried under vacuum.

The rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper, and the stirred (700 rpm) mixture is heated so as to maintain the temperature of the oil bath at 72 \u00b0C for 4 h (Note 3), during which period its color changes to orange. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL), and then transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a mixture of ethyl acetate :brine (25 mL:25 mL). The resulting pale yellow suspension is filtered through a short plug of Celite (Note 4), which is washed with ethyl acetate (about 1000 mL total) until no more product elutes (as checked by TLC). The organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40-80 mmHg, 28 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford crude imine 3 as a yellow oil (Note 5).

After 20 min, stirring is halted and Oxone (25 g, 0.0406 mol) is added in a single portion (Note 2). The flask is loosely covered and the slurry is stirred vigorously for 15 min while still submerged in the ice bath. After 15 min, the stir bar is removed from the reaction flask and rinsed with a small portion of distilled water.\nThe flask containing the reaction slurry is then attached to a rotary evaporator with the bath at room temperature. The bump bulb (250 mL) (Note 3) is chilled in a dry ice/acetone bath and a vacuum of 155 mmHg is applied via a benchtop diaphragm pump and an accompanied in-line vacuum regulator. During this process, the flask is rotated vigorously (210 rpm) to prevent bumping of the slurry into the bump trap (Note 4). After 15 min, the bath temperature is raised to 40 \u00b0C over the course of 10 min. When the bath reaches 40 \u00b0C, the distillation is halted immediately via releasing the vacuum and raising the flask from the heated water bath.\nThe pale yellow acetone solution of DMDO is decanted from the bump bulb directly into a graduated cylinder to measure the total volume of the solution (an average of 25 mL) and then the solution is dried over Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 is removed by filtration and rinsed with 10 mL of acetone. Titration of the obtained DMDO solution is then performed according to the procedure of Adam, et al.2 (Note 5). Results consistently show 2.1-2.3 mmol total DMDO in the solution, giving a final concentration typically in the range of 60-65 mM (Note 6). The DMDO solution was used immediately following titration."

The oily bottom layer is dissolved in the ether extract and washed first with 1 l. of a 2% sodium bisulfite solution, then with two 1-l. portions of 3% sodium carbonate solution, and finally with several portions of water. The ether solution is dried over 175 g. of potassium carbonate; the solvent is distilled on the steam bath. The yield of residual ester (Note 7) amounts to 2260\u20132400 g. (91\u201397%).",
            "B. Muconic acid. To a solution of 3 kg. of potassium hydroxide and 5 l. of methanol (Note 8) in a 12-l. flask, equipped as described above, is added in a thin stream from a separatory funnel (Note 6), and with stirring, 1130 g. (3.14 moles) of diethyl \u03b1,\u03b4-dibromoadipate. The ester is heated on the steam bath to nearly 100\u00b0 before it is added. The addition is so regulated as to permit rather vigorous refluxing and requires 45 minutes. Heating on the steam bath and stirring are continued an additional 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and is cooled. The potassium muconate and potassium bromide are filtered (Note 9), washed on the funnel with two 350-ml. portions of methanol and 400 ml. of ether, transferred without further drying to an enameled 11- to 12-l. pail, and dissolved in 8 l. of hot water. The aqueous solution, to which is added 30 g. of Norit, is heated to boiling by introduction of steam, filtered through a Norit filter pad by suction, and cooled in an ice-salt bath. The muconic acid is precipitated by the addition of a large excess (1.5 l.) (sp. gr. 1.18) of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the cold solution. The acid is added in a thin stream to the well-stirred solution. After 2 hours the muconic acid is filtered, washed first with two 400-ml. portions of cold water and then with 200 ml. of methanol, and dried at 85\u00b0. The yield of nearly colorless product melting at 296\u2013298\u00b0, with decomposition, amounts to 165\u2013195 g. (37\u201343%)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A diagrammatic sketch of the complete apparatus for the laboratory production and use of ozone in organic reactions is shown in Fig. 21.\nFig. 21.\nA. Purification train. Oxygen from a cylinder (A) fitted with a reducing valve (B) is led to a pressure release tube (C). This is a T-tube, the long arm of which dips into a test tube of mercury. The height of the mercury column should be about 2 to 3 cm. The release tube is connected through a stopcock (1) to a 40-cm. condenser jacket (D). This is filled with 4-mesh anhydrous calcium chloride held in place by plugs of glass wool at the ends. A second condenser jacket (E) is filled about halfway with 4-mesh soda lime, then a 4- to 6-in. layer of anhydrous calcium chloride, and the remainder of the tube is packed with glass wool. The ends of the condensers are closed with rubber stoppers. Part F is a flowmeter, the U-tube of which should be about 20 cm. long. The bore of the capillary should be about 0.5 mm. in diameter. The flowmeter tube is filled about half full with Hyvac pump oil. Part G is a condenser jacket (40 cm.) loosely packed with glass wool.\nAll parts up to the ozonizer may be connected with heavy rubber tubing or, preferably, Tygon tubing. If rubber tubing is used, it is desirable to place this purification train several feet from the ozonizer proper in order to prolong the life of the rubber connectors (Note 1). The sizes of parts C through G are not critical. After this part of the apparatus has been assembled, a very rapid stream of oxygen should be passed through it for 30 minutes in order to blow out all dust particles.",
            "B. Ozonizer. The conversion of oxygen to ozone is accomplished by means of three Berthelot tubes constructed of soft lime glass (Note 2) with the dimensions shown in Fig. 22. It is important that the glass be thoroughly cleaned and that the annular space through which the gases pass be as uniform as possible. Each tube has a cooling coil (Note 3) consisting of a long U-shaped piece of 6-mm. Pyrex glass tubing which fits into the innermost space of the Berthelot tube and reaches nearly to the bottom. The top of the Berthelot tube is closed by a cork with three holes, two for the cooling tubes and one for the inner electrode. The last is a stainless steel rod about 2\u20134 mm. in diameter. This electrode should extend to about 1 cm. of the bottom of the inner tube. The Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) are connected by means of mercury-cup seals as shown in Fig. 23 (Note 4). The third Berthelot tube is connected to the reaction vessels by means of either mercury-cup seals or ground-glass joints. No rubber connectors can be used for gases containing ozone.\nFig. 22.\nFig. 23.\nThe three Berthelot tubes are mounted vertically in a large battery jar about 13 in. by 9 in. by 18 in. (Note 5). They are held in place by a wooden top (see Fig. 23) which has holes and slots cut to fit the tubes. A second wooden block with holes and slots to fit the bottom of the Berthelot tubes (Fig. 22) is placed in the bottom of the battery jar. It should be weighted with a few pieces of lead. Both the top and the bottom blocks should be soaked in hot molten paraffin wax. The holes in the top should be directly above those in the bottom so that the Berthelot tubes will be as nearly vertical as possible to facilitate making good connections (Note 6). However, a slight slant of the tubes does not affect the operation of the ozonizer.",
            "C. Electrical equipment. A transformer operating on 110 volts alternating current having a secondary capable of producing about 8000\u201315,000 volts and a capacity of about 400 watts or more is suitable. It is important that provision be made for varying the secondary voltage. This may be done by purchasing a transformer provided with taps on the primary windings or by inserting a variable transformer in series with the primary (Note 7). During the initial test runs for calibration it is desirable to connect an ammeter in the primary circuit in order to make certain the transformer is not overloaded.\nThe inner electrodes of the Berthelot tubes are connected to one of the secondary terminals of the transformer. This wire must be grounded (Note 8); otherwise the cooling tube inside the Berthelot tube will act as a conductor to the water line and the laboratory water line would be charged. The other wire from the secondary is connected to the electrode in the battery jar. This outer electrode consists of a grid of stainless-steel wire (No. 8 or 10 B. and S. gauge). Connecting the inner electrode to the ground results in a charge on the battery jar. Precautions must be taken so that the jar is not touched while the current is passing. Also the battery jar must be kept away from any of the plumbing so that it will not be grounded. It is best to arrange a wooden shield so that the operator cannot come in contact with any of the high-voltage connections of the secondary.",
            "D. Ozone absorption assembly. One useful combination of reaction flasks is shown in Fig. 24. It is best that the parts be connected by ground-glass joints. Tube H is the main reaction flask (Note 9), I is a condensing tube surrounded by acetone and Dry Ice to trap any volatile compounds, and J is an auxiliary analyzing tube for determining the amount of ozone not absorbed by the compound in tube H. The tubes should be assembled and clamped high enough above the desk for cooling baths to be placed around tubes H and I in order that ozonizations may be carried out at temperatures below that of the surroundings.\nFig. 24.",
            "E. Ozone destroyer. Ozone is a powerful irritant. The maximum possible working concentration has been reported to be 0.15 to 1.0 part per million of air.1 It is necessary to destroy any excess ozone and to see that the exit tube from the above absorption assembly is connected to a good hood. It is safer to incorporate an ozone destroyer in the set-up. One such destroyer consists of two tall towers (30 in.) filled with broken glass moistened with 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and connected in series (Note 10). The room in which an ozonizer is used should be well ventilated.",
            "F. Analysis for ozone. The analysis is made by passing a definite amount of oxygen through the ozonizer at a selected secondary voltage and then through a neutral 2% solution of potassium iodide. Iodine is liberated, and the resulting solution is acidified with 10% sulfuric acid (about 15 ml.) and titrated with a previously standardized 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution using soluble starch as the indicator.",
            "G. Procedure and calibration of apparatus. For satisfactory use of an ozonizer it is desirable to obtain data relating rate of flow and secondary voltage with the amount of ozone produced.\nA wet-type gas meter (Note 11) is connected to the tube J as indicated in Fig. 24. Enough 2% potassium iodide solution (about 70 ml.) is added to absorption tubes H and J to fill them to a depth of about one-third to one-half their height, and the tubes are marked at this level (Note 12). The reducing valve of the oxygen tank is opened far enough to show a pressure of 3\u20134 lb. per sq. in.; stopcocks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are turned so as to by-pass H, I, and J and direct the gases through the ozone destroyer. Stopcock 1 is opened far enough to give a flowmeter reading of about 2\u20133 mm.; the transformer is turned on and adjusted to a definite voltage (Note 13). After the apparatus has been swept out for 5 minutes, the stopcocks are turned so as to pass the ozonized oxygen successively through tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter. The ozonized oxygen is passed through the potassium iodide solution for 5 minutes (stopwatch), and notes are made of the exact flowmeter reading and the volume of gas passing through the wet meter. At the end of 5 minutes the stopcocks are turned so as to by-pass tubes H, I, J, and the gas meter; and the ozonized oxygen stream is directed through the ozone destroyer. (Caution: do not pass the ozone through the wet gas meter.) The solutions in H and J are then combined, acidified, and titrated as described in paragraph F above. Practically all the ozone is absorbed in tube H. The second tube J is to prevent any damage to the wet gas meter.\nThe procedure is then repeated, the secondary voltage being kept constant but the rate of flow of oxygen being increased so that the flowmeter readings are about 5 mm. and 10 mm. The voltage is then changed so that the general range of 7000\u201312,000 volts in steps of about 1000 volts is obtained (Note 13). Determinations of ozone produced are made for each voltage and each rate of flow. These data may be plotted on coordinate paper in order to determine the performance of the ozonizer. A portion of such data is summarized in Table I, which represents the results from two different ozonizers constructed by different workers in different laboratories.\nTABLE I VARIATION IN PERCENTAGE (BY VOLUME) OF OZONE (FROM OXYGEN) WITH RATE OF FLOW AND SECONDARY VOLTAGE\nFlowmeter Reading, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nOzonizer 1\n2.0\n5.6\n1.3%\n3.1%\n4.5%\n6.0%\n...\n...\n6.0\n10.6\n0.9\n2.1\n4.2\n5.6\n...\n...\n12.0\n15.4\n0.5\n1.7\n3.6\n4.9\n...\n...\nOzonizer 2\n2.0\n5.7\n6.7%\n7.0%\n7.1%\n7.3%\n7.2%\n7.1%\n5.0\n9.8\n6.0\n6.5\n6.7\n7.2\n6.9\n6.8\n10.0\n14.4\n5.5\n6.2\n6.5\n6.7\n6.8\n6.9\nFor practical use in ozonolysis of compounds it is convenient to recalculate these data to show the time required to produce 0.1 mole of ozone at a specified rate of flow and voltage. This is illustrated by Table II.\nTABLE II HOURS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 0.1 MOLE OZONE FROM OXYGEN\nFlowmeter, mm.\nRate of Flow, l./hr.\nSecondary Voltage\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10,000\n11,000\n12,000\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\nhr.\n2.0\n5.7\n5.97\n5.55\n5.55\n5.48\n5.48\n5.48\n5.0\n9.8\n3.60\n3.55\n3.42\n3.32\n3.33\n3.33\n10.0\n14.4\n2.90\n2.57\n2.43\n2.32\n2.29\n2.26\nAll ozonizers have individual characteristics since it is difficult if not impossible to build two absolutely identical ozonizers. Variations in the composition of the glass and the annular space in the Berthelot tubes cause considerable changes in the amount of ozone produced, as shown by Table I. Hence the performances indicated by the data in Table I would be duplicated only under very fortuitous circumstances. The production of ozone from the same ozonizer may vary from time to time; hence it is desirable to check the percentage of ozone occasionally. If the production of ozone drops markedly, the Berthelot tubes should be carefully cleaned with hot nitric acid, thoroughly rinsed, and dried. Higher percentages of ozone may be obtained by having more Berthelot tubes. With six tubes, concentrations of 9\u201311% may be obtained.",
            "H. Ozonization of organic compounds. The ozonization of each unsaturated organic compound is more or less an individual problem, but some general comments may be made. Organic ozonides are highly explosive, and hence it is safest to carry out the ozonization in a solvent which dissolves both the original compound and the ozonide. In all cases, a shatter proof screen of laminated safety glass should be placed between the operator and the tubes H, I, and J. A second screen should be placed back of the tubes to protect other pieces of the apparatus.\nThe general procedure consists in dissolving a weighed amount of the compound in a suitable solvent such as glacial acetic acid, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, or carbon tetrachloride. The solution is placed in tube H, and such an amount is used that the same hydrostatic head is obtained as when the 2% potassium iodide solution was used in both tubes H and J. Usually both tubes H and I are surrounded by cooling baths. The ozonizer is started and the gases by-passed through the destroyer for about 5 minutes while the apparatus is attaining equilibrium. The ozonized oxygen is then passed through the solution of the compound for the calculated time. Since all organic compounds do not absorb ozone rapidly enough for a quantitative absorption it is frequently necessary to run the ozonization longer. The presence of unsaturation may often be detected by testing a small portion of the reaction mixture with a dilute solution of bromine in carbon tetrachloride. The ozonization is continued until the test with the bromine solution is negative.\nIt is also possible to place a solution of the compound in tube H to the proper height and use a 2% potassium iodide solution in tube J. At the end of the calculated time the contents of tube J are titrated in order to determine the amount of ozone that failed to react with the compound. From these data the additional time necessary to complete the ozonization is calculated and the apparatus operated accordingly (Note 14) and (Note 15).\nThe procedures for the decomposition of the ozonide and separation of the reaction products will vary according to the nature of the compounds and must be designed and selected accordingly.\nSelective ozonization of compounds containing different types of unsaturated linkages is possible by choosing a proper concentration of ozone and by stopping the ozonization at the right time. It is for this reason that the calibration described above is carried out, since for certain ozonizations it is important to have the correct concentration for best results.\n1. Use of air in place of oxygen. When air is the source of oxygen the exit gases from the Berthelot tubes contain lower percentages of ozone than when pure oxygen is used. The gases also contain small amounts of nitric anhydride,2 the presence of which may cause some side reactions to occur. However, a considerable number of compounds may be satisfactorily ozonized with air as the source of oxygen. The above apparatus will operate satisfactorily with compressed air. It is essential to bubble the compressed air through three 5-l. flasks half filled with concentrated sulfuric acid before passing the air into the purification train B, C, D, E, F, G. Some data on the production of ozone from air at a secondary potential of 10,000 volts are given in Table III.\nTABLE III PRODUCTION OF OZONE FROM AIR AT SECONDARY VOLTAGE OF 10,000\nRate of Flow\n15.3 l./hr.\n21.8 l./hr.\nOzone, % by volume\n3.0\n2.9\nHours for production of 0.1 mole ozone\n4.8\n3.4\nN2O5, % by volume\n0.13\n0.08\nMoles HNO3 formed per 0.1 mole ozone\n0.009\n0.006\nAt higher secondary voltages the percentage of nitrogen pentoxide rises. A decrease in the rate of flow also increases the amount of nitrogen pentoxide. It is obvious from the data in Table III that the amounts of nitrogen pentoxide are very small and need to be considered only when examining a reaction mixture for small amounts of by-products or when the presence of this oxide of nitrogen would act as a catalyst for the oxidation of the organic compounds by oxygen or ozone."

            "A. 2,2-Dimethylethylenimine. A cold mixture of 110 g. (60 ml., 1.06 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid and 200 ml. of water is added in portions, with shaking, to a solution of 100 g. (107 ml., 1.12 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.\nWater is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3), whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175\u00b0 over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30\u201360 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter. The flask is cooled and broken to remove the product.\nThe brown solid from the above operations is ground in a mortar and placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask equipped with a downward condenser and a receiver. A cold solution of 100 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added to the solid in the flask, and heat is applied by means of an oil bath whose temperature is slowly raised to 125\u00b0 From 70 to 75 g. of distillate is collected; the head temperature ranges from about 70\u00b0 to 101\u00b0 (Note 2). The distillate is cooled in ice and saturated with technical potassium hydroxide; the organic layer that forms is separated and dried over potassium hydroxide pellets in a refrigerator for about 15 hours.\nThe organic layer is separated from the drying agent and distilled from a few fresh pellets of potassium hydroxide through a column of the Whitmore-Fenske type. After a 3- to 5-g. fore-run, the product distils at 71\u201372\u00b0; the yield is 36\u201341 g. (45\u201351%) (Note 4) and (Note 5).",
            "B. tert-Butylamine. A hydrogenation bomb or bottle (Note 6) is charged with 100 ml. of purified dioxane,1 35.5 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled 2,2-dimethylethylenimine, and about 9 g. (alcohol-wet weight) of Raney nickel.2 The apparatus is filled with hydrogen, warmed to 60\u00b0, and shaken until hydrogenation is complete (Note 7). The contents of the bomb are removed and filtered to separate the catalyst, which is washed on the funnel with a little dioxane.\nThe filtrates from two such runs are combined and distilled through a Whitmore-Fenske column of 10\u201315 theoretical plates at a 5:1 reflux ratio. The yield of tert-butylamine is 55\u201360 g. (75\u201382%); the product boils at 44\u201344.5\u00b0, and its refractive index is nD20 1.3770 (Note 8).",
            "A. tert-Butylurea (Note 1). In a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a fast mechanical stirrer, a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 193 g. (105 ml., 1.98 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and 60 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered urea is added slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. Then 148 g. (188 ml., 2 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise from the funnel at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 (Note 2). After the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours) (Note 3), and then poured with stirring on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. Without removal of the precipitate, the mixture is made alkaline to Congo red indicator by adding slowly with stirring a solution of sodium hydroxide (160 g. in 750 ml. of water). The mixture is cooled with an ice bath to keep the temperature below 25\u00b0. The mixture is stirred in the ice bath until the temperature falls to about 15\u00b0 (Note 4), at which point the precipitate is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The cake is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of water is added.

The filtrate is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 with occasional stirring, and the white precipitate of tert-butylurea is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and pressed as dry as possible. After the product has been spread out on absorbent paper and air-dried overnight (Note 6) there is obtained 36\u201339 g. (31\u201333%) of tert-butylurea melting at 180\u2013182\u00b0 (Note 7).",
            "B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200\u00b0. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240\u00b0 (internal temperature 200\u00b0) and held there for 5 minutes (Note 8). The flask is removed and cooled to 60\u201370\u00b0, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0 and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40\u201343 g. and melts at 58\u201359\u00b0. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2\u20134 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43\u201346.5 g. (72\u201376%).",
            "C. tert-Butylamine hydrochloride. In a 2-l. flask fitted with an efficient bulb-type reflux condenser are placed 203 g. (1 mole) of tert-butylphthalimide, 1 l. of 95% ethanol, and 59 g. (1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate. The solution is refluxed for 2 hours and cooled, and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml.) is added until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red paper, though a large excess of acid is avoided. The voluminous precipitate of phthalhydrazide is collected on a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with the aid of suction and washed with four 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 200 ml. About 1 l. of water is added, any insoluble material is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 300\u2013350 ml. If any additional insoluble material separates it is removed by filtration, and the solvent is completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. This crude amine hydrochloride may be converted to the free amine as described below, or it may be purified by solution in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution being filtered and 500 ml. of dry ether being added to the filtrate. The crude amine hydrochloride is collected on a filter; the solvent is removed by suction, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute ethanol using 5 ml. per gram of material; absolute ether (50% of the volume of ethanol) is added, and the solution is cooled in a refrigerator for several hours. All the tert-butylamine hydrochloride is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator. It weighs 79\u201397 g.

            "D. tert-Butylamine. To 150 ml. of cold 40% solution of sodium hydroxide is added 109.5 g. (1 mole) of tert-butylamine hydrochloride with stirring. The solution is saturated with potassium carbonate (about 100\u2013150 g.); the layer of amine is separated and dried over 20 g. of sodium hydroxide pellets. The product is distilled using an ice-cooled receiver, and the fraction boiling at 44\u201346\u00b0 is collected. If the purified amine hydrochloride is the starting material for this step the yield ranges from 65 g. to 69 g. (89\u201394%). When the crude amine salt is employed, the yield is 46\u201360 g.

The flasks are placed in an ice-salt bath and chilled to 0\u00b0; to each flask there is then added 45 ml. (35.2 g., 0.78 mole) of acetaldehyde. When the contents of the flasks have cooled to \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 there is added to each flask, with shaking, a solution of 2 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol. The flasks, the contents of which become cloudy in a short time because of the separation of water, are kept in the ice-salt bath for 6 hours. The reaction mixtures are then combined in a 1-l. flask and placed in an icebox. About 24 hours later, 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with shaking, and the flask is replaced in an icebox until the next day. The addition of 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is repeated once more, and the mixture is again returned to the icebox for 24 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature. At some point during this reaction period the mixture should crystallize as a mass of yellow-white needles (Note 3). This product is crude ethyl ethylidenebisacetoacetate.\nThe crude bis ester is melted on a steam cone and poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask containing 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and approximately 10 g. of small chips of porous plate (Note 4). The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. There is a copious evolution of carbon dioxide which should be directed to a gas-absorption trap since it is accompanied by acetic acid vapors. The mixture is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2 l. of ice water in a 4-l. beaker. Enough ether is added to allow separation of the layers (Note 5), and the organic layer is returned to the beaker with 1.2\u20131.3 l. of water. With the aid of good stirring the mixture is neutralized by slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until the effervescence ceases. The layers are separated, and the material so obtained may be used immediately for the preparation of 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. To obtain 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, the ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with 100 ml. of water containing 2 ml. of acetic acid, is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. After a very slight fore-run the main fraction is collected at 135\u2013155\u00b0/10 mm. This is redistilled through a moderately good column, preferably of the Widmer or Vigreux type. The product is 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, b.p. 136\u2013138\u00b0/9 mm. The yield is 220\u2013234 g. (47\u201350%).",

The ether is removed on a steam cone, perferably with the aid of an aspirator, and there are added 1140 ml. of water, 60 ml. of ethanol (95%), and 130 g. of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is shaken continuously and heated on a steam cone until the alkali dissolves, and heating is continued on a steam cone with frequent shaking until the ester dissolves (Note 6). The solution is then refluxed for 15 minutes.\nThe flask is cooled with a stream of water while a solution of 100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water is added slowly and cautiously (Note 7).

The gas inlet tube is connected to a source of boron fluorides (Note 3), and an ice bath is applied to the reaction flask; when the temperature of the stirred mixture has fallen to approximately 0\u00b0 the stream of boron fluoride is started and adjusted so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 7\u00b0. The addition of boron fluoride is continued until the mixture is saturated and for 15 minutes thereafter (Note 4).

The methyl chloride is then allowed to distil into the reaction mixture during a period of about 3 hours. The reaction mixture and the tube containing the methyl chloride are cooled if the refluxing of the reaction mixture becomes so vigorous that the reflux condenser does not condense the methyl chloride. After all the methyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is warmed for 1 hour so that there is a gentle reflux.\nAt the end of this time, when almost all the magnesium has reacted, the Dry Ice cold finger is replaced with a water condenser and the gas delivery tube with a dropping funnel. A solution of 142 g. (2.02 moles) of freshly distilled crotonaldehyde in 300 ml. of dry ether is added dropwise while the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and cooled. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\nThe Grignard addition compound is decomposed by adding 435 ml. of a saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 5) dropwise, with vigorous stirring, to the thoroughly cooled reaction mixture. A dense white precipitate, too heavy to be stirred mechanically, forms and settles to the bottom of the flask. After the reaction mixture has been allowed to stand for 1 hour, the ether solution is poured off and the precipitate washed by decantation with two 300-ml. portions of ether.\nThe ether is removed by distillation, and the residual 3-penten-2-ol is distilled through a short column (Note 6) at atmospheric pressure. The yield of material boiling at 119\u2013121\u00b0 is 140\u2013150 g. (81\u201386%). Pure 3-penten-2-ol boils at approximately 120\u00b0/740 mm."

Carbon disulfide, used as a solvent in this preparation, is highly inflammable; its vapor may ignite on contact with a hot laboratory steam line.\nIn a 5-l. three-necked flask mounted on a steam bath in the hood and equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 1) and a wide-bore condenser (Note 1) is placed 1.4 kg. (1.1 l.) of carbon disulfide. Through the open neck of the flask 202 g. (1.5 moles) of acetanilide and 300 g. (2.66 moles) of chloroacetyl chloride (Note 2) are introduced. The mixture is vigorously stirred while 600 g. (4.5 moles) of aluminum chloride is added in 25\u201350 g. portions over a period of 20\u201330 minutes; the neck of the flask is stoppered between additions (Note 3). After the addition of the last portion of aluminum chloride, the mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 30 minutes while stirring is continued. Heating and stirring are discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand for 3 hours, during which time it separates into layers. The upper layer (carbon disulfide) is decanted, and the viscous red-brown lower layer is poured cautiously with stirring into about 1 kg. of finely crushed ice to which 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. After the hydrolysis of the aluminum chloride, the product crystallizes as a white solid, which is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed well with water.

Some crystals separate. The resulting thin slurry is dropped slowly into the cold solution of nitrosylsulfuric acid with mechanical stirring. Throughout the addition, and for 30 minutes thereafter, the temperature is kept below 20\u00b0. Seven hundred milliliters of dry ether is added slowly with stirring, and the temperature of the mixture is kept at 0\u00b0 for 1 hour. At the end of this period, the precipitation (aided by scratching) of the crystalline 4-nitronaphthalene-1-diazonium sulfate is complete (Note 1). This precipitate is collected, washed with ether and then with 95% ethanol until all the acid is removed, and finally dissolved in 100 ml. of iced water.\nA saturated aqueous solution containing 50 g. of crystalline copper sulfate is treated with a similar solution of 50 g. of crystallized sodium sulfite.

After stirring for 1 hour (Note 3), the mixture is filtered and the crude dark brown precipitate of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene is washed several times with water, then with 2% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and again with water. The precipitate is dried and extracted three times with boiling 95% ethanol (450 ml. in all). The extract is concentrated to 75 ml.; most of the 1,4-dinitronaphthalene separates and is collected. Additional amounts can be obtained by further concentration. The resulting product melts at 130\u2013132\u00b0 and weighs 6.0\u20137.0 g. (52\u201360%).

The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.\nWater is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3), whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175\u00b0 over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30\u201360 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter.

A 10\u201312 in. length of stout, flexible iron wire is passed through one of these pieces of tubing. Two liters of liquid ammonia (Note 2) and 2 g. of ferric nitrate hydrate are placed in the flask. One hundred grams of sodium (4.35 g. atoms) is cut into rectangular pieces about 3 by \u00be by \u00be in. in size. One of the pieces of sodium is hooked onto the lower end of the iron wire and lowered into the liquid ammonia. Stirring is not necessary during this part of the reaction, but it is advisable. When the lump of sodium has reacted, the solution turns from blue to gray, and the remaining pieces of sodium are added in the same manner. The addition requires about 45 minutes (Note 3).\nThe stopper carrying the iron wire is removed, 2 g. of anil is added, and then 528 g. (2 moles) of finely powdered, dry styrene dibromide is added gradually with vigorous stirring. The addition requires about 1 hour (Note 4). Stirring is continued for 2 hours (Note 5) after the addition has been completed, after which 600 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added, followed by 1 l. of distilled water, and the mixture is allowed to stand until the frost on the outside of the flask is entirely melted.\nThe aqueous solution is then steam-distilled from the same flask (Note 6) until no more oil passes over.

The mixture is cooled to a temperature below 10\u00b0 by means of an ice-water bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 66.1 g. (0.50 mole) of cinnamaldehyde (Note 1) in 60 ml. of absolute ether is added, the rate of addition being controlled so that the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0. Throughout the addition, which takes about 1 hour, a slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask (Note 2).\nThe flask is detached from the condenser and stirrer, and its contents are transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel. The apparatus is then reassembled, without the nitrogen inlet tube or the drying tube, and 175 ml. of 30% sulfuric acid (by weight) is placed in the flask. Without cooling, but with efficient stirring with a Hershberg Nichrome wire stirrer at 1500\u20131700 r.p.m. (Note 3),2 the ethereal solution of the cinnamaldehyde-methylmagnesium bromide adduct is added rapidly to the acid. The time for this addition (5\u20137 minutes) is limited by the efficiency of the condenser. Heat then is applied to maintain gentle reflux until the total time elapsed from the initiation of hydrolysis is 20 minutes. The contents of the flask are immediately transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, the lower aqueous layer is discarded, and the ether layer is washed successively with 50 ml. of water, a mixture of 50 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and 50 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution, and 50 ml. of water. Before each of the washings the air in the separatory funnel is displaced with nitrogen. When the second wash solution is added, 0.3 g. of phenyl-\u03b2-naphthylamine is dissolved in the ether layer. The washed solution is dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 30 minutes and then with 15 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for 12 hours.\nThe ethereal solution is filtered and concentrated by distillation from a steam bath to a residual volume of 80\u2013100 ml. Some water separates at this time, and the mixture is cooled and then dried with about 15 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The concentrated solution is filtered into a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask3 and distilled under reduced pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere into a receiver containing 0.3 g. of phenyl-\u03b2-naphthylamine. In this manner 52\u201354 g.

The solution is cooled, transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and diluted with 300 ml. of water. The \u03b1-phenylglutaric acid is extracted with five 100-ml. portions of ether-ethyl acetate (1:1) (Note 1). The extracts are combined, washed once with saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvents are removed as completely as possible by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is transferred to a 200-ml. flask. Acetic anhydride (50 ml.) is added, and the solution is heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. The excess acetic anhydride is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a short (15-cm.) Vigreux column with an air-cooled side arm. The product is collected at 178\u2013188\u00b0/0.5\u20131 mm. (Note 2). The yield is 31.1\u201332.7 g.

The solution is allowed to cool, and when crystallization occurs (usually at 40\u201350\u00b0) an additional volume (2 ml. per g. of the anhydride) of hexane is added. The mixture is cooled, and the crystalline product is removed by filtration and washed with cold hexane (5 ml. per g. of the anhydride).

In the flask are placed 4 l. of hot (about 90\u00b0) water and 145 g. (1.12 moles) of quinoxaline. With rapid stirring a saturated aqueous solution of 1050 g. (6.6 moles) of potassium permanganate (Note 4) is added through the dropping funnel in a thin stream. The rate of addition of the permanganate solution is adjusted so that the reaction mixture boils gently. The addition requires about 1.5 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled somewhat (Note 5) and filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The manganese dioxide cake is removed from the funnel and stirred to a smooth paste with 1 l. of fresh water. The slurry is filtered, and the washing is repeated. The total filtrate, about 10 l., is evaporated under reduced pressure on the steam bath to a volume of approximately 3 l. (Note 6). The solution is swirled or stirred gently while 550 ml. (6.6 moles) of 36% hydrochloric acid is cautiously added (Note 7). Evaporation under reduced pressure is then continued until a moist cake of solid potassium chloride and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid remains in the flask (Note 8).\nThe moist cake is scraped from the flask and allowed to dry in a 16-in. porcelain evaporating dish until the odor of hydrochloric acid is faint (about 24 hours, but this time can be reduced to about 8 hours if a gentle stream of air is directed onto the solid). The solid material is returned to the dried flask and mixed thoroughly with about 200 ml. of water. Two liters of acetone is added, and the mixture is boiled under reflux for 15 minutes, then cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 6-in. B\u00fcchner funnel. The solid on the filter is returned to the flask, treated with 100 ml. of water, and extracted with 1 l. of boiling acetone as before (Note 9). The acetone filtrates are combined and distilled from a steam bath, finally under diminished pressure.\nThe solid in the flask is dissolved by refluxing with 2.5 l. of acetone. The mixture is cooled slightly, treated with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, refluxed for an additional 5-minute period, and filtered hot. Evaporation of the pale yellow acetone filtrate leaves the acid as a light-tan crystalline solid. If the product still possesses an odor of hydrochloric acid it is dried in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide pellets for a few hours. Finally the product is dried in an oven at 100\u00b0 for several hours (Note 10) and (Note 11). The yield of material melting at 165\u2013167\u00b0 (dec.) is 140\u2013145 g. (75\u201377%) (Note 12).\nIf a purer product is desired the material may be recrystallized (with about 17% loss) from 150 ml. of water; the hot solution is decolorized with carbon. The melting point after drying at 110\u00b0 for several hours is then 183\u2013185\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 11) and (Note 13)."

            "Eleven and one-half grams (0.5 g. atom) of sodium is dissolved in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. Forty-six grams (0.52 mole) of 2-nitropropane is added, then 92.5 g. (0.50 mole) of o-xylyl bromide (Note 1). The flask is attached to a reflux condenser connected to a drying tube and shaken at intervals for 4 hours. The reaction mixture, originally at room temperature, becomes warm spontaneously, and a white precipitate of sodium bromide forms (Note 2).\nAfter a reaction period of 4 hours the sodium bromide is separated by filtration and the ethanol is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue of product and sodium bromide is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether and 150 ml. of water. The ether layer is washed with two 50-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution to remove any acetoxime and excess 2-nitropropane and is then washed with 50 ml. of water. The ether layer is separated and is dried with 15 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath.\nThe crude product is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The yield of o-tolualdehyde boiling at 68\u201372\u00b0/6 mm., n25D 1.5430, is 41\u201344 g. (68\u201373%) (Note 3)."

            "A solution of 170 g. (1.0 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of water in a 2-l. beaker is treated, with stirring, with a solution of 44 g. (1.07 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water (Note 1). The mixture is stirred for 5 minutes, and the silver oxide is collected on an 11-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel with suction and washed free of nitrates with water (Note 2). The wet, freshly precipitated silver oxide is transferred to a 4-l. beaker (Note 1), covered with 2 l. of water, and treated with 200 g. (4.85 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets with vigorous stirring. If the temperature of the mixture at this point is below 55\u00b0, the mixture is warmed to 55\u201360\u00b0. With continued stirring at 55\u201360\u00b0 (Note 3), 152 g. (1.0 mole) of vanillin (Note 4) is added; the reaction begins after a few minutes. The silver oxide is transformed to fluffy metallic silver, and considerable heat is evolved. Stirring is continued for 10 minutes, the mixture is filtered, and the precipitated silver is washed with 100 ml. of hot water. A rapid stream of sulfur dioxide gas (Note 5) is passed into the combined filtrate and washings for 2 minutes, and the resulting solution is poured into 1.1 l. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid with vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture, which should be acid to Congo red, is cooled to 15\u201320\u00b0. The vanillic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, pressed to remove the mother liquor, washed with 150 ml. of ice water (Note 6), sucked as dry as possible, and air-dried. The yield is 140\u2013160 g. (83\u201395%) of white needles melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0. This product is pure enough for most purposes, but it may be purified by recrystallization from water containing a little sulfur dioxide, 1.2 l. of water being used per 100 g. of product. Pure white needles melting at 210\u2013211\u00b0 are obtained with a recovery of 90\u201397%.",
            "In a stainless-steel beaker of approximately 2-l. capacity (120 mm. by 165 mm.) equipped with an efficient mechanical Nichrome or Monel stirrer (Note 1) and heated by an electric hot plate are placed 178 g. (4.3 moles) of 97% sodium hydroxide pellets, 178 g. (2.7 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets (Note 2), and 50 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and heated to 160\u00b0, at which temperature the hot plate is turned off. Twenty-five grams of vanillin is added. The temperature drops somewhat, and after a very short time a vigorous reaction begins which raises the temperature to 180\u2013195\u00b0. An additional 127 g. (total of 1.0 mole) of vanillin is gradually added to the reaction mixture during a period of 10\u201312 minutes at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature (Note 3). After all the vanillin has been added, stirring is continued for 5 minutes. The hot plate is removed, and the mixture is allowed to cool with stirring. When the mixture cools to about 150\u2013160\u00b0, 1 l. of water is added and the mixture is stirred until all the fusion mixture is dissolved. The solution is transferred to a 4-l. beaker, 500 ml. of water being used to rinse the stirrer and metal beaker. Sulfur dioxide gas is introduced for 1 minute (Note 4), and the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. The mixture is acidified with about 1.2 l. of 6N hydrochloric acid using Congo red as the indicator and keeping the mixture cool during addition of the acid by stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The mixture is cooled, and the light-tan precipitate is filtered, washed with 150 ml. of ice water, and dried. The yield of vanillic acid melting at 206\u2013208\u00b0 is 150\u2013160 g. (89\u201395%) (Note 5). The product can be recrystallized from water, using 1.2 l. per 100 g. of vanillic acid. A 90\u201397% recovery of nearly white vanillic acid melting at 209\u2013210\u00b0 is obtained."
