The flask is surrounded by an ice bath and cooled to 5\u201310\u00b0. A solution of 175 g. (3 moles) of acetone in 500 cc. of ether is added with stirring (Note 1). Then a solution of 160 g. (3.2 moles) of sodium cyanide in 350 cc. of water is added, with stirring, at such a rate that the temperature never exceeds 10\u00b0 (Note 2).\nThe reaction mixture is stirred for one hour after all the cyanide has been added and then is allowed to stand overnight. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous liquor is extracted with six 300-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and the ether is distilled. The residue, which consists mainly of acetone cyanohydrin, is diluted with 800 cc. of methyl alcohol. The solution is cooled and saturated with ammonia gas (Note 3). The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for two or three days (Note 4), and the excess ammonia is expelled by a current of air. The methyl alcohol is removed by distillation as completely as possible, and 600 cc. of water is added to the residue. Then 1 kg. of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid is added and the mixture is refluxed for two hours.\nThe hydrobromic acid is distilled under reduced pressure on a steam bath. The residue is treated with 400\u2013500 cc. of water, and the solution is again concentrated under reduced pressure to remove as much hydrobromic acid as possible (Note 5).\nThe residue is dissolved in fifteen to twenty times its weight of methyl alcohol (Note 6) and filtered, and an excess of pyridine (Note 7) is added. The free amino acid separates on standing overnight. It is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed thoroughly with methyl alcohol, and dried. The yield is 92\u2013102 g. (30\u201333 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a pyridine-free product is desired, it is dissolved in 200 cc. of warm water and filtered, and the filtrate is poured into 2 l. of methyl alcohol (Note 8). There is less than 10 g. of product in the mother liquors. It may be isolated by evaporating to dryness, washing with methyl alcohol, and purifying by reprecipitation in the same way."

While the solution is vigorously stirred, 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is poured slowly down the walls of the bottle; the mixture is then placed in the hood and protected from the light (Note 3). The temperature rises from 20\u201325\u00b0 to 35\u201340\u00b0 at once and to about 50\u00b0 in the course of two hours, when the reaction is nearly complete.

(288 cc., 5.6 moles) of bromine in 565 cc. of carbon tetrachloride is added to the well-stirred solution. The bromination proceeds very readily, and the hydrogen bromide which is evolved is led off through the condenser and absorbed in water. The addition of the bromine solution requires about three hours, during which time the temperature is maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0.\nAfter the addition of the bromine is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for about one hour. It then has a light yellow color. The solution is washed with water and then with two 500-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to remove any dissolved hydrobromic acid. The solution is dried over calcium chloride and filtered. The carbon tetrachloride is distilled through a good column until the temperature at the top of the column reaches about 120\u00b0. When the carbon tetrachloride has distilled, the oil is likely to turn dark and give off fumes.\nThe residue is added to a solution of 50 g. of sodium in about a liter of 95 per cent alcohol. The solution is boiled under a reflux condenser for about one hour (Note 2) and then allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is diluted with about 6 l. of water and the two layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three or four 500-cc. portions of carbon tetrachloride (Note 3), and the extracts are added to the bromomesitylene. This solution is then washed thoroughly with water. The carbon tetrachloride solution is separated, dried over calcium chloride, and distilled. After the carbon tetrachloride is removed the bromomesitylene is fractionated carefully under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 105\u2013107\u00b0/16\u201317 mm.

When the reaction is complete (about two hours or less) the cyanogen bromide is distilled from a steam bath, using a 500-cc. flask (Note 2) as a receiver. The distillate is warmed with about 100 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and again distilled, preferably with the distilling flask used as a receiving vessel connected directly to the flask from which the cyanogen bromide is being distilled. The product boils at 60\u201362\u00b0. It is melted in the receiver (Note 3) (Hood) and poured into a warm tared bottle. The yield of white crystalline solid (Note 4) melting at 49\u201351\u00b0 is 239\u2013280 g. (73\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "In a 500-cc. three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer (Note 1), are placed 45.5 g. (0.25 mole) of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (Note 2), 85 g. (1.5 moles) of iron (Note 3), and 100 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol (Note 4). The mixture is heated to boiling on a water bath, the stirrer is started (Note 5), and a solution of 5.2 cc. (0.06 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 25 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol is added slowly (Note 6). The mixture is refluxed for two hours after addition of the acid is complete. At the end of this time the apparatus is disconnected and the hot mixture is made just alkaline to litmus by the addition of the calculated amount of 15 per cent alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution (Note 7). Without allowing the mixture to cool, the iron is removed by filtration and the reaction flask is rinsed with two 50-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; the same alcohol is used to wash the iron residue. To the filtrate is added 84 cc. of 6 N sulfuric acid; the normal sulfate of 2,4-diaminotoluene precipitates. The mixture is cooled to 25\u00b0 and filtered by suction. The product is washed with two 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, dried in the air for two hours (Note 8) and then dried to constant weight at 110\u00b0. The yield is 49 g. (89 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts with decomposition at 249\u2013251\u00b0 (Note 9).\nA solution of 20 g. of 2,4-diaminotoluene sulfate in 200 cc. of water at 60\u00b0 is cooled to 40\u00b0 (Note 10), and made alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution (Note 11). To this solution is added 15 g. of the sulfate, which is dissolved by raising the temperature of the mixture to 55\u00b0. The solution is cooled to 40\u00b0 and made slightly alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is then cooled to 30\u00b0 and filtered by suction. The remainder of the diaminotoluene sulfate (14 g.) is then dissolved in the filtrate by heating the mixture to 55\u00b0. The solution is cooled to 40\u00b0 and again made alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is cooled to 25\u00b0, and the diaminotoluene crystals are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel. The entire product is dried to constant weight in a desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield is 26.5 g. (95 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the diaminotoluene sulfate used) of a product melting at 97\u201398.5\u00b0.\nThe crude diaminotoluene (Note 12) is dissolved in eight times its weight of benzene (212 g.) at 70\u00b0, and the solution is filtered quickly through a hot B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 13) with moderate suction (Note 14). The filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0, and the mother liquor is decanted from the brown crystals. The mother liquor is concentrated to a volume of 25 cc. by distillation under atmospheric pressure and then cooled to 25\u00b0. The mother liquor is decanted from the diaminotoluene, and the entire product is dried in the air. The yield is 22.5 g.

            "A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by the cautious addition of 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of clean sodium to 600 cc. of anhydrous ethyl alcohol (Note 1) in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a mercury-sealed stirrer, and a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube. The flask is then immersed in an ice-salt bath and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the solution has reached 10\u00b0 (Note 2) an ice-cold solution of 196 g. (2 moles) of cyclohexanone (Note 3) in 292 g. (2 moles) of ethyl oxalate (Note 4) is added from the dropping funnel over a period of about fifteen minutes. Vigorous stirring is required to prevent complete solidification of the reaction mixture (Note 5). When the addition is complete, the ice bath is retained for an hour, and then the mixture is stirred at room temperature for about six hours.\nThe reaction mixture is then decomposed by the careful addition of ice-cold dilute sulfuric acid prepared by adding 56 cc. of concentrated acid (sp. gr. 1.84) to 435 g. of ice. During this neutralization the temperature of the mixture is maintained at about 5\u201310\u00b0 by means of an ice-salt bath. The solution, which should now be acid to Congo red paper, is diluted with cold water to a volume of about 4 l. The ethyl 2-ketocyclohexylglyoxalate separates as a heavy oil and is removed. The aqueous solution is extracted with four 500-cc. portions of benzene. The crude product is combined with the extracts, and the resulting solution is washed with two 200-cc. portions of water. The benzene solution is then allowed to stand in a separatory funnel for a few minutes until it is free from suspended water.\nThe benzene solution, without drying, is transferred in portions of about 500 cc. to a 1-l. Claisen flask connected to a water-cooled condenser. The flask is heated on the steam bath until the benzene no longer distils. The steam bath is then replaced by an oil bath and the system is gradually evacuated to a pressure of 10\u201312 mm. while the oil bath is held at about 90\u00b0. When all the benzene, unchanged ester, and ketone have distilled (Note 6) the temperature of the oil bath is increased. When the temperature of the distillate reaches 105\u00b0/10\u201312 mm. the receiver is changed. The bath temperature is immediately raised to 175\u00b0 and all material distilling between 105\u00b0 and 165\u00b0 at 10\u201315 mm. is collected. This requires one-half to one hour. During this time the bath temperature is slowly increased to 200\u00b0 to obtain the last portions. The yield is 250\u2013265 g. (63\u201367 per cent of the theoretical amount). The distillate is transferred to a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask, and a trace of iron powder and some finely ground soft glass are added (Note 7). The mixture is distilled at 40 mm. with the bath temperature maintained at 165\u2013175\u00b0 (Note 8). Carbon monoxide is evolved and the distillate is collected between 125\u00b0 and 140\u00b0. About one and a half to two hours is required for the pyrolysis. The yield of ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate is 200\u2013210 g. (59\u201362 per cent of the theoretical amount based on cyclohexanone). This product, whose refractive index at 25\u00b0 varies from 1.476 to 1.479, is sufficiently pure for use in the next step without redistillation.\nIn a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a special stirrer (Note 9) is placed 100 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 300 cc. of anhydrous methyl alcohol. The stirred mixture is heated for one hour in an oil bath held at 120\u00b0 in order to effect solution of most of the sodium hydroxide. Stirring and heating are continued while 100 g. (0.59 mole) of ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate is added over a period of two hours. The resulting mixture is heated for one hour longer with the bath temperature at 120\u00b0. It is then diluted with 600 cc. of water and the condenser is arranged for distillation. The methyl alcohol is removed by distillation until a thermometer immersed in the boiling solution reads 98\u2013100\u00b0. The residual aqueous solution is vigorously stirred, and exactly 210 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is carefully added drop by drop from a dropping funnel (Note 10). The hot acid solution is treated with 2\u20134 g. of Darco and is filtered through a heated B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath. The pimelic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and is crystallized from 100 cc. of boiling water for each 45 g. of acid. After drying in the air the acid melts at 103.5\u2013104\u00b0 and weighs 65\u201373 g. The mother liquors from the hydrolysis and recrystallization are combined and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The resulting solid is extracted with two 500-cc. portions of acetone. The acetone is distilled from a steam bath, and the residual crude pimelic acid is recrystallized from the minimum quantity of benzene, yielding an additional 10\u201312 g. of pure material. The total yield is 75\u201383 g. (80\u201388 per cent of the theoretical amount based on ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate; 47\u201354 per cent based on cyclohexanone).",
            "Four hundred cubic centimeters of freshly distilled isoamyl alcohol (b.p. 128\u2013132\u00b0) is heated to 90\u2013100\u00b0 on an oil bath in a 5-l. two-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel and reflux condenser. Two hundred forty grams (10.4 gram atoms) of clean sodium is then added, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised rapidly until the alcohol is brought to vigorous boiling (Note 1). A solution of 100 g. (0.73 mole) of salicylic acid in 2 l. of isoamyl alcohol is allowed to flow into the flask at the rate of 100 cc. every four minutes, so that the entire amount is added over a period of eighty minutes. The dropping funnel is then rinsed with 100 cc. of isoamyl alcohol. The solution in the flask is clear at first, then becomes cloudy with the addition of the salicylic acid. The temperature of the oil bath is regulated so that the alcohol refluxes rapidly throughout the course of the experiment. The sodium goes completely into solution in seven to eight hours.\nThe flask is then allowed to cool to 100\u00b0, and 800 cc. of hot water is added with vigorous shaking (Note 2). The hot mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, the flask being rinsed with 200 cc. of hot water (Note 3). The mixture is shaken well and the layers separated. The isoamyl alcohol layer is extracted with four or five 200-cc. portions of nearly boiling water (Note 4). The combined aqueous extracts are then steam-distilled in order to remove any isoamyl alcohol from the aqueous solution of the sodium salt. About 500 cc. of distillate is collected (Note 5).\nThe flask is allowed to cool, and 920 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The unchanged salicylic acid is then steam-distilled from the mixture. The flask is strongly heated, so that its contents are concentrated and, towards the end of the distillation, sodium chloride begins to precipitate. The removal of salicylic acid is practically complete when about 10\u201312 l. of distillate has come over, although the distillate still gives a ferric chloride test for salicylic acid. The solution in the flask is allowed to cool overnight and is finally chilled in an ice bath.\nThe crystalline precipitate, which is a mixture of sodium chloride and pimelic acid, is then collected on a suction filter without washing. The product is dried in an evaporating dish on the water bath for several hours, with frequent stirring, whereby the brown mass is partially melted. The mass, after cooling, is transferred to a 500-cc. Soxhlet thimble. The Soxhlet apparatus is mounted over a hot plate and the solid extracted with about 650 cc. of benzene. Complete extraction is indicated when the liquid in the siphon is no longer turbid (Note 6). The extraction is complete when evaporation of a small quantity of the solution in the extractor leaves no residue (two to three hours). After the extraction is complete, the benzene solution is concentrated to about 300 cc. and the pimelic acid allowed to crystallize. The crystals are collected on a filter, washed with cold benzene, and dried in the air. The product melts at 104\u2013105\u00b0 and weighs 50\u201358 g. (43\u201350 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

Two grams of vanadium pentoxide (Note 2), 450 g. (4.2 moles) of sodium chlorate, and 1 l. of water are placed in the flask; the stirrer is started, the mixture is heated to 70\u201375\u00b0 (Note 3), and about 5\u201310 cc. of 200 g. (2.06 moles) of furfural (Note 4) is added. As soon as a vigorous reaction starts the balance of the furfural is added rapidly enough to maintain it (Note 5). The entire addition requires seventy to eighty minutes. Then the mixture is heated at 70\u201375\u00b0, with stirring, for ten to eleven hours and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The crude fumaric acid is filtered with suction and dried in the air. It weighs 155\u2013170 g. (65\u201372 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6).\nMore fumaric acid may be obtained from the filtrate by heating it on the water bath with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid; the solution usually turns blue at the end of the reaction. The solution is concentrated to about 700 cc. and then cooled with running water. The fumaric acid which separates is collected on a filter and dried in the air. It weighs 10\u201315 g. and melts at 282\u2013284\u00b0 in a sealed tube.\nThe crude product is purified by recrystallization from about 1250 cc. of 1 N hydrochloric acid. This gives 100\u2013110 g. of pure fumaric acid, melting at 282\u2013284\u00b0 in a sealed tube. An additional amount of the acid may be obtained by concentrating the filtrate to a small volume on a water bath. The total yield of pure fumaric acid is 120\u2013138 g.

The flask is equipped with a 150-cm. reflux condenser in which the inner tube is very wide (2.5 cm.). As soon as the alcohol begins to boil, the steam is shut off and the temperature is maintained by introducing strips of sodium through the top of the condenser. The total amount of sodium added is 500 g., and it should be added as rapidly as is possible without loss of alcohol (Note 2). The last 150 g. of sodium melts in the hot mixture and may be added very rapidly without loss of alcohol or amine.\nAs soon as the sodium has dissolved, the contents of the flask are cooled and diluted with 5 l. of water. The flask is equipped at once with a condenser set for distillation, and the distillate is carried below the surface of a solution of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 300 cc. of water in a 12-l. flask. The distillation is continued as long as any basic material passes over. When frothing interferes toward the end of the distillation an additional 3 l. of water is added to the distillation flask. The total distillate is 8\u20139 l.\nThe alcohol, water, and unreacted oxime are removed by heating the acid distillate on the steam cone under reduced pressure (about 20\u201330 mm.); the amine hydrochloride crystallizes in the flask. The flask is then cooled and equipped with a reflux condenser through which 1 l. of 40 per cent potassium hydroxide solution is introduced.

The lower alkaline layer is removed and solid potassium hydroxide is added to the amine in the funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and fresh sticks of potassium hydroxide are added from time to time until no further separation of an aqueous alkaline solution occurs. Twenty-four to thirty hours is required for complete drying. The amine is then decanted through the top of the funnel into a 250-cc. modified Claisen flask and distilled.

The reaction starts slowly, and sometimes it is necessary to add some iodine or use Gilman's catalyst (Note 1). After the reaction starts, it proceeds smoothly and the remaining 298 g. of bromomesitylene (a total of 2 moles) in about 700 cc. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the ether boils briskly. After the last of this ether solution has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam cone until practically all the magnesium has dissolved (Note 2).\nThe solution of the Grignard reagent is cooled to about 10\u00b0, and to it, while stirring vigorously, is added a solution of 600 g. (4.8 moles) of methyl sulfate (Note 3) in about 500 cc. of dry ether. The reaction is very vigorous, and bumping may occur as the result of the separation of insoluble magnesium compounds. The addition of the methyl sulfate requires two to three hours. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand (Note 4) for about twenty-four hours and is then decomposed by adding dilute hydrochloric acid through the separatory funnel. Stirring is started as soon as the mass is fluid enough. When the mixture is decomposed completely, the ether layer is separated and washed three times with water. After the magnesium salts have been removed, the ether layer is evaporated and the residue is added slowly to a solution of 30 g. of sodium in 500 cc. of absolute alcoholx (Note 5). The mixture is boiled for about one-half hour. Then the solution is cooled, 150\u2013200 cc. of ether is added, and the alkali and alcohol are removed by washing thoroughly with water (Note 6). Finally the ether solution is dried over calcium chloride, the ether is distilled, and the residue is warmed on a water bath for three to four hours with 25\u201330 g. of metallic sodium (Note 7).

Two 250-cc. long-necked distilling flasks, cooled in ice-water baths, are used in series as receivers; the vapors are led to the center of each flask by an adapter and glass tubing.\nTwo hundred grams (0.95 mole) of u.s.p. citric acid monohydrate is placed in the Kjeldahl flask (Note 2) and heated with a free flame until melted. Then the flask is heated very rapidly with a Meker burner, and the distillation is completed as quickly as possible (ten to twelve minutes). Superheating must be avoided (Note 3). The distillate consists of water and itaconic anhydride, most of which distils at 175\u2013190\u00b0. The distillate is immediately poured into a separatory funnel and the lower layer of itaconic anhydride is separated (Note 4). The yield of the anhydride is 40\u201350 g.

It is of sufficient purity for use in the preparation of citraconic anhydride (p. 140) (Note 5) and (Note 6).\n(B) Itaconic Acid.\u2014Forty grams of itaconic anhydride is refluxed with 100 cc. of water for one hour.

The stirrer is started, and to the hot solution 200 g. (0.92 mole) of ethyl sec.-butylmalonate (Note 2) is added slowly. The solution refluxes quietly owing to the heat of saponification. After all the sec.-butylmalonic ester has been added, the solution is boiled gently for two hours. It is then diluted with 200 cc. of water, and 200 cc. of liquid is distilled from the solution in order to remove all the alcohol formed during the saponification (Note 3).\nThe residual liquid in the flask is allowed to cool, and a cold solution of 320 g. (3.3 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 4) in 450 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel. This should be done slowly and with stirring in order to prevent foaming. The solution becomes hot and may reflux spontaneously. After all the sulfuric acid has been added the solution is refluxed for about three hours. A layer of organic acid appears and the reflux condenser is replaced by an automatic separator (Note 5). The solution is distilled with the separator attached, and the aqueous portion is returned to the distilling flask. This operation is continued until practically all the organic acid has been driven over; from ten to fifteen hours is required. At the end, about 100 cc. of water is collected in the separator and extracted with ether in order to remove the dissolved acid (Note 6).

            "In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a separatory funnel, is placed 24.3 g. (1 gram atom) of magnesium turnings (Note 1). The magnesium is covered with 100 cc. of anhydrous ether, and 10 cc. (15 g., 0.07 mole) of \u03b1-bromonaphthalene (Note 2) (with a crystal or two of iodine) (Note 3) is added to start the reaction. A warm water bath (45\u00b0 or higher) is placed under the flask until the reaction starts. The stirrer is started, and a solution of 192 g. (0.93 mole) of \u03b1-bromonaphthalene in 500 cc. of anhydrous ether is added to the magnesium at such a rate that the reaction is vigorous but not violent. The addition requires from one and one-half to three hours. The water bath is again placed under the flask, and stirring and refluxing are continued for one-half hour after the addition of the halide is complete. The Grignard reagent which collects as a heavy oil in the bottom of the flask is dissolved by the addition of 533 cc. of dry benzene (Note 4).\nThe reaction mixture is then cooled by an ice-salt mixture. The separatory funnel is replaced by a two-holed rubber stopper containing a thermometer (bulb immersed in the reaction mixture) and a glass tube drawn out to make a fine capillary (Note 5). When the temperature of the reaction mixture has reached \u22127\u00b0, the condenser is replaced by an entry tube, 10 mm. in diameter and adjusted so that the end is about 50 mm. above the surface of the reaction mixture (Note 6). The reaction mixture is stirred, and dry carbon dioxide is added through this tube (Note 7). The rate of flow of the carbon dioxide is regulated so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above \u22122\u00b0. The time required for the completion of the reaction varies from one and one-fourth to one and one-half hours. When the reaction is complete, the temperature falls below \u22127\u00b0 and does not rise on increasing the rate of flow of carbon dioxide.\nThe flask is placed in an ice bath, and 25 per cent sulfuric acid is added slowly, with stirring, until no further reaction takes place and all the excess magnesium has dissolved (Note 8). The oily layer is separated, and the water layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether-benzene extracts (Note 9) are shaken with three 100-cc. portions of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide. Each alkaline layer is extracted successively with a 100-cc. portion of ether, and the combined alkaline extracts are then heated to 100\u00b0 to drive off volatile impurities.\nThe solution is cooled and acidified strongly with 50 per cent sulfuric acid. The crude \u03b1-naphthoic acid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed until free from sulfate, and dried. The yield of crude material melting at 142\u2013155\u00b0 is 130\u2013135 g. This is dissolved in 400 cc. of hot toluene, a small amount of Filter-Cel is added, and the solution is filtered through a hot B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath, filtered with suction, and the filter cake washed with cold toluene until the filtrate is practically colorless. A light-colored product melting at 159\u2013161\u00b0 is obtained. The yield is 118\u2013121 g. (68\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 10)."

The stirrer is started, and the flask is heated with steam until the reaction starts. This may take from fifteen minutes to one hour; the flask must be watched quite closely because the reaction, when once started, is very vigorous and evolves a large amount of heat. As soon as the reaction has started, 750 g. of n-butyl ether is added and then the balance of the solution of 2-bromopentane in n-butyl ether is added at such a rate that the temperature is kept at 50\u201360\u00b0. External cooling is used in order to allow more rapid addition of the 2-bromopentane. After addition is complete (about three hours), the mixture is heated on a steam bath for one hour.\nIn the meantime, a 12-l. flask containing a solution of 450 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 3 l. of water is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a stirrer, a separatory funnel, and an efficient ice-cooled condenser set for distillation. The stirrer is started, and the solution of the Grignard reagent, prepared above, is added. The acid solution is allowed to become warm but is kept below the boiling point by external cooling. After all the Grignard reagent has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam bath until no more pentane distils. The reaction flask is allowed to cool, and the n-butyl ether layer is separated, transferred to a 5-l. flask connected with the condenser, and heated with a free flame until the boiling point of the n-butyl ether is reached (Note 4). The combined distillate is separated from a small amount of water, washed twice with 125-cc. portions of cold, concentrated sulfuric acid, and allowed to stand overnight with anhydrous potassium carbonate.

            "(A) Symmetrical o-Phthalyl Chloride.\u2014A mixture of 148 g. (1 mole) of phthalic anhydride (Note 1) and 220 g. (1.06 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride (Note 2) is placed in a 500-cc. Claisen flask. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, the upper end of which is provided with a calcium chloride tube, and the side arm of the flask is closed with a cork. The flask is inclined slightly so that any phosphorus oxychloride which collects in the stoppered side arm will run back into the flask. After heating in an oil bath at 150\u00b0 for twelve hours, the air condenser and the stopper in the end of the side arm are removed, and the flask is connected to a water-cooled condenser. The temperature is then raised gradually to 250\u00b0, during which time most of the phosphorus oxychloride distils into a receiver. The liquid residue is distilled under reduced pressure; at first a small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride distils, and then the sym. o-phthalyl chloride distils at 131\u2013133\u00b0/9\u201310 mm. The product thus obtained contains a small amount of phthalic anhydride; it solidifies on cooling in an ice-salt mixture and melts at 11\u201312\u00b0 (Note 3). The yield is 187 g. (92 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Unsymmetrical o-Phthalyl Chloride.\u2014A mixture of 105 g. of the symmetrical o-phthalyl chloride and 75 g. of finely ground aluminum chloride (Note 4) is heated on a steam bath for eight to ten hours, with exclusion of moisture. The mixture should be stirred frequently until all the powder has dissolved. Upon cooling there is formed a hard mass which is broken into small pieces while still warm. When thoroughly cool, it is triturated with pieces of ice in a mortar, working with small amounts at a time. The white sediment which results is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and dissolved immediately in about 300 cc. of warm benzene (40\u201350\u00b0). The benzene solution is separated from the small aqueous layer, dried over calcium chloride for eight hours, and filtered. The benzene is distilled under reduced pressure by heating in a water bath at 30\u201340\u00b0. The crystalline residue is extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether (b.p. 20\u201340\u00b0) until the residue in the thimble consists of practically pure phthalic anhydride (Note 5). The petroleum ether is distilled from the extract, and the crude unsymmetrical phthalyl chloride is purified by fractional crystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 20\u201350\u00b0). The purified chloride melts at 87\u201389\u00b0. The melting point is not sharp because the unsymmetrical compound begins to revert to the symmetrical isomer. The yield of pure unsymmetrical phthalyl chloride is about 76 g. (72 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is dependent on the quality of the aluminum chloride used."

            "In a 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-cc. separatory funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser to which a calcium chloride tube is attached, are placed 107 g. (4.4 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings and 800 cc. of anhydrous ether. The reaction is started by adding 5 cc. (7 g., 0.06 mole) of ethyl bromide (Note 1) without stirring. The stirrer is started, and a solution of 480 g. (4.4 moles) of ethyl bromide in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added as rapidly as the refluxing of the ether allows. The addition requires about two hours (Note 2). The reaction is practically complete when all the halide has been added, but stirring should be continued for fifteen minutes longer.\nA solution of 156 g. (1.32 moles) of ethyl carbonate (Note 3) in 200 cc. of ether is added to the Grignard reagent, with rapid stirring, over a period of approximately three hours. The reaction is vigorous, and the ether refluxes continually. After all the diethyl carbonate has been added, the flask is heated on a water bath and stirring is continued for another hour.\nThe reaction mixture is hydrolyzed by pouring it, with frequent shaking, into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and a solution of 300 g. of ammonium chloride in 600 cc. of water. The ether layer is separated in a large separatory funnel, and the aqueous residue is extracted with two 500-cc. portions of ether (Note 4).\nThe ether is distilled from the combined extracts, and the crude triethyl carbinol is dried with 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The alcohol is then distilled at atmospheric pressure, and the portion (80\u201390 g.) boiling at 139\u2013142\u00b0 is collected. The low-boiling distillate is treated with 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and redistilled, whereby another portion (about 25 g.) of triethyl carbinol boiling at 139\u2013142\u00b0 is obtained. The process is repeated once, or twice if necessary, and an additional 20 g. is collected (Note 5). The total yield is 125\u2013135 g. (82\u201388 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6). Triethyl carbinol is a viscous liquid with a penetrating, camphor-like odor."

        "Procedure": [
            "Benzylidenearginine, Method 1.\u2014To 500 g. of gelatine (Note 1) is added 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19); the mixture is warmed on the steam bath for thirty minutes and boiled over a free flame for eight to ten hours (Note 2) under a reflux condenser provided with a trap for hydrogen chloride gas. The solution is concentrated to 400 cc. on the steam bath under reduced pressure, employing the apparatus shown in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 427. The syrupy residue is then diluted with 500 cc. of distilled water and again concentrated to 400 cc. This process of dilution and evaporation is repeated twice more (Note 3). The final residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of hot distilled water and decolorized by adding 15 g. of decolorizing carbon and heating for ten minutes on the steam bath. The filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath and treated with 250\u2013350 cc. of a 40 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide until slightly alkaline to litmus, keeping the temperature below 10\u00b0. An additional 70-cc. portion of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added, keeping the temperature below 5\u00b0; this is followed by the addition, in four portions, of 225 cc. of benzaldehyde, with vigorous shaking after each addition, the temperature being held below 5\u00b0 throughout (Note 4). The addition of the benzaldehyde occupies about ten minutes.\nThe resulting emulsion is allowed to stand overnight in the refrigerator at 0\u20135\u00b0; the crystalline precipitate is filtered by suction and washed first with 80 cc. of ice-cold water in four portions, then with 50 cc. of a mixture of two volumes of ether and one volume of methyl alcohol, and, finally, with ether (Note 5) until the washings are colorless and free of benzaldehyde. After drying in a vacuum desiccator the product weighs 35\u201340 g.; it melts with decomposition at 206\u2013207\u00b0 (corr.).\nBenzylidenearginine, Method 2.\u2014The hydrolysis of 500 g. of gelatine and the removal of excess hydrochloric acid are conducted as described above. After treatment with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon the filtrate is diluted to 2.5 l., heated almost to boiling, and treated with 110 g. of 2,4-dinitro-1-naphthol-7-sulfonic acid (\"flavianic acid\") (Note 6) dissolved in 400 cc. of hot water. The mixture is boiled (Note 7) for about three minutes and diluted with boiling water to a total volume of 4 l. The mixture is cooled rapidly to 45\u00b0 and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, with occasional stirring and vigorous scratching of the walls of the container. After standing for about two hours at room temperature (Note 8), practically all (Note 9) the arginine dinitronaphtholsulfonate should have separated in crystalline, readily filterable form. The product is filtered by suction and washed first with three 100-cc. portions of a 0.5 per cent solution of dinitronaphtholsulfonic acid and then with two 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. After being dried in air, the product weighs 113\u2013118 g. (Note 10); it decomposes at 245\u2013265\u00b0 (Note 11).\nOne hundred grams (0.21 mole) of finely powdered arginine dinitronaphtholsulfonate is added, all at once, to 230 cc. of cold 2 N sodium hydroxide; the salt dissolves readily on agitation. There is then added without delay (Note 12) 35 g. (0.33 mole) of benzaldehyde, in four portions and with vigorous shaking, each portion being accompanied by 75 cc. of ice-cold water. During this process, benzylidenearginine separates as a crystalline cake. The mixture is allowed to stand at 15\u201320\u00b0 for one to two hours, whereupon the product is filtered (Note 13) and washed successively with two to four 50-cc. portions of ice-cold water, three 20-cc. portions of a mixture of 20 cc. of methyl alcohol and 40 cc. of ether, and finally two 50-cc. portions of ether (Note 5). It is then dried in air. The yield is 39\u201343 g., corresponding to about 44\u201348 g. from 500 g. of gelatine (Note 10).\nArginine Hydrochloride.\u2014A suspension of 50 g. (0.18 mole) of benzylidenearginine in 39 cc. of 5 N hydrochloric acid is heated in a boiling water or steam bath for forty-five minutes, with occasional shaking. The mixture is allowed to cool and is freed of benzaldehyde by shaking with three 100\u2013150 cc. portions of ether. The aqueous solution is filtered if necessary, decolorized with 3 g. of decolorizing carbon, filtered, and concentrated on the water bath at 70\u00b0 under reduced pressure until crystallization sets in. The residue is transferred from the flask with the aid of 25 cc. of hot 70 per cent ethyl alcohol; the arginine hydrochloride is precipitated by adding 300 cc. of absolute alcohol. After filtering the product, a further small quantity of crystalline hydrochloride is obtained by adding 300 cc. of ether to the mother liquor. The combined (Note 14) yield amounts to 33\u201334 g. (88\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 220\u00b0 (corr.) and exhibits a rotation of [\u03b1]25\u00b0D = +12.2 to 12.3\u00b0 (5 per cent in water)."

While the mixture is still hot, the excess benzyl chloride is removed by steam distillation (Note 4). Near the end of this operation the benzyl phthalimide crystallizes. It is advisable to cool the mixture rapidly with very vigorous agitation so that the material is in as fine a state of division as possible. The solid is filtered on a large B\u00fcchner funnel, thoroughly washed with water, and drained as completely as possible by suction. It is then washed once with 400 cc. of 60 per cent alcohol and drained again. The yield of this product, melting at 100\u2013110\u00b0, is 340\u2013375 g.

Chlorine is to be introduced by means of a 4-mm. glass tube, inserted through a cork in a neck of the flask, extending close to the bottom of the flask and provided with a small bulb with fine perforations to break up the gas stream into small bubbles. The large quantities of hydrogen chloride formed can be disposed of by means of a gas absorption trap.\nInto the tared flask are placed 126.5 g. (1 mole) of p-chlorotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 170) and 3.8 g. of phosphorus pentachloride. The flask is heated in a bath kept at 160\u2013170\u00b0 (Note 2), and while illuminated with direct sunlight or with an unfrosted 100-watt tungsten lamp a rapid stream of chlorine is introduced directly from a cylinder until the gain in weight is 55\u201366 (Note 3).\nThe pale yellow or yellow-green product is then transferred to a 4-l. wide-mouthed bottle containing 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and stirred vigorously (Hood) for five hours (Note 4). The viscous mixture is then transferred to a separatory funnel and allowed to stand overnight, after which the lower layer (Note 5) is run slowly, with stirring, into a 3-l. beaker three-quarters filled with cracked ice.

The yield of p-chlorobenzaldehyde distilling at 108\u2013111\u00b0/25 mm. and melting at 46\u201347\u00b0 is 76\u201384 g. (54\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "To 68 g. (0.5 mole) of phenylacetic acid (Note 1) in a 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a system for absorbing hydrogen chloride, is added 35 g. (0.25 mole) of phosphorus trichloride. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for one hour. While the contents of the flask are still warm, 400 cc. of dry benzene is added. The benzene solution of phenylacetyl chloride is decanted from the residue of phosphorous acid onto 75 g. (0.56 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride in a dry, 1-l. flask which can be fitted to the same condenser. The reaction is vigorous at first and cooling is necessary. The mixture is refluxed for one hour on a steam bath, then cooled and poured into a mixture of 500 g. of cracked ice and 200 g. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with a mixture of 100 cc. of benzene and 100 cc. of ether (Note 2). The ether-benzene solution is washed once with 100 cc. of water (Note 3), and then dried over 40\u201350 g. of calcium chloride. The solution is filtered (Note 4) with suction into a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 5); the residue consists of a brown oil which solidifies on cooling.\nThe crude material (91\u201392 g.) is purified by distillation under reduced pressure from a 250-cc. Claisen flask (Note 6). The product distils at 160\u00b0/5 mm. (172\u00b0/15 mm.; 200\u00b0/30 mm.) as a colorless oil which solidifies on cooling. The yield is 81\u201382 g. (82\u201383 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the phenylacetic acid used) of a product which melts at 53\u201354\u00b0. The product is recrystallized from methyl alcohol, using 4 cc. of solvent for each gram of product (Note 7); the yield is 55\u201356 g. of crystals melting at 55\u201356\u00b0. An additional 7 g. of crystals melting at 55\u201356\u00b0 is obtained by cooling the filtrate in an ice-salt bath. On further cooling of the mother liquors, about 5 g. of crystals melting at 54\u201355\u00b0 is obtained. The total yield of purified product is 67\u201370 g. (Note 8). Further recrystallization of the product from methyl alcohol does not raise the melting point above 55\u201356\u00b0."

The addition takes one hour, and the temperature is kept below 8\u00b0 by the addition of ice if necessary. When all the nitrite has been added the mixture is allowed to stand one hour and then filtered.

(1.6 moles) of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (m.p. 70\u00b0) in a 5-l. flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser and heated on the steam bath with stirring for five hours. When the contents of the flask are cold, the condensation product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and well drained by means of a suction pump and a piece of \"rubber dam\" fastened over the top of the funnel. The rubber is drawn down onto the solid by the suction, thus forcing the liquid out. The dark green solid is washed by transferring it to a large beaker, stirring it with 1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol on the steam bath for half an hour, cooling, and filtering again, using the rubber dam. The dinitrobenzylidene-p-aminodimethylaniline is placed while still damp in a large round-bottomed flask containing 500 cc. of a mixture of equal volumes of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water, and steam is blown in by a tube reaching to the lowest part of the vessel. Vigorous injection of steam is continued for fifteen minutes after the liquid has reached a temperature of 105\u00b0 (Note 3).\nWhen cold the aqueous layer is decanted (or filtered) from the solidified product, and the process of steam-agitation with acid is repeated, another 500 cc. of dilute acid being added (Note 4). Finally the solid is filtered, washed with water, and dried in vacuo. The crude dinitrobenzaldehyde so obtained weighs 170\u2013210 g. and melts at 40\u201350\u00b0. It is purified by heating in two lots each with 8 l. of naphtha (b.p. 90\u2013110\u00b0) in a large flask on the steam bath with mechanical stirring for three hours, decanting the solution (temperature of liquid 80\u00b0) and allowing the aldehyde to crystallize. The purified dinitrobenzaldehyde, air-dried, weighs 79\u2013104 g. (24\u201332 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 69\u201371\u00b0 (Note 5). From the mother liquors impure material may be recovered by evaporation or by distillation in steam, from which by a similar process of crystallization a further 20 g. of aldehyde of m.p. 66\u00b0 can be separated."

It is then attached to a condenser for distillation, and the solution is concentrated to 600\u2013700 cc. The excess ammonia is recovered during this process by connecting the lower end of the condenser to a wide tube leading to the bottom of a 3-l. bottle containing 1.5 l. of distilled water and connecting this in the same way with a smaller bottle containing a little water. The bottles are cooled by running water. About 2 l. of 20\u201323 per cent ammonium hydroxide is recovered in the first receiver (Note 1).\nThe residual solution is then transferred to a 2-l. beaker, a solution of 50 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 100 cc. of water and a little decolorizing carbon are added, and the mixture is boiled until the odor of ammonia is completely absent (Note 4). The solution is filtered by suction, diluted to 500 cc. with water, and transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and cooled by running water. While stirring and cooling below 30\u00b0, 150 g. (1.1 moles) of benzoyl chloride (Note 2) and a cold solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water are admitted separately from separatory funnels at such rates that the solution is always only slightly alkaline. About an hour is required for adding the reagents, and the mixture is stirred for a half hour longer. It is then poured into 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 2-l. beaker, and, after cooling, the precipitate is filtered and dried. The weight at this point is 150\u2013160 g. The solid is placed in a beaker with 300 cc. of technical carbon tetrachloride, the beaker is covered with a watch glass, and the mixture is boiled gently for ten minutes. The mixture is then cooled slightly, filtered by gentle suction, and the hippuric acid washed on the filter with 50 cc. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 5). After drying, it weighs 135\u2013140 g. For final purification the acid is dissolved in about 2 l. of boiling water, filtered through a steam-heated funnel and allowed to crystallize without artificial cooling. It then appears in characteristic white needles melting at 186\u2013187\u00b0. The yield is 115\u2013122 g. (64\u201368 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid used). Upon concentrating the mother liquor to 200 cc., a further 6\u20137 g. of slightly brown hippuric acid is obtained."

The flask is set in an empty pan of suitable size to serve as a bath in case cooling becomes necessary. With the stirrer in operation, 493 g. (2.05 moles) of crystalline sodium sulfide containing nine molecules of water of crystallization is added to the chlorohydrin solution at a rate which will maintain the temperature at 30\u201335\u00b0. This will require from forty to sixty minutes. After all the sodium sulfide has been added the solution is stirred for thirty minutes.\nThe stirrer is removed, and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and a thermometer which dips into the liquid. The flask is then heated on a steam bath until the temperature of the liquid is 90\u00b0, and for a period of forty-five minutes the temperature is held at 90\u201395\u00b0. The solution is then cooled to 25\u00b0 and neutralized to turmeric paper by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid drop by drop (Note 2). After filtering, the solution is returned to the flask for concentration at reduced pressure.\nThe flask is equipped with a short column attached to a condenser set for distillation. A capillary is provided to prevent bumping. The water is then distilled at a pressure of 30\u201340 mm. by heating the flask in a water bath which is raised to the boiling point as rapidly as is consistent with smooth distillation. The residue in the flask, which consists of sodium chloride and thiodiglycol, is extracted twice with 500-cc. portions of hot absolute alcohol in order to dissolve the sulfide. After the second extraction, the salt is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel and is washed with a little hot alcohol (Note 3).\nThe extract and washings are returned to the distilling flask, and the alcohol is removed under reduced pressure. When practically all the alcohol has distilled, the temperature of the bath is raised to 100\u00b0 and the residue is heated for three hours under 30-mm. pressure (Note 4).\nThe crude product, which is colorless or very pale yellow, weighs 200\u2013215 g. It boils at 164\u2013166\u00b0/20 mm. and may be purified by vacuum distillation (Note 5). The yield of pure material is 180\u2013195 g. (79\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

A solution of 40 g. of sodium hydroxide in 100 cc. of water is then added and the mixture cooled, first in cold water, and finally by a freezing mixture of ice and salt.\nIn a 2-l. beaker, set in a freezing mixture and provided with a stirrer and a thermometer for reading temperatures to 0\u00b0, are placed 500 cc. of water, 137 g. (1 mole) of anthranilic acid, and 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid; the stirrer is started and the mixture cooled to about 6\u00b0. Meanwhile 69 g. (1 mole) of sodium nitrite is dissolved in 280 cc. of hot water and the solution cooled in ice; portions are then placed in a separatory funnel of convenient size, supported in such a way that the lower end of the stem extends beneath the surface of the anthranilic acid solution. When the temperature has fallen to 5\u00b0, the nitrite solution is run in; about 500 g. of cracked ice is added at such a rate as to keep the temperature below 5\u00b0. This takes about ten minutes (Note 1). A drop of the solution should give an immediate blue color with starch-iodide paper.\nThe stirrer and thermometer are now transferred to the alkaline sulfide solution, the temperature of which must be below 5\u00b0. The diazo solution is added over a period of twenty to thirty minutes along with 950 g. of ice to prevent the temperature from rising above 5\u00b0. When addition is complete, the water bath is removed and the mixture allowed to warm up to room temperature; after two hours the evolution of nitrogen ceases (Note 2). About 180 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the solution is acid to Congo red paper, and the precipitate of dithiosalicylic acid is filtered and washed with water.\nTo remove the excess sulfur, the precipitate is dissolved by boiling with a solution of 60 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate (soda ash) in 2 l. of water, and the mixture is filtered while hot. It is divided into five equal parts (Note 3), and the dithiosalicylic acid is reprecipitated as before with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solid is filtered, the cake being sucked as dry as possible.\nThe moist cake is mixed with 27 g. of zinc dust and 300 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the mixture is refluxed vigorously for about four hours (Note 4). When the reduction is complete, the mixture is cooled and filtered with suction. The filter cake is washed once with water and then transferred to a 1-l. beaker. The cake is suspended in 200 cc. of water, and the suspension is heated to boiling. The hot solution is made strongly alkaline by the addition of about 40 cc. of 33 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is boiled for about twenty minutes to ensure complete extraction of the product from the filter cake, filtered from the insoluble material (Note 5), and the thiosalicylic acid is then precipitated by the addition of sufficient concentrated hydrochloric acid to make the solution acid to Congo red paper. The product is filtered with suction, washed once with water, and dried in an oven at 100\u2013110\u00b0. The yield of a product which melts at 162\u2013163\u00b0 is 110\u2013130 g. (71\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the anthranilic acid).\nThis product is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 6).\nFor recrystallization 5 g. of this material is dissolved in 20 cc. of hot 95 per cent alcohol, and 40 cc. of water is added. The solution is boiled with a little decolorizing carbon, filtered hot, and then allowed to cool. The product crystallizes in yellow flakes. The yield of recrystallized material is 4.7 g.; the melting point of the material is 163\u2013164\u00b0."

Into A, contained in a water bath at 20\u00b0, is placed 200 g. (2.17 moles) of dry toluene; then 30 g. (0.3 mole CuCl) of cuprous chloride (Note 1) and 267 g. (2 moles) of finely powdered anhydrous aluminum chloride are added rapidly with active stirring.\nFig. 18\nA mixture of hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide (Note 2) is led to the bottom of the reaction bottle through tube B at such rates that the carbon monoxide is admitted uniformly during seven hours and the hydrogen chloride at about one-half this rate. The rates of flow of the two gases may be compared by the bubbling in wash bottles C and D. The extent of absorption can be estimated from the bubbling of the effluent gases in wash bottle E. The carbon monoxide is absorbed almost quantitatively at the beginning, and as the mixture thickens the absorption becomes less complete.\nThe mixture is hydrolyzed by adding it (Note 3) slowly and with shaking to 1.5 kg. of cracked ice in a 3-l. flask. The resulting mixture is then steam-distilled until all the aldehyde and unchanged toluene are driven over. Fifty cubic centimeters of ether is added to the distillate, the two layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with 150 cc. of ether which is then added to the first non-aqueous layer (Note 4). After drying with calcium chloride, the aldehyde is obtained by distilling from a 500-cc. flask provided with a short fractionating column (Note 5).

Norite is added, and the hot mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (Note 2). The filtrate is allowed to stand in an icebox overnight, and then the precipitate (Note 3) of uramil is collected on a filter and washed with liberal quantities of dilute hydrochloric acid and finally with water (Note 4). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to about 1 l. and cooled overnight. The additional uramil thus obtained is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and added to the first product (Note 5). The uramil is dried in a desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid, and finally over 40 per cent sodium hydroxide to remove hydrochloric acid (Note 6).\nUramil is a fine, white powder which becomes pink to red on standing. The yield of a product which does not melt below 400\u00b0 is 40\u201346 g. (63\u201373 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

To this is added a mixture of 78 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl iodide and 54.4 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl bromide (Note 4); the stirrer is started and the mixture heated to refluxing. After one-half hour of refluxing, the reaction starts (Note 5), as is evidenced by the greatly increased rate of refluxing, and the flame is removed. If the reaction becomes too vigorous, the flask is cooled with ice water, but only to the point where the reaction is again under control (Note 6). At the end of one-half hour from the time the flame is removed, the reaction is usually over. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 7), connected with a distilling head, condenser, and receiver, and the contents are distilled under reduced pressure (Note 8) directly from the reaction flask into a 200-cc. round-bottomed flask immersed in an ice-salt mixture (Note 9).

The extension of this vent is covered with a test tube carrying another small tube for admitting carbon dioxide; the end of the test tube is then loosely plugged by a piece of cotton wool (Note 11). The apparatus is swept out with carbon dioxide, and the round-bottomed flask containing the once-distilled diethyl zinc is connected to the column. The diethyl zinc is then redistilled at atmospheric pressure. The yield of material boiling at 115\u2013120\u00b0 is 50\u201352 g.

The stirrer is started, and a solution of 80 g. (2 moles) (Note 1) of commercial sodium hydroxide in 120 cc. of water is added. Stirring is continued until the uric acid is in solution (Note 2), after which the solution is cooled by means of a stream of water directed against the flask. When the temperature has fallen to 25\u201330\u00b0, 50 g. (0.32 mole) (Note 3) of potassium permanganate is added all at once (Note 4) to the vigorously stirred solution. Stirring is continued for fifteen to twenty minutes (Note 5), and the mixture is filtered (Note 6) at once through a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The first fraction of the filtrate contains a small amount of manganese dioxide. This fraction must be collected separately and returned to the funnel. As soon as the filtrate becomes clear it is collected in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask which contains 130 cc. (137 g., 2.2 moles) of glacial acetic acid. The filtrate is tested with litmus to be sure that it is acid, and evaporated to a volume of 1.5\u20132 l. on a steam bath under reduced pressure (20\u201330 mm.).

The mixture is placed in a 3-l. flask equipped with a reflux condenser and is boiled for three hours. The solution is then poured into 3 l. of water and acidified by the addition of a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 cc. of water. The acid which separates is washed twice with warm water, shaken intermittently for one hour with 100 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and then filtered with suction. The yield of crude ricinoleic acid thus obtained is 480 g. The acid should be oxidized at once (Note 2).\nTwo hundred and forty grams (0.8 mole) of the dried ricinoleic acid is dissolved in 1.6 l. of water containing 64 g. of potassium hydroxide. A 12-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with a powerful mechanical stirrer, and in it are placed 625 g. (3.5 moles) of potassium permanganate and 7.5 l. of water at 35\u00b0. The mixture is stirred to facilitate solution of the permanganate, and, if necessary, heat is applied to maintain the temperature at 35\u00b0. When the permanganate has completely dissolved, the alkaline solution of ricinoleic acid is added in a single portion with vigorous stirring (Note 3). The temperature rises rapidly to about 75\u00b0. Stirring is continued for a half hour, or until a test portion added to water shows no permanganate color.\nThe oxidation mixture is now divided into two equal portions and each portion is treated as follows: To the mixture is added a solution of 200 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 600 cc. of water (Note 4). The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 15 minutes to coagulate the manganese dioxide which is filtered while still very hot (Note 5). After filtration the manganese dioxide is placed in a 4-l. beaker and boiled with 2 l. of water to dissolve any azelaic acid that may adhere to it. This mixture is filtered while hot, and the filtrate is added to the main portion.\nThe combined filtrates and washings for the two portions of the oxidation mixture are evaporated to a volume of about 4 l., and this solution is cooled in ice. The crystals which separate are filtered with suction, washed once with cold water, and dried. The yield is 70\u201380 g. of material having a melting point that may vary from 95 to 105\u00b0.\nThe crude substance is dissolved in 1.2 l. of boiling water, filtered with suction, and allowed to cool. The crystals are filtered, washed with water, and dried. There is obtained 48\u201355 g. of product (32\u201336 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the amount of crude ricinoleic acid taken for oxidation). The melting point of the purified azelaic acid is 104\u2013106\u00b0."

Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), and 2.6 g. of freshly fused sodium acetate. A few chips of porous plate are added, and the flask is provided with a cork bearing a thermometer, which reaches almost to the bottom, and a wide, bent glass tube leading to a condenser. The tube ends just at the lower edge of the cork and does not protrude into the neck of the flask. The flask is imbedded up to the neck in a sand bath and is heated rapidly until the thermometer reaches 230\u00b0; then the temperature is raised slowly until the water produced in the reaction and some entrained organic matter pass out through the exit tube. The water is collected in a small vessel and its quantity noted from time to time in order to follow the progress of the reaction. The operation should be conducted so that the temperature rises from 230 to 240\u00b0 in the course of about two hours. The reaction is maintained at 240\u00b0 until the distillation of water ceases; this requires about one additional hour.\nThe flask now contains a brown mass covered with a film.

The temperature of the vapor at the top of the column remains constant at 91\u00b0 over a period of three to three and one-half hours while the azeotropic mixture of n-butyl alcohol and water distils (Note 2). After two hours, the upper layer of n-butyl alcohol in the distillate is separated from the water, dried with a little anhydrous potassium carbonate or magnesium sulfate, and returned to the reaction mixture through the separatory funnel. Likewise, after the third hour of heating, the n-butyl alcohol in the distillate is separated, dried, and returned to the reaction flask.\nDuring the third hour of heating, the temperature at the top of the column rises slowly as the removal of the water approaches completion. After the fourth hour, when the temperature of the distilling vapor has attained 110\u2013112\u00b0, the heating is discontinued, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-l.

The crude isobutyl bromide is distilled from the reaction mixture under diminished pressure, e.g., at about 50\u00b0/200 mm.

            "In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a long reflux condenser and an efficient mechanical stirrer, are placed 92 g. (4 gram atoms) of clean metallic sodium and about 150 cc. of xylene. The sodium is finely powdered by heating the flask until the sodium melts and then cooling with very vigorous stirring. The cooled xylene is decanted, and the powdered sodium is thoroughly washed with four or five portions of dry, alcohol-free ether. About 1.2 l. of absolute ether is added (Note 1), and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a 250-cc. separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer (Note 2).\nThe stirrer is started, and 232 g. (2 moles) of purified ethyl n-butyrate (Note 3) is slowly run in from the separatory funnel. It is advisable to add first a portion of about 25 cc.; the heat of reaction soon causes the ether to boil; the rest of the ester is then run in at such a rate that gentle ebullition is maintained. Stirring is continued until there is no further reaction and practically all the sodium has been converted into the voluminous yellow-white solid which begins to appear almost at once (Note 4).\nThe reaction flask is now surrounded by an ice bath, and the contents are vigorously stirred while a cooled solution of 210 g. of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 350 cc. of water is carefully run in from the separatory funnel. The stirrer is now removed and the flask is allowed to stand in the ice bath until the lower layer of hydrated sodium sulfate (Na2SO4\u00b710H2O) has solidified. The ether solution is decanted and the sodium sulfate crystals washed with 100\u2013200 cc. of ether.\nThe combined solution and washings are shaken with about 100 cc. of 20 per cent sodium carbonate solution (Note 5) and are then dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether and alcohol are removed rapidly by distillation, and the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure in a 250-cc. modified Claisen flask (Note 6). The main fraction boils at 80\u201386\u00b0 at 12 mm.; a fraction boiling up to about 15\u00b0 above the main fraction should also be collected. The low-boiling and high-boiling fractions can be refractionated for recovery of a small additional amount of butyroin. The total yield is 94\u2013101 g. (65\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) of product that is colored yellow by traces of the diketone (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

            "A solution of 450 g. (2 moles) of stannous chloride crystals (Note 1) in 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is placed in a 3-l. beaker provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer and cooled in an ice bath. When the temperature of the solution has fallen to +5\u00b0, 100 g. (0.66 mole) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde (Note 2) is added in one portion. The temperature rises slowly at first, reaching 25\u201330\u00b0 in about five minutes, then rises very rapidly to about 100\u00b0. Stirring must be vigorous or the reaction mixture may be forced out of the beaker (Note 3). During the reaction the nitrobenzaldehyde dissolves, and an almost clear, red solution is obtained. The solution is cooled in an ice-salt mixture until the temperature has fallen to about +2\u00b0. During the cooling, orange-red crystals separate and a pasty suspension results.\nA 250-cc. separatory funnel is fixed so that its stem extends below the surface of the pasty suspension. A solution of 46 g. (0.67 mole) of sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is placed in the funnel and is slowly added to the well-stirred mixture until it shows a positive starch-iodide test for nitrous acid. The temperature of the mixture is maintained between 0\u00b0 and +5\u00b0 (Note 4) throughout the addition of the nitrite solution, which requires about ninety minutes. Usually, all but 5\u20138 cc. of the nitrite solution must be added before a positive test for nitrous acid appears.\nDuring the latter part of the diazotization of the aminobenzaldehyde, a hot solution of cuprous chloride is prepared. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 189 g. (0.75 mole) of powdered copper sulfate crystals and 161 g. of sodium chloride are dissolved in 600 cc. of hot water, and to this solution is added a solution of 41 g. (0.22 mole) of sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) and 27 g. (0.67 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. The final temperature of the resulting cuprous chloride solution should be about 75\u00b0.\nThe diazonium solution is added to the hot cuprous chloride solution while the latter is shaken by hand but is not cooled. After the solutions are thoroughly mixed, 840 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is steam-distilled to separate the m-chlorobenzaldehyde, which is collected practically completely in the first 1.5 l. of distillate. The m-chlorobenzaldehyde is removed from the aqueous distillate by extraction with two 150-cc. portions of ether, and the ethereal solution is dried with 10\u201315 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. After being decanted from the drying agent, the ether is distilled, and the residual liquid is distilled under diminished pressure. The m-chlorobenzaldehyde boils at 84\u201386\u00b0/8 mm., 107\u2013109\u00b0/26 mm. (Note 5). The yield is 70\u201374 g. (75\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6)."

The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and, with rapid stirring, the adipyl chloride is added through the dropping funnel at an even rate during the course of forty-five minutes (Note 1). The reaction mixture darkens slowly but does not become black.

The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 28.5 cc. (88 g., 0.55 mole) of dry bromine (Note 1) in 230 cc. of chloroform is added slowly from the dropping funnel during a period of about thirty minutes. The temperature of the mixture should not exceed 15\u00b0 during the bromination; the hydrogen bromide evolved is continuously removed by aspirating a gentle stream of air over the surface of the solution. After all the bromine has been added, stirring is continued for about fifteen minutes. The solution is then transferred to a distilling flask, and the solvent is completely removed under diminished pressure at room temperature (Note 2). The slightly colored residue is crystallized from 125 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The dibenzoyldibromomethane is obtained in the form of white crystals melting at 94\u201395\u00b0.

The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and diluted with 150\u2013200 cc. of water with constant shaking to dissolve the inorganic salt and to precipitate the triketone hydrate, which separates as a white, curdy mass (Note 4). This is separated by filtration, washed well with water, and dried in an oven at 60\u00b0. The melting point varies from 65 to 90\u00b0, depending upon the extent of dehydration that occurs during the drying operation. The yield is 41.5 g.

The neck of the receiving flask must be warmed, however, to prevent clogging of the apparatus by crystallization of the distillate. The anhydrous triketone distils at 174\u2013176\u00b0/2 mm. as a reddish oil that solidifies to a light yellow, crystalline mass. This is dissolved in 70 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013120\u00b0); it separates on cooling in light yellow needles which melt at 68\u201370\u00b0. The yield is 35 g.

The original filtrate is saturated with dry sodium sulfate (30\u201335 g.) and is then extracted with the ether which was used for washing the precipitate, together with an additional 100 cc. of ether. The ether is separated from the aqueous layer, and the latter is extracted four times with 100-cc. portions of fresh ether. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure, using a 500-cc. Claisen flask equipped with a 500-cc. receiver. The acid boils at 109\u2013111\u00b0/17\u201318 mm. and weighs 115\u2013116 g. (74 per cent of the theoretical amount). By redistilling the low-boiling fraction and collecting the portion boiling at 150\u2013210\u00b0, there is obtained an additional 7\u201310 g. of material which is chiefly ethoxyacetic acid and may be combined with the main fraction for conversion to the ester.\n(B) Ethyl Ethoxyacetate.\u2014The ethoxyacetic acid, which should amount to about 125 g.

The flask is set in a pan filled with cold water (Note 3), and dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. After the mixture becomes saturated (Note 4) it is allowed to stand twenty-four hours to ensure the completion of the reaction at room temperature (Note 5). The solution is cooled, and a saturated solution of sodium carbonate is added cautiously and with stirring to avoid excessive foaming. The addition is continued until the mixture is faintly alkaline to litmus; an excess of sodium carbonate lowers the yield and should be avoided. The ester is extracted with four 100-cc. portions of ether; the extract is dried with 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled at ordinary pressure. The yield of ester boiling at 153\u2013155\u00b0 is 110\u2013115 g. (55\u201358 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid, or 69\u201372 per cent based on the ethoxyacetic acid)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A mixture of 1350 cc. of water and 1650 cc. (20 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is placed in a 30 by 30 cm. glass jar or a 40-l. crock and stirred mechanically (Note 1) while strongly cooled by an ice-salt mixture. Two thousand and seventy-five grams (16 moles) of aniline hydrochloride (Note 2) and a solution of 1.2 kg. (17 moles) of sodium nitrite in 1.5 l. of water are made ready. When the temperature of the acid has reached 5\u00b0 or below, about one-third of the aniline hydrochloride is added to it, and diazotization is begun by the slow addition of the nitrite solution, the temperature being held below 7\u00b0. Additional aniline hydrochloride is added from time to time in such amounts that an excess of crystals is always present. The entire amount may be added by the time that half of the nitrite has been added. The diazotization is stopped when a positive test for free nitrous acid is obtained with potassium iodide starch paper. This should require nearly all the nitrite solution.\nFluoboric acid is made concurrently with the diazotization by the addition, in small amounts, of 1 kg. (16.2 moles) of boric acid (u.s.p. crystals) to 2150 g. (65 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid (Note 3). The addition is carried out in two 3-l. flasks coated with wax (Note 4) which are shaken and kept cold by immersion in iced water. The temperature of the acid should not be allowed to rise above 20\u201325\u00b0.\nThe ice-cold solution of fluoboric acid is then poured into the diazonium solution, which has been cooled below 0\u00b0. The temperature should remain under 10\u00b0 during the addition, which is carried out fairly rapidly. Powerful stirring is required to agitate the thick magma at this stage (Note 1). After twenty to thirty minutes' stirring, the brown-colored mass is filtered with suction, using two 24-cm. B\u00fcchner funnels. The yellowish crystalline solid is washed with about 800 cc. of iced water, with the same volume of methyl alcohol, and with about 900 cc. of commercial ethyl ether. The solid should be sucked as free as possible from liquid after each washing. This washing is important, since it improves the stability of the product (Note 5).\nThe light-brown, fluffy salt is spread out on absorbent paper overnight in a current of air (a table placed near a hood is effective), and is then placed in a 12-l. flask (Note 6). This is connected by a wide bent tube through a long, wide condenser to three 2-l. Erlenmeyer flasks arranged in series and immersed in ice-salt mixtures. The last flask is fitted with an exit tube leading to a good hood, to carry off the voluminous fumes of boron fluoride, or to an absorption system containing ice and water or soda solution (Note 7). The solid is heated gently at one point near its surface with a small flame until decomposition begins. The flame is then withdrawn and the reaction allowed to continue spontaneously as long as it will. If the reaction becomes too vigorous, it may be necessary to cool the flask by rubbing it with a piece of ice (Note 8). The mixture is heated cautiously from time to time, as may be necessary to keep the reaction going. At the last it should be heated vigorously until no more fumes of boron fluoride are evolved. The last traces of fluorobenzene may be removed from the reaction flask by applying a slight suction to the receiving flask.\nThe combined distillate is separated from any phenol which may have settled out. It is washed four or five times with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the washings are almost colorless and then once with water (Note 9). It is dried by shaking with crushed calcium chloride, and then distilled from a 2-l. flask through a short column at a fairly rapid rate. The first runnings may contain a little water and can be further dried. The product is a colorless liquid with an odor resembling that of benzene. The yield of fluorobenzene boiling at 84\u201385\u00b0 is 780\u2013870 g. (51\u201357 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 10)."

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 165 g. (1 mole) of ethyl p-aminobenzoate (Note 1), 300 cc. of water, and 204 cc. (2.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This mixture is warmed on a steam bath for an hour with occasional shaking. The flask containing the resulting white paste of p-carbethoxyaniline hydrochloride is placed in an ice-salt bath and cooled to 0\u00b0. The mixture is stirred mechanically, and a solution of 72.6 g. (1 mole) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in a minimum quantity of water is run in slowly while the temperature is kept below 7\u00b0. The diazotization is complete when a faint positive test for nitrous acid with starch-iodide paper persists for ten minutes.\nWhile the diazotization is in process, 68 g. (1.1 moles) of boric acid is dissolved in 133 g. (4 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid (Note 2) in a beaker coated with paraffin-wax. The temperature is kept below 25\u00b0 during the addition to avoid melting the paraffin-wax, and, after the addition, the solution is chilled in an ice-water bath.\nThe ice-cold fluoboric acid solution is added rather rapidly, with stirring, to the diazonium solution while the temperature is kept below 10\u00b0. A thick paste of p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate precipitates; stirring is continued for twenty to thirty minutes. The solid is filtered on an 18.5-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed consecutively with 300 cc. of cold water, 300 cc. of commercial methyl alcohol, and 200 cc. of commercial ether; it is sucked as dry as possible between washings. The fluoborate is then dried over concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in a vacuum desiccator (Note 3). The yield of the dried fluoborate is 198\u2013205 g. (75\u201378 per cent of the theoretical amount); the decomposition point is 93\u201394\u00b0.\nThe thermal decomposition may be conveniently carried out in a 2-l. distilling flask. A second distilling flask of 1-l. capacity is connected directly to the side arm of the first to serve as a receiver. Attached to the side arm of the receiver is a rubber tube arranged to lead the escaping gases over 2 l. of water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The boron trifluoride dissolves in the water, and the other gases are led into a good hood (Note 4). The p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate is placed in the decomposition flask and heated at its upper edge with a Bunsen flame. When the white fumes of boron trifluoride commence to appear, the flame is removed and the decomposition is permitted to proceed spontaneously. The heat is applied as necessary, and finally the flask is strongly heated to complete the decomposition and melt the solid. Some of the ethyl ester, b.p. 105\u2013106\u00b0/25 mm., of p-fluorobenzoic acid is collected in the receiver, where it is carried by the gases, but the larger part is left in the decomposition flask. The ester is washed from the decomposition flask and the receiver with ether, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is refluxed for one hour on a steam bath with a solution of 56 g. (1 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 80 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 120 cc. of water. The solution is then filtered while still hot. The p-fluorobenzoic acid is precipitated by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid to the hot filtrate until the mixture is acid to Congo paper. After the mixture has cooled, the solid is filtered and allowed to dry. For purification, the p-fluorobenzoic acid is dissolved in a hot solution of 40 g. of potassium carbonate in 400 cc. of water; the solution is treated with Norite and filtered hot. Hydrochloric acid is added with stirring to precipitate the fluorobenzoic acid, which is then cooled, filtered, and dried.\nWhen 85 g. (0.32 mole) of p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate is thus decomposed, there is obtained 38\u201340 g. of p-fluorobenzoic acid (84\u201389 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the fluoborate; 63\u201369 per cent based on the ester of p-aminobenzoic acid). The melting point of the purified acid is 186\u00b0. The crude acid melts at 183\u2013184\u00b0."

            "This preparation must be carried out in a hood having good suction. Methyl sulfate has a high vapor pressure in spite of its high boiling point and is very poisonous. Ammonia is a specific antidote and should be kept on hand to destroy any of the ester accidentally spilled. It is advisable to wash the hands in dilute ammonium hydroxide frequently.\nIn a 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer for reading low temperatures (Note 1), and a dropping funnel, are placed 98 g. (2 moles) of pulverized sodium cyanide (Note 2) and 200 cc. of water. The stirrer is started, and 60 g. of paraformaldehyde (2 moles) (Note 3) is added in small quantities until the temperature rises to 20\u201325\u00b0 and the sodium cyanide has dissolved. The flask is then surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the temperature is kept below 25\u00b0 during the introduction of the remaining paraformaldehyde.\nTwo hundred cubic centimeters (270 g., 2.1 moles) of technical methyl sulfate is placed in the dropping funnel, and, when the temperature inside the flask has dropped to 13\u00b0, a 20- to 30-cc. portion of the sulfate is added. An exothermic reaction should set in; the ice bath is removed, if necessary, to get the reaction to start (Note 4). When the temperature begins to fall, the remainder of the methyl sulfate is admitted at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 12\u201315\u00b0; this takes at least twenty minutes. When the addition is complete the mixture is stirred an additional forty minutes; during this time the temperature will drop to about 5\u00b0. The stirrer is stopped, and the oily, upper layer is separated at once (Note 5). The lower, aqueous layer is returned to the flask and methylated as before with a second 200-cc. portion of methyl sulfate (Note 6).\nThe oily, upper layer is dried with 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 7) and is distilled under diminished pressure. For this purpose an efficient fractionating column (Note 8) is used. The portion boiling below 70\u00b0 at 15 mm. is mainly methoxyacetonitrile and weighs 60\u201370 g. The upper layer from the second methylation is treated in a similar manner; the distillate weighs 55\u201360 g. The residue in the distilling flask is methyl sulfate and is used in a subsequent run (Note 9).\nThe crude fractions are combined and distilled at atmospheric pressure through a good column; about 95 per cent distils at 118\u2013122\u00b0 as a colorless liquid. The methoxyacetonitrile so prepared weighs 100\u2013110 g. (70\u201377 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "Iodine is slowly washed by means of condensed liquid into a mixture of methyl alcohol and phosphorus. The apparatus employed by the submitter, Fig. 14, is rendered more flexible by the use of a three-necked flask, as shown in Fig. 15, and a further improvement is in the provision of a side tube for the addition of iodine to the separatory funnel, A (Note 1). In the following description reference is made to the simpler apparatus, Fig. 14; the changes required for the modified assembly will be obvious.\nFig. 14\nFig. 15\nThe cylindrical separatory funnel A has a volume of 1.2 l. and holds 2 kg. (15.75 gram atoms) of iodine crystals (Note 2). A piece of perforated platinum foil B, or a loose plug of glass wool, is placed in the bottom to prevent clogging of the stopcock by iodine crystals or solid impurities. Stopcock C is as large as 5 mm. in bore as a further precaution. For producing up to 4 kg. of methyl iodide, a 5-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask D is used (Note 3). It is partly submerged in a water bath. Tube E, fitted into the reaction flask by a rubber stopper, is at least 2.5 cm. in internal diameter in order to allow the vapor to rise without interrupting the return of the excess distillate. Tube F is 4 cm. in diameter to allow for preliminary condensation. A space (13 cm.) is left above stopcock G as a reservoir for the distillate. Stopcock G has a bore of 2 or 3 mm. (Note 4). The bottom of the tube from this stopcock is flush with the bottom of the rubber stopper to the iodine container, so that the liquid will flow down the sides of the container instead of forming a channel through the middle of the iodine. Condenser H, 2.5 cm. in diameter and at least 200 cm. long, is attached by a rubber stopper and is well cooled with a strong stream of water (Note 5) and (Note 6).\nIn container A is placed 2 kg. of iodine, no crystals being allowed to fall below the platinum foil or glass wool. The iodine is covered with part of 2 l. (50 moles) of methanol (Note 7), the rest of which is added to 200 g. each of red and yellow phosphorus (12.8 gram atoms) in reaction flask D. The apparatus is assembled as illustrated in Fig. 14. The water bath is heated to 70\u201375\u00b0; stopcock G is opened wide and stopcock C part way to allow the solution of iodine to flow slowly into the reaction flask. By the time all the alcohol has been added, enough methyl iodide will have been formed to start the refluxing. Stopcock C is then opened wide and stopcock G partly closed so that only a small stream of methyl iodide flows through the iodine container. The temperature is adjusted so that little of the reflux flows back through tube E. This will require the progressive lowering of the temperature of the water bath as the reaction proceeds (Note 8); a temperature of about 55\u00b0 is sufficient to promote even boiling after the first portion of iodine has been introduced. If for any reason refluxing becomes too violent, both stopcocks are closed. When the reaction has been brought under control, stopcock G is partly opened and then stopcock C part way, until any liquid in A has run out, after which C is opened wide. When all the iodine has been extracted (about two and one-half hours) both stopcocks are closed, the separatory funnel is lowered with a rotary motion, filled with a second charge of 2 kg. (15.75 gram atoms) of iodine, and raised to its former position. Stopcock C is opened wide and stopcock G part way as before.\nAfter the extraction of this second charge of iodine, the flask is cooled, and a condenser arranged for downward distillation is fitted in place of the special apparatus. To the lower end of the condenser is tightly attached an adapter dipping under a slush of ice and water. When all the methyl iodide has distilled (b.p. 40\u201342.5\u00b0) (Note 9), it is separated from the water, dried by shaking with anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered through glass wool, stored for use in a sealed flask or tubes, and kept in the dark (Note 10). The yield is 4150\u20134250 g. (93\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount based on iodine), and the crude product is colorless and sufficiently pure for many purposes. Redistillation gives, with a 95 per cent recovery, a product boiling at 41.0\u201342.0\u00b0. Because of the high vapor pressure of methyl iodide, special precautions should be taken to prevent loss of material. Two different devices that have been found satisfactory are described in (Note 11) and (Note 12).\nThe discoloration of purified methyl iodide is greatly retarded by the addition of a drop of mercury, and traces of iodine in an old sample may be removed by shaking with mercury (Note 13). A very highly colored product is best washed with very dilute sodium thiosulfate, then with water, before drying.\nWith minor modifications, this method is suitable for the preparation of ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-amyl, isobutyl, and isoamyl iodides with yields of more than 90 per cent. A somewhat lower yield is obtained in the preparation of sec.-butyl iodide owing to the formation of hydrogen iodide.",
            "A 3-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer, a separatory funnel, a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a small fractionating column connected with an efficient condenser set for downward distillation. The condenser leads to a receiving vessel cooled in ice water (Note 1). A solution of 800 g. (4.8 moles) of u.s.p. potassium iodide in 430 cc. of water is placed in the flask, 60 g. of calcium carbonate is added, and the mixture is heated to 60\u201365\u00b0, with stirring.\nThe temperature is kept at 60\u201365\u00b0, and 630 g. (473 cc., 5 moles) of \"practical\" methyl sulfate (Note 2) is added gradually through the separatory funnel. The rate of addition is such that the methyl iodide distils briskly; the addition requires about two hours.\nAfter all the methyl sulfate has been added, the temperature is raised to 65\u201370\u00b0 for about forty minutes to complete the distillation of the methyl iodide. The product is separated from a small amount of water, dried thoroughly over anhydrous calcium chloride, and decanted into a dry distilling flask. A few crystals of potassium iodide are added, and the material is distilled from a water bath. The yield of methyl iodide, boiling at 41\u201343\u00b0, is 615\u2013640 g. (90\u201394 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3)."

The temperature is maintained between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 by external cooling or by the addition of finely crushed ice. When all the acid solution has been added (about one and one-half to two hours is required, depending upon the rate of cooling) the mixture is stirred for an hour longer at room temperature and then warmed to 80\u00b0 on the steam bath. The hot solution is filtered from the unreacted zinc, which is washed with three 100-cc. portions of a warm 5 per cent hydrochloric acid solution. The combined filtrate and washings are cooled and treated with sufficient 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to redissolve the zinc hydroxide precipitated. (About 1.2 l. is required.) The oily layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted with two or three 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined oil and extracts are distilled from a steam bath until the ether is removed; the residue is then distilled under reduced pressure.

(103 cc., 2 moles) of bromine is slowly added with stirring during about two hours (Note 1). The stirring is continued for a few minutes until the bromine color has disappeared (Note 2).\nTo the reaction flask containing the crude trimethylethylene dibromide is added 540 cc. of water, and the flask is fitted with a long reflux condenser and a mercury-sealed stirrer (Note 3). The mixture is refluxed with stirring for three to five hours until hydrolysis is practically complete (Note 4). The reflux condenser is then replaced by a condenser for distillation, and the crude methyl isopropyl ketone is removed from the reaction mixture by direct distillation, with stirring, until the temperature rises (Note 5) and the oil nearly stops coming over (about one and one-half hours), or until the oil coming over is heavier than water. The residue in the flask can be distilled to yield about 380 cc. of constant-boiling hydrobromic acid.\nTo the distillate, consisting of a yellow oil with a small lower water layer, powdered sodium carbonate (about 10 g.) is added, and the mixture is shaken until the water layer is alkaline and nearly saturated (Note 6). The layers are separated, and the oil is refluxed for about sixteen hours with 20 g. of powdered potassium carbonate and 5 cc. of water (Note 7). The oily layer is again separated and dried over about 6 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride or potassium carbonate (Note 8). It is then placed in a flask containing 2 g. of dry sodium carbonate and distilled through an efficient column. The yield of methyl isopropyl ketone boiling at 92\u201394\u00b0 (Note 9) is about 102 g. (59 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is slightly yellow."

(1.62 moles) of \u03b2-acetylaminonaphthalene (m.p. 131\u2013132\u00b0) and 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. With the mixture at room temperature, the stirrer is set in motion, and 200 g. (143 cc., 2.1 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) is added dropwise over a period of forty-five minutes; the temperature is kept below 40\u00b0 by occasionally immersing the flask in the cooling bath. When about one-tenth of the nitric acid has been added, the reaction mixture sets to a mass that is stirred with difficulty. The addition of nitric acid is stopped at this point. After three to five minutes the mass becomes fluid, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed. When about one-fourth of the nitric acid has been added, all the solid material dissolves. Considerable heat is evolved at this point, and good cooling is required to keep the temperature from rising above 40\u00b0; the mixture must be cooled during the addition of the remainder of the acid. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer.\nThe flask is stoppered and cooled in a bath of ice and water for three hours; the reaction product should then separate in the form of a yellow, crystalline paste (Note 1) and (Note 2). The crystals are collected on a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed, first with 200 cc. of 50 per cent acetic acid, and next with 400 cc. of ordinary ether. This crude, dry product, weighing 270\u2013290 g., is placed in a 3-l. flask and heated under a reflux condenser with 1.7 l. of benzene for twenty minutes. The mixture is then allowed to cool to 40\u201345\u00b0 and filtered through a 19-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel.

The temperature is brought to 50\u00b0, and 80 cc. (1.3 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is added with stirring in the course of fifteen minutes. During the addition, the solution becomes slightly yellow, and a small amount of material precipitates. The water bath is slowly brought to 60\u201365\u00b0, when the precipitate dissolves and the color of the solution deepens. Stirring is continued, and heat is applied continuously until the temperature of the mixture reaches 80\u00b0 (Note 2). After five minutes, the water bath is removed, and the mixture, which now consists of a semi-solid paste of fine, yellow needles, is allowed to cool to room temperature during two hours. The product is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, sucked as dry as possible, and washed with two 25-cc. portions of cold glacial acetic acid containing 0.5 g. of potassium acetate. It is then washed several times with water and dried. The 2-nitrofluorene so obtained melts at 155\u2013156\u00b0 and is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The yield is 60 g. (79 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nIf a purer product is desired, the above material may be crystallized from 200 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The purified product melts at 157\u00b0 and weighs 56 g.\n(B) 2-Aminofluorene.\u2014In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, 30 g. (0.14 mole) of dried and powdered 2-nitrofluorene is made into a thin paste with 1 l. of 78 per cent alcohol (820 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and 180 cc. of water). A solution of 10 g. of calcium chloride in 15 cc. of water, together with 300 g. of zinc dust, is added to the suspension, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. The flask is fitted with an effective reflux condenser, and the mixture is refluxed for two hours.\nThe sludge of zinc dust and zinc oxide is filtered from the boiling solution and extracted (Note 3) with 50 cc. of boiling 78 per cent alcohol. The combined filtrates are then poured into 2 l. of water, whereupon a white, flocculent precipitate is obtained. This is filtered with suction and recrystallized from 400 cc. of hot 50 per cent alcohol. The purified 2-aminofluorene crystallizes in needles melting at 127.5\u00b0. The yield is 20\u201321 g.

            "In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer (Note 1), and a 100-cc. dropping funnel, are placed 374 g. (2.8 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 400 cc. of carbon bisulfide (Note 2). To the stirred suspension is added slowly through the dropping funnel 375 g. (2.5 moles) of phenyl propionate (Note 3). Reaction sets in almost at once with the evolution of hydrogen chloride (Note 4), and the carbon bisulfide begins to reflux from the heat of reaction (Note 5). When all the propionate is in (one and one-half hours is required), the mixture is further heated to gentle refluxing on a steam bath until the evolution of hydrogen chloride has practically ceased (about two hours). The reflux condenser is then turned downward, and the carbon bisulfide is distilled. The steam bath is replaced by an oil bath which is heated to 140\u00b0 and maintained at 140\u2013150\u00b0 for three hours (Note 6). During this period a fresh evolution of hydrogen chloride takes place. The mixture thickens and finally congeals to a brown resinous mass. Stirring is continued as long as possible (Note 7).\nThe solid is then allowed to cool, and the aluminum complex is decomposed by slowly adding first a mixture of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid with 300 cc. of water and then 500 cc. of water (Note 8), whereupon a black oil collects at the surface. After standing overnight in the ice box, a large portion of this layer solidifies and can be separated by filtration. This solid (p-propiophenol) is recrystallized from 400 cc. of methyl alcohol. The yield is 129\u2013148 g. (34\u201339 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a light yellow product melting at 145\u2013147\u00b0. A second recrystallization raises the melting point to 147\u2013148\u00b0.\nThe oily filtrate combined with the concentrated mother liquors of the above recrystallization is dissolved in 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide and extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether to remove non-phenolic products. The alkaline solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and the oily layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled. The o-propiophenol boils at 110\u2013115\u00b0/6 mm. The yield is 120\u2013132 g. (32\u201335 per cent of the theoretical amount). About 40 g. of p-propiophenol boiling at 135\u2013150\u00b0/11 mm. is obtained. The total yield of crude p-propiophenol is thus 169\u2013188 g. (45\u201350 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 9)."

            "The apparatus consists of a 12-l. round-bottomed flask and a 250-cc. suction flask provided with stoppers and glass tubes as shown in Fig. 19. After the flasks have been charged, A is surrounded by an ice bath and B by a water bath heated to 40\u201350\u00b0. In flask A are placed 100 g. (1.1 moles) of aniline, 1 l. of water, and 100 cc. (1.2 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid; when the aniline has dissolved, sufficient water is added to bring the volume of the solution to 5 l. Flask B is charged with 577 g. (185 cc., 3.6 moles) of bromine; the baths are adjusted, and a rapid stream of air saturated with bromine vapor is drawn into A by applying suction at C (Note 1) and (Note 2).\nFig. 19\nThe introduction of bromine is continued until the solution assumes a distinctly yellow color; approximately three to four hours is required, and the reaction is then complete. The tribromoaniline is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, thoroughly washed with water to remove hydrobromic acid, sucked as dry as possible, and taken without further drying to the next step.\nThe moist tribromoaniline, together with 2.1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol and 525 cc. of benzene, is placed in a 5-l. two-necked flask. One neck of the flask bears a reflux condenser; the other is closed with a stopper that can be removed momentarily for the addition of reagents. The tribromoaniline is brought into solution by heating the flask on a steam bath. To this solution is added 140 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and then 140 g. (2.03 moles) of powdered sodium nitrite as rapidly as the violence of the reaction will permit. When the reaction has moderated, the solution is brought to boiling and maintained there as long as gas is evolved. It is then allowed to stand in a warm place for three hours more.\nAfter the mixture has been cooled (preferably in an ice bath), the mother liquor is removed from the solid by decantation through a B\u00fcchner funnel; if necessary, a wire gauze is used to retain the solid in the flask. To the solid is then added a solution of 150 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.5 l. of water. When the excess sodium nitrite has been decomposed, the solid is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed first with water and then with a small amount of alcohol. The yield of crude, dry tribromobenzene is 250\u2013260 g. (74\u201377 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is reddish brown and melts at 112\u2013116\u00b0.\nFor further purification, 100 g. of the crude product is dissolved in a boiling mixture of 1560 cc. of glacial acetic acid and 350 cc. of water; the solution is boiled for a few minutes with 25 g. of decolorizing carbon, filtered hot, and allowed to cool. The crystals are washed on a B\u00fcchner funnel with a small amount of chilled 95 per cent alcohol to remove the acetic acid. The whole of the crude product crystallized in this way furnishes 216\u2013240 g. (64\u201371 per cent of the theoretical amount) of slightly colored tribromobenzene, melting at 121.5\u2013122.5\u00b0 (corr.).\nThe yield of crude product may be increased 50\u201360 g.\u2014making a total of 300\u2013320 g. (89\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount)\u2014by working up the mother liquors. The alcoholic liquors and washings are diluted to 6 l., and the aqueous layer is separated from the heavy oil at the bottom. The benzene is then distilled from the oil in a distilling flask, care being taken not to overheat the product after the benzene has been removed. The residual tribromobenzene may be recrystallized in the manner described above."

Boiling and stirring are maintained for five hours.\nThe mixture is cooled to room temperature, the flask is filled two-thirds full with water, and stirring is continued for five minutes. The xylene solution is separated, washed with water, dried over calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure. After removal of the solvent, the tricarbomethoxymethane distils at 128\u2013142\u00b0/18 mm. The yield of crude product is 50\u201351 g. (50\u201351 per cent of the theoretical amount).

The flask is now fitted with a reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, and 250-cc. separatory funnel.\nHeating is continued on a steam bath, and 189 g. (142 cc.) of methyl sulfate (Note 3) is added through the separatory funnel just rapidly enough to maintain the gentle ebullition which starts after the addition of the first 10\u201315 cc. (Note 4). After the addition of all the methyl sulfate, which requires about one hour, the reaction mixture is heated for forty-five minutes longer and an additional portion of 39 g. (30 cc.) of methyl sulfate is added at the same rate as the first portion. At the end of this addition the reaction mixture should show an acid reaction to litmus (Note 5). After ten minutes' heating the reaction mixture is rendered slightly alkaline by the addition of about 60 cc. of the sodium hydroxide solution (prepared above), and another 39-g. portion of methyl sulfate is added. The alternate addition of sodium hydroxide solution and of methyl sulfate (39-g. portions) is repeated twice more, so that a total of 345 g. (2.7 moles) of methyl sulfate is added. The reaction mixture is then made strongly alkaline by the addition of 150 cc. of the sodium hydroxide solution and is heated for twenty minutes after the last addition of methyl sulfate. The reaction mixture is cooled rapidly to 25\u00b0 (Note 6) with continued stirring, and the veratraldehyde is extracted with three 300-cc. portions of ether.\nThe combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the ether is distilled. There remains a slightly yellow oil which soon solidifies. The yield is 164\u2013173 g. (82\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount) of veratraldehyde melting at 43\u201344.5\u00b0. This product is sufficiently pure for many purposes, but it can be purified further with slight loss by distillation under diminished pressure. From 164 g. of the above product there is obtained 156 g. of pure veratraldehyde, boiling at 153\u00b0/8 mm. and melting at 46\u00b0 (Note 7). Since this aldehyde is easily oxidized in the air it should be stored in a tightly corked or sealed container."

(850 cc., 11 moles) of isopropyl alcohol (Note 3) in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is warmed to 45\u00b0. The flask is closed with a tight cork firmly wired or tied in place, and is supported in an inverted position in a tripod and exposed to direct sunlight. After three to five hours of bright sunshine crystals of benzopinacol begin to appear; after eight or ten days of exposure, depending upon the intensity of the light (Note 4), the flask is filled with crystals of benzopinacol. The solution is chilled in ice and the crystalline product is filtered with suction, washed with a small quantity of isopropyl alcohol, and allowed to dry in the air. The filtrate is reserved for subsequent reductions (see below). The yield of practically pure benzopinacol, m.p. 188\u2013190\u00b0 (Note 5), is 141\u2013142 g. (93\u201394 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is sufficiently pure for most purposes. It may be crystallized by dissolving it in 1 l. of hot benzene, filtering, and adding 400 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0) to the hot filtrate. After cooling in ice and filtering there is obtained 129\u2013130 g. of purified product. The melting point is not changed by this purification.\nTo the isopropyl alcohol filtrate is added another 150-g. portion of benzophenone, and the solution is exposed to sunlight as in the first reduction. The benzopinacol which separates is filtered and dried. The yield in the second and subsequent runs is 142\u2013143 g. (94\u201395 per cent of the calculated amount). This procedure can be repeated with the same filtrate until six or seven portions (900\u20131050 g.) of benzophenone have been reduced."

            "In a 3-l. three-necked flask is placed a mixture of 94 g. (1 mole) of phenol and 350 g. (190 cc., 3.5 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the mixture is heated on a boiling water bath for three hours with constant mechanical stirring. At the end of this time the boiling water bath is replaced by an ice bath. When the reaction mixture has been cooled to room temperature it is made alkaline by the careful addition of a solution of 280 g. (7 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water (Note 1). This must be done slowly and with good cooling to prevent boiling. A solid salt, which at first separates, largely dissolves at a later stage.\nThe alkaline solution is cooled to room temperature; with the stirrer still in constant operation, and after inserting a thermometer, 160 g. (1 mole) of bromine is added from a dropping funnel in the course of twenty to thirty minutes. During this operation the temperature is allowed to rise to 40\u201350\u00b0. Stirring is continued for one-half hour after all the bromine has been added. The solution should still be alkaline and should contain only a small amount of suspended material.\nIn order to evaporate the solution, the flask is then placed in an oil bath, which is brought to a temperature of 150\u2013155\u00b0. As soon as solid material begins to separate, the mixture will bump badly unless a rather rapid current of air is passed through the reaction mixture. This has the further advantage of hastening the evaporation (Note 2). The heating is continued until a thick, pasty, gray mass is left as a residue, the process requiring thirty to forty minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool and then made strongly acid by the addition of 800 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. This must be done slowly and under a hood on account of the rapid evolution of hydrogen bromide.\nThe flask is then heated in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 190\u2013210\u00b0 and the mixture is distilled with steam. The sulfonate groups are hydrolyzed in this process, and the bromophenol passes over as a heavy, colorless or pale yellow oil. In about one hour the distillate is clear. The product is extracted with ether, the ether is removed by distillation from the steam bath, and the residue is distilled at atmospheric pressure (Note 3). The fraction boiling at 194\u2013200\u00b0 represents practically pure o-bromophenol. The yield is 70\u201375 g. (40\u201343 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4). o-Bromophenol is a colorless liquid with a very characteristic odor. It is rather unstable and decomposes on standing, becoming brown or red in color."

(3 gram atoms) of sodium in large pieces in one lot. The somewhat vigorous reaction is easily kept under control by immersing the entire flask in a mixture of crushed ice and water. In a short time the reaction has subsided somewhat; the flask is then removed from the cooling mixture, and the reaction is allowed to proceed without external cooling. Reduction is completed by heating the mixture on a steam bath until all the sodium has dissolved. The partly cooled mixture is diluted with 300 cc. of water and heated on the steam bath until no more alcohol distils. The remaining small amount of alcohol is removed by gently applying suction from a water pump. The residue is diluted with about 600 cc. of hot water, and the mixture is allowed to cool without being disturbed. The separated oil solidifies to a solid cake from which the lower aqueous layer is easily decanted. The solid is washed once with a little cold water, drained as completely as possible, and dried by heating in the flask on a steam bath under reduced pressure. The residue is extracted with four successive 250-cc. portions of hot benzene. The united extract is clarified with a little charcoal, filtered, and concentrated to a volume of about 60 cc.

Heating is then continued for eight hours more. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool, and a solution of 230 g. of sodium hydroxide in 350 cc. of water is added fairly rapidly with constant shaking. Two layers form immediately, and sodium chloride is precipitated. The latter is dissolved by the addition of 400 cc. of water, and then 500 cc. of benzene is added and the mixture is stirred mechanically for five minutes. The benzene layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted three times more, 500 cc. of benzene being used for each extraction. The combined benzene extracts are dried over about 100 g. of solid potassium carbonate, with mechanical stirring until the turbidity of the solution has disappeared.

            "To 500 g. (3.85 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate in a 1-l. flask, set in ice and well cooled, are added 152 g. (2 moles) of 40 per cent aqueous formaldehyde solution and 20\u201325 drops of diethylamine. The flask and contents are kept cold for six hours and are then allowed to stand at room temperature for forty to forty-five hours. At the end of this time two layers are present, a lower oily layer and an upper aqueous layer. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 50 cc. of ether. The ether solution is added to the oily layer, and the resulting solution is dried over 30 g. of calcium chloride. The ether is then removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, amounting to approximately 500 g., is diluted with an equal volume of alcohol and is thoroughly cooled in an ice bath. Ammonia is then passed into the mixture until the solution is saturated. This requires from four to eight hours, and during this time the flask is kept packed in ice. The ammoniacal alcoholic solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for forty to forty-five hours. Most of the alcohol is now evaporated; the residue is cooled, and the solid 1,4-dihydro-3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine is removed from the remaining alcohol on a suction filter. The dried ester melts at 175\u2013180\u00b0 and weighs 410\u2013435 g. (84\u201389 per cent of the theoretical amount).",
            "To 200 g. (0.79 mole) of the ester in a 5-l. flask is added a mixture of 270 g. of water, 72 g. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42), and 78 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is then very cautiously heated, and the contents are kept in a swirling motion by a slow shaking of the flask by hand. The oxidation is accompanied by considerable foaming if the heating is too rapid, part of the reaction mixture may be lost by excessive frothing. After the foaming has subsided, the reaction mixture is again warmed cautiously until the liquid assumes a deep red color. The entire oxidation is carried out in ten to fifteen minutes. After the liquid has ceased boiling, it is treated with 500 cc. of water and 500 g. of finely chopped ice. The resulting solution is made strongly alkaline by the gradual addition of ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90). The precipitated 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine is filtered with suction, dried on a porous plate, and then distilled (Note 1). The yield of product boiling at 170\u2013172\u00b0/8 mm. is 115\u2013130 g. (58\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the dihydro ester).",
            "A solution of 130 g. (0.52 mole) of this ester in 400 cc. of ethyl alcohol is placed in a two-necked 2-l. flask, carrying a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser, and is heated to boiling. Then one-third of a solution (Note 2) of 78.5 g. (1.4 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 400 cc. of alcohol is added from the dropping funnel, and the alcoholic solution is boiled until it becomes clear. Then a second third of the alkali solution is added, and the reaction mixture is again boiled until any precipitate disappears. Finally, the last third of the alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution is added. The addition of the alkali requires about twenty minutes. The reaction mixture is then boiled for forty minutes longer.\nThe contents of the flask while still hot are poured into a 30-cm. evaporating dish and the alcohol is evaporated on a steam bath. The dry salt is pulverized and thoroughly mixed with 390 g. of calcium oxide, placed in a 2-l. copper retort (Note 3), and heated with the full flame of a Meker burner. The distillate is placed in a distilling flask and heated on a steam bath; all material distilling under 90\u00b0 is removed and discarded. The residue is then allowed to stand over solid potassium hydroxide for twelve hours and is finally fractionated. The dimethylpyridine distils at 142\u2013144\u00b0/743 mm. The yield is 35\u201336 g. (63\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine, or 30\u201336 per cent based on the original ethyl acetoacetate)."

The benzene is heated to boiling on a steam bath, the steam is turned off, and 500 g. (3.96 moles) of benzyl chloride is added at such a rate as to cause the solution to boil (Note 2). The hydrogen chloride is absorbed in water or allowed to pass out-of-doors. When all the benzyl chloride has been added (one hour), the mixture is warmed for ten to fifteen minutes, or until the evolution of hydrogen chloride ceases. When cool, the benzene solution of diphenylmethane is decanted from the small amount of tarry material (Note 3) and washed with 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and then with water. After a partial drying with calcium chloride, the benzene is distilled from a steam bath and the residue fractionated under diminished pressure.

The reaction begins at once as evidenced by the evolution of hydrogen chloride and the separation of a yellow viscous aluminum chloride complex. When all the sulfur chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is removed from the ice bath, stirred at room temperature for two hours, and then heated at 30\u00b0 until practically no hydrogen chloride is evolved (one hour). The mixture is then poured on 1 kg. of cracked ice, and, when hydrolysis is complete, the benzene layer is separated from the water layer by means of a separatory funnel.

(17.4 moles) of glycerol is thoroughly mixed with 200 g. (6.5 gram atoms) of red phosphorus (Note 1). Nine hundred cubic centimeters (2808 g., 17.5 moles) of bromine (Note 2) is then gradually added, with effective stirring (Note 3), through the dropping funnel in the course of about eight hours. To minimize the escape of bromine, the end of the dropping funnel should reach almost to the bottom of the flask. The by-product gases, consisting mainly of hydrogen bromide and some bromine, are led over concentrated sodium hydroxide solution or to a gas trap. The reaction is exothermic, and the temperature quickly rises to 80\u2013100\u00b0; then the addition of bromine is so regulated that this temperature is maintained. Toward the end of the period of addition of bromine, the flask is placed in a water bath at 70\u201375\u00b0. After all the bromine has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand overnight and is then warmed on the water bath until all the bromine is consumed (one to two hours).\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a two-holed rubber stopper carrying a wide delivery tube and a capillary tube. The flask is heated in an oil bath, and distillation is begun under the reduced pressure of a water pump. The receiver is cooled with water. At first a mixture of hydrobromic acid and water passes over; later the dibromohydrin distils. The temperature of the bath is raised as fast as the boiling of the mass permits, and is eventually brought to 180\u00b0. The distillation is carefully watched at the end and immediately interrupted at the first sign of decomposition. This is clearly indicated by gas formation, in consequence of which the vacuum cannot be maintained at the previous level. To the straw-yellow distillate a slight excess of solid sodium bicarbonate is added with continuous shaking until effervescence ceases. The inorganic salts are removed by filtration, and the aqueous layer of the filtrate is separated from the crude dibromohydrin. The latter is purified by fractional distillation under reduced pressure from a 2-l. Claisen flask. The distillation is continued until no more water passes over and the inside temperature reaches 100\u00b0. Then the dibromohydrin is separated from the water in the distillate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and poured back into the distilling flask. By this operation the water is largely removed (Note 4). Then the distillation is continued as before and, after a small fore-run, the dibromohydrin boils at 110\u2013112\u00b0 under 20 mm. pressure (Note 5). The yield is 2000\u20132050 g. (52\u201354 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless product.\nThe dibromohydrin is a heavy, colorless liquid with a characteristic odor. On standing it gradually becomes yellow. Its specific gravity at 20\u00b0 is about 2.14."

            "Sixty grams (0.43 mole) of potassium carbonate (Note 1) is slowly stirred into a mixture of 100 g. (0.725 mole) of u.s.p. salicylic acid and 150 cc. of water contained in a 20-cm. porcelain dish. The solution is evaporated on a steam bath until a thick, pasty residue is obtained. This is broken up into small pieces and dried in an oven at 105\u2013110\u00b0 for two hours. The solid is then ground as finely as possible, dried for another two hours at 105\u2013110\u00b0, and again ground to a fine powder.\nThe finely powdered mixture of potassium salicylate and carbonate is placed in a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask which is immersed in an oil bath so that only a small portion of the neck protrudes from the bath (Note 2). The bath is heated to 240\u00b0 (Note 3) and maintained at this temperature for one and one-half hours. During this time the solid in the flask is stirred occasionally with a curved glass rod flattened at the end.\nWhen the reaction is completed (Note 4), the product is transferred as completely as possible, while hot, to a 2-l. flask containing 1 l. of hot water. The reaction flask is rinsed with several portions of the hot solution. The alkaline solution is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 75 cc. is required), heated nearly to boiling, treated with 5\u20136 g. of decolorizing charcoal, and filtered to remove a small quantity of brown resin. The filtrate is cooled under the tap, and the crude brown crystalline product is filtered with suction. The filtrate is concentrated to a volume of approximately 300 cc. and cooled as before. The second crop of crude acid is filtered with suction and combined with the main portion. The total weight of crude p-hydroxybenzoic acid, m.p. 208\u2013211\u00b0, is 40\u201345 g.\nThe crude acid is dissolved in 300 cc. of hot water, boiled with 4\u20135 g. of decolorizing charcoal for a few minutes, and the solution filtered. After cooling thoroughly under the tap the purified product is filtered with suction and washed with 10\u201315 cc. of cold water. The purified acid weighs 35\u201340 g.

            "A 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a stopcock, and a long condenser. The end of the condenser is connected with the following assembly: a safety trap, consisting of an empty gas-washing bottle; a second wash bottle containing 100 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid (1 volume of concentrated sulfuric acid to 2 volumes of water); a tower, about 30 cm. high, containing calcium chloride; an empty 2-l. flask which acts as a trap; a 2-l. flask containing 80.5 g. (3.5 gram atoms) of clean sodium dissolved in 1.5 l. of absolute alcohol; an empty 1-l. flask and a 1-l. flask containing 500 cc. of a saturated solution of lead acetate (Note 1). The exit tube from this last flask leads to a suction pump.\nAfter 556 g. (2 moles) of methyl isothiourea sulfate (p. 411) is placed in the three-necked flask, a very slow current of air is drawn through the apparatus by means of the suction pump while 800 cc. of cold 5 N sodium hydroxide is added to the methyl isothiourea sulfate through the dropping funnel. The mixture is warmed very slowly to generate the methyl mercaptan (Note 2). As the reaction nears completion (after about two hours), the mixture is heated strongly for about thirty minutes (Note 3).\nThe solution of sodium methyl sulfide in absolute alcohol is transferred to a 3-l. three-necked flask, which is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a mechanical stirrer. The solution is heated until the alcohol begins to boil. Heating is then discontinued and 302 g. (3.75 moles) of ethylene chlorohydrin (Note 4) is added dropwise with efficient stirring over a period of about two hours (Note 5). The reaction mixture is concentrated by distilling as much of the alcohol as possible on the steam bath. The mixture is then allowed to cool and the sodium chloride removed by filtration. The flask is rinsed and the sodium chloride washed with three 100-cc. portions of 95 per cent alcohol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure until no further distillate passes over. The residue is then transferred to a modified Claisen flask and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure. The yield is 238\u2013265 g.

(0.41 mole) of ethyl phthalimidomalonate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 271). The mixture is rapidly chilled to 0\u00b0; the crystalline product is filtered at once by suction and washed successively with two 200-cc. portions of absolute alcohol and two 200-cc. portions of ether. After first drying in a vacuum desiccator and then heating for eight hours under 15 mm. pressure in a flask suspended in an oil bath at 145\u2013155\u00b0 (Note 1), the product weighs 108\u2013111 g. (82\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Ethyl 1-Methylthiol-3-phthalimidopropane-3,3-dicarboxylate.\u2014A mixture of 85 g. (0.26 mole) of ethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate and 43 g. (0.39 mole) of \u03b2-chloroethyl methyl sulfide (p. 136) is heated in an oil bath at 160\u2013165\u00b0 in a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a condenser, a thermometer, and a stoppered glass tube for sampling. After one and a half to two hours the mixture is no longer alkaline to litmus. The excess chloroethyl methyl sulfide is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 2), the residual oil is treated with 150 cc. of warm water, and the resulting mixture is transferred to a beaker and chilled. The crystalline material is filtered by suction, washed with 100 cc. of cold water, and recrystallized from the smallest possible quantity of warm absolute alcohol. In this way 75\u201379 g. (76\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a pure product, melting at 66\u201367\u00b0, is obtained.\n(C) 1-Methylthiol-3-phthalamidopropane-3,3-dicarboxylic Acid.\u2014A solution of 25 g. (0.066 mole) of the above ester in 30 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is heated on the steam bath in a 200-cc. round-bottomed flask, and 70 cc. of 5N sodium hydroxide is added. The cloudy liquid is heated until a sample gives a clear solution on dilution with water; this occurs after about two hours. The solution is then chilled to 0\u00b0 and cautiously neutralized to Congo red with 0.2 N hydrochloric acid, whereupon 75 cc. of 5 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added, the temperature being maintained at 0\u00b0. The acid separates as colorless crystals. This separation is completed by the slow addition of 60 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The product is filtered by suction and washed free of salt with small quantities of ice-cold water. After drying in vacuo, the yield is 21.5\u201322 g. (95.5\u201398 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 141\u2013143\u00b0.\n(D) Methionine.\u2014A suspension of 21.5 g. (0.063 mole) of this tricarboxylic acid in 350 cc. of hot water is heated on the steam bath, and 40 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. Carbon dioxide is immediately evolved, and the substance goes into solution. After heating for one and a half hours, 200 cc. more of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and heating is continued for forty-five minutes longer. The solution, on cooling, deposits phthalic acid; this is filtered and washed with two 50-cc. portions of water (Note 3). The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness on the steam bath under reduced pressure, and the dry residue is dissolved in 50 cc. of hot water. The resulting solution is treated with 18 cc. of pyridine and poured into 150 cc. of hot absolute alcohol. Methionine rapidly crystallizes; after cooling it is filtered, washed with alcohol, and dried. The first crop weighs about 6.9 g. The mother liquor is evaporated to dryness; the residue is taken up in 15 cc. of hot water and poured into 50 cc. of absolute alcohol, when a further 1.3 g. is obtained. The total 8.2 g. of nearly pure methionine is suspended in 200 cc. of boiling absolute ether, filtered, and dried. In this way, 7.9\u20138.0 g. of methionine (84\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount), melting at 279\u2013280\u00b0 (corr.), is obtained."

The dark-colored solution is heated rapidly to 70\u201372\u00b0, kept at this temperature for ten minutes, and poured at once onto 3 kg. of cracked ice in a large earthenware crock (preferably in a hood) (Note 3). When the mixture has cooled to room temperature, 600 g. (2.67 moles) of commercial stannous chloride crystals (SnCl2\u00b72H2O) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred thoroughly for ten minutes and then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.\nThe following day the acid liquid is filtered with suction through a large B\u00fcchner funnel, to remove large quantities of humus which are produced. The humus on the filter is washed with two 350-cc. portions of water and finally with two 300-cc. portions of benzene. The filtered liquid and aqueous washings have a volume of approximately 10 l. The 5-methylfurfural is removed from the aqueous layer by extraction with benzene, using three 300-cc. portions of the solvent for each 2 l. of liquid (Note 4). The combined benzene extracts (about 5 l.) are divided into two or three portions; each is washed with two 150-cc. portions of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution and two 100-cc. portions of water. The benzene solution is dried with 100\u2013150 g. of anhydrous magnesium or sodium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation from a 1-l. flask provided with a short fractionating column and a separatory funnel for the continuous introduction of the solution. The distillation is stopped when the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 85\u00b0.\nThe residue is transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask; two small portions of benzene (5\u201310 cc.) are used to rinse the last drops of the residue into the flask. The last traces of benzene are removed by warming gently under reduced pressure, and the 5-methylfurfural is then collected at 83\u201385\u00b0/15 mm. (Note 5). The yield is 63\u201370 g.

The potassium phenoxide is cooled to 100\u2013110\u00b0, and 0.5 g. of copper catalyst (Note 1) and 78.8 g. (0.5 mole) of p-nitrochlorobenzene are added. The flask is then fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a reflux condenser. The stirrer is started, and the contents of the flask are warmed with a Bunsen burner to 150\u2013160\u00b0, at which temperature a spontaneous reaction begins with ebullition and the separation of potassium chloride. The flame should be removed during this stage of the reaction. Boiling nearly ceases within five to seven minutes, and another 78.8 g. (0.5 mole) of p-nitrochlorobenzene is added. The mixture is again heated as before until a second spontaneous reaction begins. This also proceeds for about five minutes without the application of heat. When boiling due to the exothermic reaction has ceased, heat is applied and a temperature of 150\u2013160\u00b0 is maintained for an additional thirty minutes. The dark-colored melt is then poured into 1.5 l. of ice water containing 50 g. of sodium hydroxide and stirred well to remove excess phenol. The crude p-nitrodiphenyl ether separates as a dark brown crystalline mass which is allowed to settle. The product is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 2 l. of water, and pressed as free from water as possible. After drying in the air it is distilled from a 500-cc. Claisen flask. The small fraction boiling up to 170\u00b0/8 mm., which contains p-nitrochlorobenzene, is discarded. A fraction boiling at 170\u2013188\u00b0/8 mm. and weighing 14 g. is collected (Note 2).

The flask is then warmed, with shaking, to 50\u00b0 on a water bath (Note 3) and maintained at that temperature for ten minutes. The cooled reactants are then poured slowly into 800 cc. of ice water and well stirred.

The ethereal extract is added to the residual nitromesitylene, and this ethereal solution is washed with three or four 30-cc. portions of a 10\u201315 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the water extract is distinctly alkaline. The ether is then distilled from a steam bath. The residue, after the addition of about 150 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, is steam-distilled until a test sample of the distillate is clear and free of oil drops. The steam distillation requires about three hours, during which time 1.5 l. of distillate is collected. The nitromesitylene settles to the bottom of the distillate. The water is decanted through a filter paper, and the residue is dissolved in 30 cc. of ether. The filter paper, if it contains any solid particles, is washed with 10 cc. of ether, and the two fractions are combined and placed in a 150-cc. distilling flask with a water-cooled receiver.

The phosgene is purified by bubbling it through cottonseed oil, B, to remove chlorine, and then through concentrated sulfuric acid, C, as shown in the figure (Note 2). A solution of 150 g. (1.09 moles) of p-nitroaniline in 1.5 l. of dry ethyl acetate is run in slowly from the separatory funnel, D, over a period of three to four hours. The addition of the p-nitroaniline solution must be at such a rate that the precipitate of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride that is formed at first is allowed to dissolve and not accumulate (Note 3). During this time a steady stream of phosgene is passed through the solution to ensure an excess (Note 4). Towards the end of the reaction, the solution must be boiled gently with a Bunsen flame to break up the lumps of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride which otherwise dissolve very slowly.\nFig. 16\nAfter the addition of the last of the p-nitroaniline, the stream of phosgene is continued for five minutes and then shut off. The flame under the flask is then turned up and the ethyl acetate distilled. Care must be taken at the end not to overheat the residue. The brown residue (Note 5) is treated with 800 cc. of hot dry carbon tetrachloride, and the insoluble residue (the disubstituted urea) is removed by filtration.\nAbout two-thirds of the carbon tetrachloride is distilled.

            "Eighty-four grams (1 mole) of thiophene (p. 578) is dissolved in 340 cc. of acetic anhydride, and 80 g. (1.2 moles) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.51) is dissolved in 600 cc. of glacial acetic acid (Note 1). Each solution is divided into two equal parts. One-half of the nitric acid solution is introduced into a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, provided with a thermometer, a motor stirrer, and a separatory funnel. The mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0. Then with moderate stirring one-half of the thiophene solution is introduced, drop by drop, and at such a rate as to prevent the heating of the reaction mixture above room temperature. A rapid rise of temperature will occur during the addition of the first fraction of the thiophene solution. In cool weather the temperature is controlled by dipping the nitrating flask into a bath of cold tap water. Cooling to a very low temperature is not necessary, but it is important to avoid superheating the reaction mixture (Note 2). After the addition of the first half of the thiophene, the temperature of the reaction mixture is reduced to 10\u00b0 and the remainder of the nitric acid solution is rapidly introduced into the flask. Nitration is continued by the gradual addition of thiophene. Throughout the nitration the solution should show a permanent light brown color. The appearance of a pink or dark red color indicates oxidation. The product is allowed to remain at room temperature for two hours. It is then treated with an equal weight of finely crushed ice with rapid shaking. Mononitrothiophene separates in pale yellow crystals. More crystals form if the mixture is allowed to remain in the ice chest for twenty-four hours or longer. The solid is filtered (Note 3) on a B\u00fcchner funnel or a Jena glass filter plate at a low temperature, washed thoroughly with ice water, pressed, and dried in a brown desiccator or in the absence of light (Note 4).\nThe filtrate and the washings contain in solution a small quantity of the product. This is recovered by distillation with steam. The acid distillate consists of snow-white crystals (if it is protected from light) and a solution of the compound. The solid is removed by filtration and washed. The filtrate is made neutral with sodium carbonate and extracted with ether. Upon drying and evaporating, the ethereal layer yields mononitrothiophene contaminated with dinitrothiophene (Note 5).\nThe total yield is 90\u2013110 g. (70\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 44\u201345\u00b0. If this material is steam-distilled and then repeatedly crystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 20\u201340\u00b0) it is obtained as colorless crystals melting at 45.5\u00b0 (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

            "(A) 2,6-Dibromo-4-aminophenol Chlorostannate.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 148.5 g. (0.5 mole) of 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol (p. 173) with 300 cc. (3.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19), 300 cc. of water, and 185 g. (1.56 gram atoms) of mossy tin. Three cubic centimeters of capryl alcohol is added to control the foaming, and the mixture is heated in the open flask with stirring on the steam bath until the reaction starts. The reaction may proceed vigorously at the outset, and it is well to heat cautiously during the initial stages. Hydrochloric acid and water are added from time to time, and foaming can be controlled by the addition of a part of the water. A total of 520 cc. (6.4 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 900 cc. of water are added during the course of the reaction. When the first, vigorous reaction is over the mixture is heated strongly until all the dibromonitrophenol has dissolved, and the hot solution (at about 85\u00b0) is filtered through a layer of Norite on a hot B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate, which usually is colorless, is cooled to 0\u00b0 with stirring for two hours, or allowed to stand in a cool place overnight. The product, which separates in the form of colorless or slightly yellow needles, is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold dilute hydrochloric acid (one volume of concentrated acid to one volume of water). The material is usually colorless and may be used directly for the reaction which follows (Note 1). After drying in an oven at 50\u201360\u00b0, or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide, the tin salt weights 214\u2013220 g. The theoretical weight, based on the formula assumed above, is 217 g.\n(B) 2,6-Dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide.\u2014The chlorostannate is conveniently oxidized in two batches (Note 2). In a 3-l. flask is placed a solution of 115 g. (2.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 175 cc. of water, 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and 108 g. (1.52 moles) of chlorine gas is passed into the mixture. About 80 per cent of the ice is melted by the operation. In a 5-l. flask 110 g. (0.127 mole) of the tin salt of 2,6-dibromo-4-aminophenol is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water and 12 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Solution is effected by warming the mixture to 40\u201350\u00b0, after which it is cooled to 15\u201317\u00b0 and 600 g. of ice is added. The sodium hypochlorite solution is then added all at once with vigorous stirring (Hood). A yellow precipitate of 2,6-dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide separates immediately, and chlorine is evolved. As soon as the sodium hypochlorite solution has been stirred in, 120 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added in order to keep the tin salts in solution (Note 3). The fine, yellow precipitate is filtered under the hood on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 4) and washed with 1.5 l. of 5 per cent hydrochloric acid to remove tin salts and chlorine. The product is dried on a glass tray at 30\u201340\u00b0 (Note 5), or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide. From two such batches the yield of chloroimide melting at 80\u201382\u00b0 is 126\u2013130 g. (84\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the weight of 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol used in Part A)."

(1.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings and 500 cc. of absolute ether. A solution of 206 g. (1.5 moles) of n-butyl bromide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 28, 37) in 250 cc. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. The stirrer is started, and 10\u201315 cc. of the bromide solution is allowed to flow into the flask from the funnel; the reaction generally begins within a few minutes (Note 1). As soon as refluxing is vigorous, the flask is surrounded by ice and water and the rate of addition of the bromide is adjusted so that moderate refluxing occurs. After all the solution has been added (thirty to forty minutes), the cooling bath is removed. Stirring is continued for fifteen minutes longer, after which only a small residue of unreacted magnesium remains.\nThe flask is cooled in an ice bath and a solution of 55.5 g. (0.75 mole) of pure ethyl formate (Note 2) in 100 cc. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. The stirrer is started and the ethyl formate solution is added at such a rate that the ether refluxes gently. This addition requires about one-half hour. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring is continued for ten minutes.\nWith vigorous stirring (Note 3), 100 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel at such a rate that rapid refluxing occurs. Following this, a cold solution of 85 g. (46 cc., 0.85 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 400 cc. of water is added. After the addition of the acid, the two layers become practically clear. A large part of the ethereal layer is decanted into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the remainder, together with the aqueous layer, is transferred to a separatory funnel. The solid remaining in the flask is washed with two 25-cc. portions of ether, which are added to the material in the separatory funnel. The ethereal layer is separated and combined with the decanted portion. The flask is fitted with an efficient fractionating column, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath until the temperature of the vapor reaches about 50\u00b0. To the residual impure carbinol (Note 4) is added 75 cc. of 15 per cent aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is boiled vigorously under reflux for three hours, after which the purified carbinol is removed by steam distillation, the volume in the flask being kept at 250\u2013300 cc. The distillate is collected in a separatory funnel so that the lower aqueous layer can be drawn off periodically. The distillation is complete when about 1.5 l. of water has been collected.\nThe upper layer of di-n-butylcarbinol is separated and allowed to stand over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for one hour. The liquid is decanted into a 500-cc. Claisen flask, and the residual potassium carbonate is washed with three 10-cc. portions of dry ether, which are added to the material in the distilling flask. After removing a small fraction of low-boiling material, there is obtained 90\u201392 g. (83\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount) of pure di-n-butylcarbinol, b.p. 97\u201398\u00b0/ 20 mm.

Vol. I, 1941, 235) and 900 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The solution is cooled in an efficient freezing mixture to 5\u00b0, and a cold solution of 107 g. (1.47 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is added dropwise with vigorous stirring at such a rate that the temperature remains between 5\u00b0 and 7\u00b0. With efficient cooling about one-half hour is required to add the nitrite. The mixture is stirred for one-half hour longer and then allowed to stand for four hours, during which time it warms up to room temperature.\nThe separatory funnel is replaced by a wide-bore condenser, and the third neck of the flask is fitted with a stopper. The solution is stirred and portions of 196 g. (3 gram atoms) of zinc dust (Note 1) are added quickly through the third neck of the flask until the liquid boils and then frequently enough to keep it boiling (Note 2). After the addition has been completed, the mixture is heated by a burner and refluxed for one hour (Note 3) and (Note 4). While still hot the contents of the flask are decanted from the remaining zinc into a crock containing 10 l. of water which is being vigorously stirred. The zinc residue is washed with two 50-cc. portions of hot glacial acetic acid which are also decanted into the water. After standing overnight, the crude product is filtered by suction, washed on the filter with two 500-cc. portions of water, and dried in air to constant weight. The yield is 205\u2013230 g. (57\u201364 per cent of the theoretical amount) of material melting at 126\u2013130\u00b0. On recrystallizing a 50-g. portion from 100 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and washing twice with 20-cc. portions of cold alcohol, there is obtained 38.5 g. of pale yellow crystals melting at 136\u2013137\u00b0 (Note 5)."

(0.5 mole) of crude 2,4-dimethyl-3,5-dicarbethoxypyrrole (p. 202) and a pinch of sand are added, and the whole is mixed thoroughly by shaking. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 130\u00b0 for two to three hours with occasional shaking until the thick paste has become partially liquefied owing to the formation of dimethylpyrrole.\nThe flask is next fitted for distillation with superheated steam and with a separatory funnel for the introduction of water into the center of the flask. A 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a vertical condenser is used as a receiver (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 479). The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160\u00b0, and superheated steam at 220\u2013250\u00b0 is introduced. The temperature of the oil bath is then gradually raised to 200\u00b0. If foaming becomes too great, a few drops of water are added from the separatory funnel, care being taken that the water does not strike the hot glass walls (Note 1). Steam distillation is continued until no more dimethylpyrrole comes over. This takes from one to two hours, and the distillate amounts to 2.5\u20133 l. The distillate is extracted once with 200 cc. of ether and three times with 100-cc. portions, and the extract is dried for two hours over 20 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation from a 100-cc. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. fractionating side arm, the solution being added gradually through a separatory funnel. After the ether is removed the residue is distilled and the fraction boiling at 160\u2013165\u00b0 is collected. The yield is 27 to 30 g.

The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and an inlet tube, the lower end of which is at least 2 cm. wide (to prevent clogging) and which nearly touches the surface of the reaction mixture.

After the mixture has cooled, the solid is broken up by means of a glass rod and mixed with 100 cc. of water; the mixture is then heated to boiling and filtered while hot. The residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling alcohol, and water is added (about 150 cc.) until the solution becomes turbid. Heat is applied until the turbidity disappears and then the solution is allowed to cool. After standing overnight, the crystals are filtered and dried. The yield is 31\u201335 g.

            "(A) Methyl Homoveratrate.\u2014In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1 l. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 200 g. (0.65 mole) of the azlactone of \u03b1-benzoylamino-\u03b2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acrylic acid (m.p. 149\u2013150\u00b0) (p. 55). The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and immersed in an oil bath so that the inner level is lower than the oil level of the bath (Note 1). The mixture is refluxed gently for six to seven hours, until the evolution of ammonia is complete. The resulting solution contains the sodium salts of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylpyruvic acid (Note 2) and benzoic acid.\nTo the above aqueous solution, contained in a 2-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, is added 85 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and is cooled in an ice-salt mixture. With stirring, 75 cc. of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (Merck's \"Superoxol\") diluted with 75 cc. of water is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 15\u00b0. After standing for about ten hours at room temperature (preferably overnight) the solution is acidified by the cautious addition (Note 3) of 450 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The warm acid solution is extracted with one 400-cc. portion and two 200-cc. portions of warm benzene. The combined benzene extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered through a cotton plug into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask.\nThe benzene is removed by distillation, 1 l. of methyl alcohol (Note 4) containing 15 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added, and the flask is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser provided with a drying tube. After refluxing gently for five hours the condenser is set downward for distillation and the methyl alcohol is distilled from a steam bath. The residual liquid is cooled and shaken with 500 cc. of cold water. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with one 400-cc. portion and two 200-cc. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are washed twice with 100-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution and finally with two 100-cc. portions of water. After the benzene solution has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, it is transferred to a 2-l. flask and the benzene is distilled, using a steam bath. The residual mixture of methyl benzoate and methyl homoveratrate is transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The first fraction, collected up to 100\u00b0 at 16 mm., is methyl benzoate (b.p. 87\u00b0/16 mm.) and weighs about 75 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount). After a small intermediate fraction of 2\u20133 g., pure methyl homoveratrate is collected at 176\u2013178\u00b0/16 mm. or 129\u2013131\u00b0/1 mm. The yield is 76\u201382 g. (56\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the azlactone).\n(B) Homoveratric Acid.\u2014In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask are placed 250 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 76 g. (0.36 mole) of methyl homoveratrate. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the mixture is boiled gently. The saponification proceeds rapidly, and the ester layer disappears after about ten minutes. The mixture is refluxed gently for twenty minutes longer, after which the solution is cooled in an ice bath and then poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 350 g. of ice. Crystals of the hydrate of homoveratric acid separate at once. After standing for about thirty minutes the crystalline product is filtered with suction and washed on the filter with two 25-cc. portions of ice water. The crystals are pressed thoroughly on the filter, pulverized, and allowed to stand overnight in a vacuum desiccator containing soda lime (to remove residual hydrochloric acid) and calcium chloride. The yield in the saponification is almost quantitative and amounts to 70 g. (55 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone). This product melts at 96\u201397\u00b0 and contains traces of sodium chloride. For purification it is dissolved in 350 cc. of hot benzene and the solution is filtered. To the hot filtrate is added 150 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 70\u201380\u00b0), and the solution is covered with a watch glass and allowed to cool slowly. After standing for several hours (preferably overnight) in a cool place, the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with a cold solution of 35 cc. of benzene and 15 cc. of ligroin, followed by 50 cc. of cold petroleum ether. The solvent is removed as completely as possible by pressing on the filter and finally by allowing the product to stand in a vacuum desiccator (Note 5). The purified homoveratric acid weighs 65 g. (51 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone) and melts sharply at 98\u00b0."

The flask is supported in an 800-cc. beaker which serves as a water bath. The side arm of the flask is connected by means of a short piece of rubber tubing to the narrow end (Note 3) of the combustion tube C which is made of Pyrex glass and is 20 mm. in diameter (inside) and 30 cm. in length. It is packed with pieces of porous plate held in place by constrictions as shown in the figure, and it is supported at each end by a small clamp at a sufficient height to give a clearance of 3\u20134 cm. above a Bunsen burner. The open end of the tube is connected by means of stoppers and a three-way stopcock (Note 4) to the vertical tube D, of the same diameter as C and 60 cm. long. This tube is packed with copper turnings to remove any uncombined bromine which may escape from the combustion tube. A safety bottle A containing water or some other suitable liquid and having a tube leading to the vent of the hood is placed in the train to provide an outlet for the hydrogen in case an obstruction is formed in the apparatus. It also provides a convenient method for determining the hydrogen pressure (Note 5). Hydrogen is obtained from a cylinder fitted with a reducing valve.\nFig. 9\n(B) Operation.\u2014The tube D is disconnected from the combustion tube by turning the stopcock so that the gases pass directly to the hood. Bromine is placed in flask B; the water bath is heated to 38\u00b0 and maintained at this temperature (Note 6). A slow stream of hydrogen is started through the apparatus, and, when the combustion tube is completely filled with bromine vapors, a low flame is placed under the empty section of the combustion tube. Soon a small yellow flame appears inside the heated portion of the tube, and, when all bromine vapor has been swept from the combustion tube, the latter is connected to the tube D (Note 7). The flame is adjusted to keep the lower part of the tube at a dull red heat; it may be necessary to raise or lower it, according to the rate of operation. The flow of hydrogen is regulated to give the desired output. The apparatus will conveniently produce 300 g. of hydrogen bromide per hour (Note 8)."

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a separatory funnel and a reflux condenser, is placed 145 g. (1.83 moles) of dry pyridine (Note 1); 231 g. (1.83 moles) of methyl sulfate is added dropwise through the separatory funnel. After the addition of the methyl sulfate the flask is heated in a boiling water bath for two hours to complete the reaction.\nThe flask containing the crude pyridinium salt is removed from the condenser, and the salt is dissolved by adding 400 cc. of water. The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer which will stir efficiently any volume of liquid which may be in the flask, and the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath. Separate solutions of 1.2 kg. (3.65 moles) of potassium ferricyanide in 2.4 l. of water and of 300 g. (7.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water are prepared and added dropwise from two separatory funnels to the well-stirred solution of the pyridinium salt at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 10\u00b0. The rate of addition of these two solutions is regulated so that all the sodium hydroxide solution has been introduced into the reaction mixture when one-half of the potassium ferricyanide solution has been added. This usually requires about one hour. The remaining half of the potassium ferricyanide is then added during another hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand five hours, during which time it comes to room temperature.\nThe 1-methyl-2-pyridone is salted out of the reaction mixture by the addition of 400\u2013500 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate to the well-stirred solution. When no more sodium carbonate dissolves, stirring is discontinued and the yellow or brown oily layer containing most of the desired pyridone, together with some of the unreacted pyridinium salt, water, and inorganic salts, is separated from the aqueous mixture. The aqueous mixture is filtered (Note 2) to remove the excess sodium carbonate and the precipitated potassium or sodium ferrocyanide. The filtrate is divided into three portions, each of which is extracted twice with 200-cc. portions of technical isoamyl alcohol (Note 3). The alcohol used for the second extraction of the first aqueous portion is satisfactory for the first extraction of a second aqueous portion, et cetera, so that a total volume of 800 cc. is used. The isoamyl alcohol extracts are combined and added to the oily layer which was first separated from the reaction mixture. An aqueous layer usually appears and is separated and extracted with another 100-cc. portion of amyl alcohol.\nThe combined alcohol extract is distilled under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask by heating on a water bath. All the solvent is thus recovered for use in a subsequent preparation.\nThe residue is transferred to a 250-cc. modified Claisen flask and distilled under diminished pressure from an oil bath. There is almost no low-boiling fraction if the alcohol has been carefully removed. The yield of product boiling at 122\u2013124\u00b0/11 mm. is 130\u2013140 g. (65\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4) and (Note 5). A small amount of black solid remains in the distillation flask after the pyridone has distilled."

To the upper end of the condenser is attached a glass tube which dips below the surface of a little carbon tetrachloride contained in a test tube. A current of chlorine, dried with sulfuric acid, is passed into the reaction mixture, the temperature of which is maintained at 50\u201360\u00b0. The rate of flow of the chlorine (about 16\u201317 g. per hour) is regulated so that little or no gas escapes through the carbon tetrachloride trap. The yellow di-o-nitrophenyl disulfide gradually disappears, and after two to two and one-half hours a homogeneous, dark yellow solution is obtained (Note 1). The warm solution is filtered from a small amount of dark residue through a warm B\u00fcchner funnel, the flask and filter being rinsed with 30 cc. of warm carbon tetrachloride.

(7.8 gram atoms) of clean sodium, cut in approximately 2.5-cm. cubes, is added in one lot and the flask connected to the condensers. The reaction is rather sluggish at first, requiring about one-half hour to reach the boiling point of the butyl alcohol (Note 3), but then becomes quite vigorous. With two condensers no difficulty is encountered in taking care of the reflux, but, if the reaction becomes too vigorous or excessive foaming occurs, wet towels should be placed on the flask until the reaction is again under control (Note 4). Toward the end of the reaction the flask is placed on a heated sand bath and gentle refluxing maintained until all the sodium has reacted. The heating is stopped temporarily, 160 cc. of water is added gradually through the condenser, and the solution is again refluxed gently for one hour (Note 5).

A glass outlet tube leads from the reflux condenser to the hood. In the flask are placed 200 g. (0.65 mole) of di-o-nitrophenyl disulfide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 220), 1 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), and 200 cc. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42). A stream of chlorine is passed into the mixture at the rate of about two bubbles per second, and the solution is warmed on a steam bath to 70\u00b0. In about thirty minutes the disulfide melts and the solution becomes orange-red in color. After the disulfide has melted, the heating and addition of chlorine are continued for one hour. The sulfonyl chloride is separated immediately from the supernatant liquid by decantation, washed with two 300-cc. portions of warm water (70\u00b0), and allowed to solidify. The water is drained from the solid mass as completely as possible.\nThe washed chloride is dissolved in 140 cc. of glacial acetic acid at 50\u201360\u00b0, and the solution is quickly filtered by suction. The filtrate is chilled by immersing the flask in cold water and is vigorously stirred in order to cause the sulfonyl chloride to separate in fine crystals. The mixture is now triturated thoroughly with a liter of cold water which is then decanted into a large B\u00fcchner funnel. The process is repeated twice. Finally, a liter of cold water is added to the mixture, and then 10 cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added, with stirring. The crystals are collected at once on the filter, washed with 200 cc. of water, and allowed to dry in the air. The yield is 240 g. (84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a light yellow product, melting at 64\u201365\u00b0. This material may be used without further purification (and without being dried) for the preparation of orthanilic acid.\n(B) Orthanilic Acid.\u2014A 3-l. flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a liquid-sealed stirrer, is placed on a hot plate. In the flask is placed a mixture of 200 g. (0.90 mole) of o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 100 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 600 cc. of water. The mixture is heated to boiling and stirred in order to promote the hydrolysis, which is complete within forty-five minutes after the compound has melted. The orange-red solution is filtered, and the filtrate is made just acid to litmus by the addition of acetic acid, about 25 cc. being required. The solution is transferred to a 3-l. three-necked flask which is provided with a reflux condenser and an efficient liquid-sealed stirrer. The solution is heated to boiling on the hot plate, and iron filings (about 20-mesh) are added, with vigorous stirring, at the rate of about 25 g. every fifteen minutes. A total of 350 g. of iron is used. In a few minutes the mixture becomes very deep brown in color and has a tendency to foam. After stirring for four hours, a sample when filtered should yield an almost colorless filtrate; if the filtrate is red or orange, stirring and heating must be continued. When a light-colored filtrate is obtained, 2 g. of decolorizing carbon is added, the hot mixture is filtered by suction, and the residue is washed several times with small amounts of hot water which are added to the main solution. The filtrate is chilled to about 15\u00b0, and 95 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is slowly added. The orthanilic acid separates in fine colorless crystals which appear as hexagonal plates under the microscope (Note 1). When the temperature has again fallen to about 15\u00b0, the mass is filtered and the precipitate is washed with water and then with ethyl alcohol. If about 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate, an additional deposit of about 1 g. will be obtained after a few hours' standing. The yield is 89 g. (57 per cent of the theoretical amount). The compound is 97\u2013100 per cent pure and for many purposes will not require recrystallization. Material of analytical purity may be obtained by one recrystallization from hot water. The decomposition point is about 325\u00b0 (bloc Maquenne)."

            "In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer is placed 1 l. of water. The water is heated to boiling, and 500 g. (4.7 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added. As soon as the carbonate has dissolved, 250 g. (1.26 moles) of arsenious oxide and 11 g. of crystalline copper sulfate are added with stirring. When all the solids have dissolved the solution is cooled with stirring under a stream of tap water until the temperature falls to 15\u00b0.\nConcurrently with the preparation of the sodium arsenite solution, a solution of benzenediazonium chloride is prepared. To a well-stirred mixture of 186 g. (2 moles) of technical aniline, 400 cc. (4.8 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19), 1 l. of water, and enough crushed ice to make a volume of about 3 l., is added slowly a solution of 145 g. (2 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 500 cc. of water. This requires about thirty to forty minutes.\nThe benezenediazonium chloride solution is then added with stirring during a period of one hour to the suspension of sodium arsenite, cooled in an ice and salt bath to 0\u00b0. The temperature during the reaction is held below 5\u00b0 (Note 1). Frothing takes place owing to the escape of nitrogen, but this is easily controlled by the occasional addition of a small quantity of benzene. Stirring is continued for one hour after the addition of the diazonium chloride solution, and the mixture is filtered to remove the solid material which separates. This is washed with 500 cc. of cold water, and the combined liquors are concentrated over a free flame to a volume of about 1.5 l. (Note 2).\nTo the hot concentrated solution, which is deep brown in color, concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until no more tarry material separates (Note 3). The tar is filtered and more hydrochloric acid is added until, after filtering, a clear pale yellow solution results. It is important to remove all the tar at this time; otherwise, subsequent recrystallizations will not free the product from color. The phenylarsonic acid is then precipitated by the addition of 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) (Note 4). When the mixture has cooled (preferably by standing overnight) the phenylarsonic acid is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 200 cc. of cold water. The light yellow crystals are dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling water, 20 g. of Norite is added, the solution filtered hot, and the filtrate allowed to cool. After filtering and drying, the white crystals melt with decomposition at 154\u2013158\u00b0, passing into the anhydride, C6H5AsO2. The yield is 160\u2013182 g.

(0.675 mole) of finely powdered ammonium dichromate and 200 g. (2.6 moles) of ammonium thiocyanate is added in portions of 10\u201312 g. with constant stirring.

The flames are extinguished, and the remainder of the mixture is added at such a rate that the heat of reaction maintains the temperature at 160\u00b0 (Note 2). Stirring is continued while the mass cools, and any lumps of solid which form around the sides of the vessel are broken loose (Note 3).\nThe product, while still warm (Note 4), is finely powdered and stirred with 750 cc. of ice water in a large beaker. After fifteen minutes the insoluble portion is filtered by suction, freed as completely as possible from mother liquor without washing (Note 5), and stirred into 2.5 l. of water previously warmed to 65\u00b0.

The acid chloride thus obtained is a nearly colorless liquid and needs no further purification. The flask is cooled, 175 cc. of carbon disulfide is added, and the solution cooled in an ice bath. Thirty grams (0.23 mole) of aluminum chloride is added rapidly in one lot, and the flask is immediately connected to the reflux condenser.

(0.46 mole) of pure aluminum ethoxide (Note 2). An efficient fractionating column (Note 3) is attached to the flask through a cork in the central neck, and through one of the side necks is passed a tube leading to the bottom of the flask for the introduction of dry nitrogen (Note 4). The remaining neck is tightly stoppered. It is used to withdraw portions of liquid for testing.\nTo the outlet of the column is attached a U-tube and a Peligot tube each of about 100-cc. capacity. The U-tube is immersed in a freezing mixture, and the Peligot tube is filled with saturated sodium bisulfite solution. The oil bath is then heated to 135\u00b0 and a slow current of gas is admitted. The mixture boils vigorously, but the alcohol is returned by the refluxing device whereas the acetaldehyde formed by the reaction is allowed to pass through and is caught in the freezing mixture and the Peligot tube.\nThe end of the reaction is easily determined by removing a few drops of the reaction mixture and treating with water in a test tube. After the aluminum hydroxide settles, the clear liquid is decanted and a few drops of yellow ammonium sulfide are added to it. So long as chloral is present, even in traces, a dark brown coloration will be produced on heating to incipient boiling. If the liquid collecting in the U-tube is removed every few hours, the completion of the reaction will be readily noticed by the diminishing quantity of acetaldehyde coming over. After twenty-three or twenty-four hours of heating (over a period of two or three days) the reaction is complete. The temperature of the bath is then allowed to fall to 120\u00b0 and the alcohol is distilled through an ordinary condenser which replaces the fractionating column. When the residue of aluminum trichloroethoxide is nearly dry (Note 5), the flask is removed from the oil bath and the solid is treated with 250 cc. of 20 per cent sulfuric acid and stirred thoroughly to ensure complete decomposition.\nThe mixture is then subjected to steam distillation until no more trichloroethyl alcohol passes over. About 4 l. of distillate is obtained (Note 6). The oil is separated from the aqueous layer, which is saturated with sodium sulfate and extracted with three 200-cc. portions of ether. The ether solution is added to the main portion of the alcohol, and the whole is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.\nThe ether is removed by distillation and the product distilled under reduced pressure (Note 7). There is obtained 215 g. (84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of trichloroethyl alcohol boiling at 94\u201397\u00b0/125 mm. and melting at 16\u201317\u00b0 (Note 8). A purer compound can be obtained by refractionating under reduced pressure and pressing the crystals on a cooled porous plate. Pure trichloroethyl alcohol has a melting point of 19\u00b0 (Note 9)."

            "In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, 83 g. (0.5 mole) of veratraldehyde (p. 619) is dissolved in 200 cc. of warm 95 per cent alcohol, and a warm solution of 42 g. (0.6 mole) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 318) in 50 cc. of water is added. The two solutions are mixed thoroughly, and a solution of 30 g. (0.75 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 40 cc. of water is introduced. After the mixture has stood for two and one-half hours at room temperature, 250 g. of crushed ice is added and the solution is saturated with carbon dioxide. This causes the separation of the aldoxime as an oil which solidifies on standing overnight in an ice chest (Note 1). The crystalline oxime is filtered with suction, washed thoroughly with water, and allowed to dry in the air. The yield of oxime is 88\u201389 g. (97\u201398 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe veratraldoxime is placed with 100 g. of acetic anhydride (94\u201396 per cent) in a 300-cc. round-bottomed flask provided with a ground-glass air condenser (Note 2), and heated cautiously. A vigorous reaction takes place, and when this occurs the flame is removed. After the reaction has subsided the solution is boiled gently for twenty minutes and then poured carefully, with stirring, into 300 cc. of cold water. The stirring is continued, and on cooling the nitrile separates in small, almost colorless crystals, which are filtered and dried in the air. The veratronitrile thus obtained is quite pure; it weighs 57\u201362 g. (70\u201376 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the veratraldehyde), and melts at 66\u201367\u00b0."
