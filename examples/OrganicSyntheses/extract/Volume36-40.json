            "In a 1-l. three-necked flask immersed in an ice bath and provided with a stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel are placed 168 ml. (200 g.) of concentrated (37\u201338%) hydrochloric acid (2 moles) and 240 g. of paraformaldehyde (effectively 8 moles of formaldehyde). While the temperature is maintained below 10\u00b0, 452 ml. (6.9 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid is added dropwise at such a rate that gaseous hydrogen chloride is not lost from the mixture. This requires about 5.5 hours. The mixture is stirred for 4 hours in the melting ice bath and comes to room temperature. It may be allowed to stand overnight. The layers are separated, and the product (upper layer) is washed twice with ice water. Ice is added to the product, and 250 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide is then added to the mixture slowly with vigorous agitation until the aqueous phase is strongly alkaline (Note 1). The product is separated and dried rapidly over potassium carbonate and then over potassium hydroxide, keeping the product cold during drying (Note 2). After separation of the drying agent by filtration, 350\u2013370 g. (76\u201381%) of product sufficiently pure for many purposes is obtained. On distillation there is obtained 330\u2013350 g.

The apparatus is allowed to stand in a hood overnight (about 16 hours), at the end of which time the solution is heated under reflux for 30 minutes on a steam bath. The solution is then poured into 750 ml. of ice water contained in a 2-l. separatory funnel (Note 5), and the mixture is extracted with two 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with two 250-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and one 250-ml. portion of water. The washed extracts are dried over 45 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated by distillation. The residue is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask at reduced pressure.

At the end of the heating period the solution is concentrated by heating in an oil bath at 100\u00b0 at reduced pressure (15\u201320 mm.) until no further material is distilled (Note 7). The residue is allowed to cool to room temperature and poured slowly, with stirring, into 1-l. of ice-cold saturated sodium bicarbonate solution contained in a 2-l. beaker. Solid sodium bicarbonate is added in small portions until the solution becomes neutral to universal indicator paper (Note 8). The solution is then extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether in a 2-l. separatory funnel (Note 9), (Note 10). The aqueous phase is placed in a 3-l. beaker and acidified cautiously with ice-cold 12N sulfuric acid until the mixture is acid to Congo red paper (Note 11). The oily suspension is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether in a 2-l. separatory funnel. The ether extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over 45 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried ether extract is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and concentrated on a steam bath until ether is no longer distilled. To the residue there is added 500 ml. of warm (50\u201360\u00b0) concentrated hydrochloric acid (in a hood), and the suspension is allowed to cool with occasional swirling (Note 12). Crystallization is completed by chilling in ice, and the product is collected on a sintered-glass funnel. After the product has been dried as much as possible on the funnel it is dried to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator over solid potassium hydroxide. The yield of dry acid is 82\u201384 g. (80\u201382%), m.p. 77.5\u201379.5\u00b0. It is satisfactory for most purposes.

            "To a solution of 16.8 g. (0.40 mole) of cyanamide in 50 ml. of water (Note 1) contained in a 400-ml. flask or beaker is added 50 ml. of aqueous 3N sodium hydroxide (0.15 mole). To the resulting solution, cooled to 15\u201318\u00b0, is added, in 2-ml. portions with shaking over a 15\u201318 minute period, 23.8 g. (22.0 ml., 0.2 mole) of phenyl isocyanate. The isocyanate dissolves rapidly, while the temperature rises slightly. The mixture is maintained at 20\u201325\u00b0 by occasional external cooling in ice water. When half the phenyl isocyanate has been introduced, a second portion of 50 ml. (0.15 mole) of 3N sodium hydroxide is added to keep the reaction mixture strongly alkaline throughout the experiment. When addition is complete (Note 2), the slightly turbid liquid is diluted with 40 ml. of water and is filtered immediately under reduced pressure (Note 3) to remove undissolved impurities and traces of separated diphenylurea (Note 4). The cyanourea is precipitated from the clear colorless filtrate by the slow addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid with stirring until a permanent turbidity just appears (Note 3). Cracked ice (30\u201340 g.) is added to lower the temperature to 18\u201320\u00b0. Precipitation is then completed in this temperature range by the alternate addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (total volume required, approximately 30 ml.) and cracked ice until the suspension is acid to Congo red. The crude cyanourea forms a microcrystalline, white precipitate, which, after storage at 0\u00b0 for 3 hours, is collected by filtration under reduced pressure (Note 5) and is washed with two portions of cold water (20\u201325 ml.) (Note 6). The crude product is drained thoroughly, air-dried at room temperature, and finally dried to constant weight in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield of crude 1-cyano-3-phenylurea (Note 7), m.p. 122\u2013126\u00b0 with decomposition (Note 8), varies between 29 and 30.5 g. (90\u201395%). The dried material is purified as follows. A solution of the crude product in 100 ml. of boiling acetone is diluted slowly with gentle swirling with 30\u201340 ml. of petroleum ether (boiling range 40\u201360\u00b0). As crystallization proceeds, an additional 20\u201330 ml. of petroleum ether is added carefully at such a rate that the supernatant liquid does not become turbid. After 15 minutes at room temperature, the mixture is set aside at 0\u00b0. The product is collected by filtration under reduced pressure and washed successively with 50 ml. of an acetone-petroleum ether mixture (1:3) and 50 ml. of petroleum ether. 1-Cyano-3-phenylurea thus obtained forms colorless lustrous needles, m.p. 127\u2013128\u00b0 with decomposition (Note 8), yield 20\u201321.5 g. (62\u201367%). Slow dilution of the filtrates with petroleum ether to a total volume of 350\u2013400 ml. and storage at 0\u00b0 affords a second crop, m.p. 123\u2013126\u00b0 (dec.), of satisfactory purity; yield 4\u20135 g.

Acetone cooled in a Dry Ice-acetone bath is circulated through the condenser, and the distillation receiver is immersed in ice water (Note 2). The mixture in the flask is heated to 60\u201363\u00b0, and a 10\u201315-ml. portion of a solution consisting of 122.4 g. (0.6 mole) of 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane (Note 3) in 50 ml. of methanol is added dropwise over a period of a few minutes. The reaction generally becomes moderately vigorous at this point, and refluxing of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene part-way up the column is observed. The heating bath is removed at this time. Addition of the ethane derivative is continued at such a rate that the temperature of the refluxing liquid at the head of the column is maintained at 18\u201322\u00b0. The flask may require occasional shaking to prevent the zinc dust from agglomerating. The take-off rate of the ethylene derivative is adjusted to about one-half the rate of input of the ethane derivative. During this addition, the temperature in the distillation flask drops to 45\u201350\u00b0. The addition of the ethane derivative requires 45 minutes to 1 hour. The heating bath is replaced, and another hour is required to complete the dehalogenation and to distil the last of the product. The temperature in the distillation flask during this period gradually rises to 69\u201370\u00b0. There is collected in the receiver 71\u201376 g.

In the two dropping funnels are placed, respectively, 96 g. (1.0 mole) of furfural (Note 3) and a solution of 40 g. (1.0 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water. The contents of the flask are heated to about 55\u00b0, vigorous stirring is started, and a rapid stream of oxygen is bubbled through as the contents of the two funnels are added simultaneously (Note 4) to the reaction mixture at such a rate (20\u201325 min.) as to maintain the temperature at 50\u201355\u00b0 (Note 5) without external heating. After the additions have been completed, vigorous stirring and passage of oxygen are continued until the temperature drops below 40\u00b0 (15\u201330 min., depending on the rate of oxygen flow).\nThe catalyst is separated by filtration, and the aqueous solution is extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether (Note 6), acidified with 30% sulfuric acid, boiled for 45 min. (Note 7) with 6\u20137 g. of carbon, then filtered hot. The filtrate is cooled to 0\u00b0 and allowed to stand at this temperature for 1 hour or longer. The 2-furoic acid, which separates as pale pink needles, m.p. 130\u2013132\u00b0, is collected by suction filtration and washed with small portions of ice water (Note 8). The yield is 96\u2013101 g.

            "In a thoroughly dry 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a 100-ml. dropping funnel and a short fractionating column (Note 2), is placed a mixture of 116 g. (2.0 moles) of anhydrous finely powdered potassium fluoride (Note 3) and 200 g. of dry ethylene glycol (Note 4). The fractionating column carries a thermometer and is connected to a downward double-surface condenser with a filter flask as receiver. The round flask is heated at a bath temperature of 160\u2013170\u00b0, and 165 g. (1.0 mole) of n-hexyl bromide, b.p. 154\u2013156\u00b0 (Note 5), is added dropwise during 5 hours; liquid passes over intermittently at 60\u201390\u00b0 (temperature at the top of the fractionating column). The bath temperature is allowed to fall to 110\u2013120\u00b0, and a slow stream of air is drawn through the apparatus by attaching the side arm of the filter flask to a water pump and replacing the dropping funnel by a narrow-bore tube dipping just below the surface of the liquid; stirring is maintained during this operation. It is advisable to interpose a U-tube cooled in ice between the water pump and the receiver in order to recover any uncondensed liquid. The combined distillates are then distilled at atmospheric pressure through an efficient fractionating column; after a small fore-run (up to 10 g.) of 1-hexene, the crude n-hexyl fluoride is collected at 89\u201392\u00b0 (46\u201348 g.). The crude product is purified by cooling in ice and adding 1-ml. portions of a solution containing 9.0 g. of bromine and 6.0 g. of potassium bromide in 50 ml. of water until the organic layer acquires an orange color; after each addition the mixture is shaken vigorously for a minute or so. The volume of bromine-potassium bromide solution required is usually less than 5 ml. The aqueous layer is separated, the organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous potassium bromide solution until color-less and finally with water. The liquid is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilled through an efficient fractionating column; the n-hexyl flouride is collected at 91\u201392\u00b0. This procedure yields 42\u201347 g. (40\u201345% over-all yield based on the bromide employed) of a water-white product, nD20 1.375, nD25 1.372\u20131.373, d420 0.8011.

The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, filtered with suction, and the solid is washed with several 100-ml. portions of ether. After the ether is removed from the filtrates, the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of laurylmethylamine, a colorless liquid boiling at 110\u2013115\u00b0/1.2\u20131.5 mm., is 121\u2013142 g. (81\u201395%) (Note 6)."

            "One hundred and eighty grams (1.65 moles) of liquefied 3-methylpyridine-1-oxide (Note 1) is added to 630 ml. of cold (0\u20135\u00b0) sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) contained in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask immersed in an ice-salt bath. The resulting mixture is cooled to about 10\u00b0, and 495 ml. of fuming yellow nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50) is added in 50-ml. portions with shaking. An efficient spiral condenser (52 \u00d7 4 cm.) is attached to the flask, and the latter is placed in an oil bath. The temperature is slowly raised to 95\u2013100\u00b0 during 25\u201330 minutes, at which time gas evolution begins. After about 5 minutes the rate of gas evolution increases, and the oil bath is removed. A spontaneous and vigorous reaction commences which must be controlled by the application of an ice-water bath (Note 2). After the vigorous reaction has subsided to a moderate rate (about 5 minutes) the ice-water bath is removed, and the reaction is allowed to proceed for an additional 5\u201310 minutes. The oil bath is then replaced, and heating is continued at 100\u2013105\u00b0 for 2 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0 and poured onto 2 kg. of crushed ice carbonate in a 4-l. beaker. Addition of 1.36 kg. of sodium carbonate monohydrate (Hood!) (Note 3) in small portions with stirring causes the separation of the yellow crystalline product along with sodium sulfate. The mixture is then allowed to stand for 3 hours to expel nitrogen oxides. The yellow solid is collected by suction filtration, thoroughly washed with water, and rendered as dry as possible on the filter. The filtrates (about 4 l.) are transferred to a separatory funnel.\nThe collected solid is extracted twice with 400\u2013500 ml. portions of boiling chloroform, the combined extracts are used to extract the aqueous filtrates contained in the separatory funnel, and the extraction is repeated with several fresh 500-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are then given preliminary drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue is transferred to a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 1.5 l. of boiling acetone. The acetone solution is concentrated on a steam bath to 800\u2013900 ml. (crystallization begins when the volume is about 1 l.) and then cooled at 5\u00b0 for 6\u20138 hours. The product is filtered by suction, the filtrates are removed and saved, and the collected solid is washed with ether and dried. The yield is 162\u2013173 g. (64\u201368%), m.p. 137\u2013138\u00b0. The acetone filtrates mentioned above are boiled down to 150 ml. and chilled in an ice bath, and the crude product so obtained (m.p. 131\u2013135\u00b0) is recrystallized from acetone to give an additional 13.5\u201316.5 g., m.p. 136\u2013138\u00b0.

One hundred and one grams (0.5 mole) of diethyl adipate2 is added dropwise to the boiling stirred solution at such a rate that a separate liquid phase does not accumulate in the reaction mixture (Note 3). This operation requires 1\u20132 hours, at the end of which time the contents of the flask will have largely crystallized. The boiling is continued for 5 minutes after the completion of the addition, and the contents of the flask are then cooled to room temperature with running water.

The stirring is started, and 80 g. (0.46 mole) of adipyl hydrazide is added all at once, followed by 500 ml. of ether (Note 5). While the temperature is maintained below 10\u00b0 (Note 6), a solution of 80 g.

The operations in the next paragraph should be conducted without delay after the completion of the addition of the nitrite.\nThe cold reaction mixture, which may be freed from suspended solid by rapid filtration through a cotton plug, is transferred to a 2-l. or 3-l. separatory funnel, and the aqueous layer is drawn off into the original reaction flask. The ether layer is poured into a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask containing about 50 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, and this flask is placed in the ice bath in which the diazotization was run. The cold aqueous layer is then extracted with two 100-ml. portions of chilled ether, which are combined with the first ether extract. After 5 minutes with occasional swirling, the ether solution of adipyl azide (Note 7) is sufficiently dry, and it is poured into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask containing 350\u2013400 ml. of benzene (Note 8). The calcium chloride is rinsed with a 50-ml. portion of ether, which is added to the same flask.\nThe ether is distilled gently from a steam bath, preferably through a short fractionating column; nitrogen will be evolved at the same time. When the volume of the contents of the flask has reached about 400 ml., the flask is heated strongly on the steam bath for about 15 minutes to complete the decomposition of the azide (Note 9). The flask is removed from the steam bath, and 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added cautiously to the hot solution (Note 10). The flask is allowed to stand with occasional swirling until the carbon dioxide evolution has ceased (about 15 minutes). The mixture is heated strongly on a steam bath for about 15 minutes more, and the solvents are then distilled from a steam bath under aspirator vacuum (Note 11). When the contents of the flask have become a crystalline paste, the vacuum is temporarily disconnected, and the inner walls of the flask are washed down with about 50 ml. of ethanol.

The last portions of ethanol are used as wash liquid for the crystals. The crystals are finally pressed dry and washed with 25 ml. of ether. The air-dried product weighs 53\u201355 g. (72\u201374%) and melts above 275\u00b0. Analysis for chlorine indicates that the salt is anhydrous. Concentration of the filtrate to a volume of about 25 ml. yields an additional 1\u20132 g.; total yield 73\u201377%. The entire synthesis may be completed in one day."

            "In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser, is placed 80 g. (1.1 moles) of dimethylformamide (Note 1). The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and the internal temperature is maintained at 10\u201320\u00b0, while 169 g. (1.1 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride is added through the dropping funnel over a period of 15 minutes. An exothermic reaction occurs with the formation of the phosphorus oxychloride-dimethylformamide complex. The ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes (Note 2).\nThe ice bath is replaced, and 250 ml. of ethylene dichloride is added to the mixture. When the internal temperature has been lowered to 5\u00b0, a solution of 67 g. (1.0 mole) of freshly distilled pyrrole in 250 ml. of ethylene dichloride is added through a clean dropping funnel to the stirred, cooled mixture over a period of 1 hour. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is replaced with a heating mantle, and the mixture is stirred at the reflux temperature for 15 minutes, during which time there is copious evolution of hydrogen chloride.\nThe mixture is then cooled to 25\u201330\u00b0, and to it is added through the dropping funnel a solution of 750 g. (5.5 moles) of sodium acetate trihydrate (Note 3) in about 1 l. of water, cautiously at first, then as rapidly as possible. The reaction mixture is again refluxed for 15 minutes, vigorous stirring being maintained all the while (Note 4).\nThe cooled mixture is transferred to a 3-l. separatory funnel, and the ethylene dichloride layer is removed. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with a total of about 500 ml. of ether. The ether and ethylene chloride solutions are combined and washed with three 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution, which is added cautiously at first to avoid too rapid evolution of carbon dioxide. The non-aqueous solution is then dried over anhydrous sodium carbonate, the solvents are distilled, and the remaining liquid is transferred to a Claisen flask and distilled from an oil bath under reduced pressure (Note 5). The aldehyde boils at 78\u00b0 at 2 mm.; there is very little fore-run and very little residue. The yield of crude 2-pyrrolealdehyde is 85\u201390 g. (89\u201395%), as an almost water-white liquid which soon crystallizes. A sample dried on a clay plate melts at 35\u201340\u00b0. The crude product is purified by dissolving in boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 40\u201360\u00b0), in the ratio of 1 g. of crude 2-pyrrolealdehyde to 25 ml. of solvent, and cooling the solution slowly to room temperature, followed by refrigeration for a few hours. The pure aldehyde is obtained from the crude in approximately 85% recovery. The over-all yield from pyrrole is 78\u201379% of pure 2-pyrrolealdehyde, m.p. 44\u201345\u00b0."

            "The apparatus2 consists of a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed creased flask, with standard ball joints and an indented cone-shaped bottom (Note 1), which is heated by means of an electric mantle and is equipped with a high-speed stirrer of stainless steel driven by a 10,000 r.p.m. motor (Note 2). One side neck is fitted with a bulb-type air-cooled condenser (Note 3), on top of which fits a 1-l. pressure-equalizing Hershberg dropping funnel (Note 4). The top of the dropping funnel is connected in turn to a U-tube containing a 1-cm. head of mercury. The entire apparatus is securely fastened to a sturdy support.\nIn the flask is placed 900 ml. of xylene (Note 5), and a slow stream of purified nitrogen (Note 6) is passed through the system from which the dropping funnel has been temporarily removed. The stirrer is run at slow speed, and the solvent is brought to a gentle reflux. The air stream cooling the condenser is shut off, the mercury valve is disconnected from the condenser, and a few milliliters of solvent is allowed to distil out the top of the condenser (Note 7). The dropping funnel (Note 8), containing a solution of 115 g. (0.50 mole) of dimethyl sebacate (Note 9) and 500 ml. of xylene (Note 5) is then inserted between the top of the condenser and the mercury valve. The air to the condenser is then turned on, and the electric mantle is turned off. The solvent is allowed to cool below its boiling point, and the stirrer is gradually brought to a stop. Throughout these operations the nitrogen flow is adjusted to keep air out of the system. Through a side neck is then added 50.6 g. (2.20 g. atoms) of crust-free sodium metal cut into lumps of convenient size. The side neck is closed, and the stirrer and the heater are turned on. The sodium is dispersed by stirring at about 6000\u20138000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes, and, with continued heating and stirring at a rate somewhat slower (to give suitable mixing), the dropwise addition of the ester solution is begun at such a rate as to be complete in about 24 hours (Note 10) and (Note 11).\nHeating and stirring are continued for 1 hour after the addition is completed. The stirrer is then slowed, heating is stopped, the heater is removed, and the reaction flask is allowed to cool for about 15 minutes (Note 12). The reaction flask is then cooled in a water bath, and is finally thoroughly cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 140 ml. of glacial acetic acid in an equal volume of xylene is then added dropwise during about 30 minutes with continued cooling and stirring (Note 13). After addition of 450 ml. of water, stirring is stopped, the nitrogen is turned off, and the flask is disconnected from the apparatus. The two-phase mixture is filtered through a large B\u00fcchner funnel with suction to remove a small amount of gum, and the filtrate is then poured into a 3-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is drawn off, extracted with 100 ml. of xylene, and is discarded. The xylene phases are washed in series with 100 ml. of water, and are combined and dried with 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution is filtered into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, and the bulk of the xylene is distilled with the aid of an aspirator (Note 14) and (Note 15). The residue is transferred to a smaller flask and is distilled through a 2-ft. Vigreux column, the fraction boiling at 134\u2013138\u00b0/14 mm. or 124\u2013128\u00b0/9 mm. being collected as a yellowish liquid weighing 57\u201363 g. (67\u201374%). This material solidifies on standing and is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 16) and (Note 18). For further purification it may be crystallized from 150 ml. of pentane by cooling to \u221210\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath for several hours. The mixture is filtered, and the crystals are washed with 50 ml. of pentane which has been cooled to \u221280\u00b0. The pure product thus obtained is a white granular crystalline solid, m.p. 38\u201339\u00b0, weighing 53\u201356 g. (63\u201366%) (Note 17) and (Note 18)."

The dropping funnel, which should have a close-fitting stopcock well lubricated with heavy silicone grease, is placed so as to discharge sulfur trioxide well above the surface of the reaction mixture. Palmitic acid (200 g., 0.78 mole) (Note 1) and 600 ml. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 2) are added to the flask. Solution of the palmitic acid is endothermic and causes the temperature of the mixture to fall 5 to 10\u00b0 below room temperature (Note 3). Stabilized liquid sulfur trioxide, 53 ml. (100 g., 1.25 moles) (Note 4), is added dropwise from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture. Solution of palmitic acid becomes complete, the solution darkens, and the temperature rises to 45\u00b0 as the sulfur trioxide is added over a 30-minute period. The reaction mixture is finally heated for 1 hour at 50\u201365\u00b0 with continued stirring and is then chilled in an ice bath before the accessories are removed from the flask. The necks are closed with glass stoppers, and the reaction mixture is refrigerated at about \u221215\u00b0 overnight (Note 5).\nCrystallized solids are filtered by suction (Note 6), washed with cold carbon tetrachloride, and dried at room temperature in a vacuum desiccator to constant weight (1 to 2 days). The crude dark product weighs 197\u2013223 g. (75\u201385%), and is usually satisfactory for the preparation of derivatives such as salts (Note 7) and esters.2 One crystallization from acetone (7 ml./g.) at \u221220\u00b0 yields a light gray solid, with neutralization equivalent within 1\u20132% of the theoretical value of 168, in a yield of 178\u2013197 g. (68\u201375%). Two or three additional crystallizations (leaving a yield of only 25\u201330%) are required to give an almost colorless crystalline solid, m.p. 90\u201391\u00b0 (Note 8). Once crystallized material is moderately stable to storage in a container protected from moisture, but slow darkening occurs, especially in presence of sunlight."

The flask is suspended in a steam cone, which can also be used as a cooling bath. In the flask is placed 50 g. (2.05 g. atoms) of fine magnesium turnings (Note 3). In the dropping funnel is first introduced 5 ml. of a solution of 250 g. (175 ml., 2.3 moles) of ethyl bromide in 500 ml. of absolute ether. Three drops of bromine is mixed with the 5 ml., and the mixture is added to the magnesium. The Grignard reaction which starts at once (Note 4) is maintained by gradually adding the remainder of the ethyl bromide-ether solution. When the spontaneous reaction subsides, the mixture is heated gently under reflux with stirring for 30 minutes.\nThe flask is then cooled in ice, and in the course of about 20 minutes 83 g. of tin tetrachloride (37 ml., 0.32 mole) is added with vigorous stirring (Note 5). The mixture is heated at the reflux temperature for 1 hour, after which the condenser is set for distillation. During 1.5 hours the ether is removed by distillation while the flask is heated by an ample supply of steam (Note 6) and (Note 7).\nThe flask is again cooled in ice, the collected ether is returned to the reaction mixture, and the latter is decomposed by slowly adding first 85 ml. of ice water, then 400 ml. of ice-cold 10% hydrochloric acid. After stirring for some minutes, the contents of the flask are transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the ether layer is filtered through a folded filter and dried with calcium chloride (Note 8).\nThe ether is removed by distillation, and the crude tetraethyltin is distilled under water-pump vacuum, using a water bath for heating.

The flask is heated until the dimethylformamide is almost refluxing. Then, with stirring, 280 ml. (318 g., 2.5 moles) of 1,4-dichlorobutane and a solution of 359 g. (2.75 moles) of 60% sodium sulfide (Note 2) in 1 l. of hot water are added simultaneously from the dropping funnels at such a rate that the mixture refluxes without application of heat (Note 3). After the addition is complete (about 1.5 hours), the mixture is heated at reflux with stirring for an additional 2 hours. The condenser is arranged for distillation, and 600 ml. of distillate is collected (Note 4). The distillate is made alkaline by adding 20 g. of sodium hydroxide, and sodium chloride is added to the saturation point. The aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the crude tetrahydrothiophene layer is dried over solid potassium hydroxide. Distillation through a 30-cm.

            "A mixture of 213 g. (1.5 moles) of phosphorus pentoxide and 14 g. of kieselguhr (Note 1) is prepared by shaking in a dry, stoppered 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. About one-half of the mixture is then added to a mixture of 7 g. of asbestos (Note 1) and 190 g. (1.0 mole) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Note 2) in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask with one standard-taper neck protected from atmospheric moisture with a drying tube containing calcium chloride. The mixture, which soon becomes quite hot, is allowed to stand for 1 hour with occasional swirling. It is then heated in an oil bath held at about 125\u00b0 for 9 hours, the remainder of the phosphorus pentoxide mixture being added in four portions during the first 3 hours. During this total 9-hour period the mass is mixed as well as possible with a metal spatula from time to time.\nThe drying tube is replaced by a condenser, and 400 ml. of ethylene chloride (Note 3) is added. The mixture is heated under reflux for several minutes. The flask is closed with a glass stopper and shaken well (Note 4). A thin pad of glass wool is then inserted into the lower part of the flask neck, and the extract is decanted. This extraction and decantation process is repeated with three 100-ml. portions of ethylene chloride. The extracts are combined in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, the solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the molten solid is swirled briefly at 3 mm. pressure until cessation of bubbling indicates complete removal of solvent. The dark oily solid, which is formed on cooling, amounts to 138\u2013143 g. and melts in the range 80\u2013124\u00b0 (sealed tube) (Note 5). This material is purified by dissolving it in the minimum amount (about 200 ml.) of boiling anhydrous benzene (Note 6) and (Note 7) and, after cooling to about 50\u00b0, adding 300 ml. of anhydrous ether (Note 7). After crystallization is well advanced, the mixture is stored at \u22125\u00b0 overnight. The solvent is removed by forcing it under nitrogen pressure either through a 6-mm. glass tube packed with glass wool up to a constriction about 1 in. from the bottom or through a sintered-glass filter stick. Residual solvent is removed at 3-mm. pressure through a stopcock which is then closed to permit storage of the anhydride at low pressure (Note 8). The yield is 77\u2013114 g. (47\u201370%) of light brown or gray prisms. The product, which softens at about 90\u00b0 and melts at 110\u2013127\u00b0 (sealed tube) (Note 5), is sufficiently pure for most purposes (Note 9)."

            "A. 3-Amino-2,4,6-tribromobenzoic acid. The bromination apparatus consists of a 2-l. three-necked standard-taper flask A, equipped with a \"Trubore\" stirrer and attached by rubber stoppers and glass tubing to two filter flasks, B and C, as shown in Fig. 17. The 250-ml. flask C, which serves as a bubbler and trap, is half-filled with water, and its side arm is connected to a water pump. The reaction flask A is charged with 27.4 g. (0.2 mole) of m-aminobenzoic acid (Note 1), 165 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 780 ml. of water, after which it is surrounded by an ice bath, and the stirrer is started. One hundred and forty grams (45 ml., 0.88 mole) of bromine is placed in the vaporization flask B, which is then surrounded by a water bath heated to 40\u201350\u00b0. Bromine vapor is drawn through the reaction mixture at a moderate rate by applying suction at the water pump. Stirring and cooling of the mixture are continued throughout the reaction period, during which time the product precipitates (Note 2). The bromination requires about 3 hours and is complete when the slurry assumes a distinct yellow color.2\nFig. 17.\nThe cream-colored solid is separated at once by filtration and washed thoroughly with water to remove excess bromine water and acids. It is used in the next step without drying. The melting range of the crude product is usually 170\u2013172\u00b0.",
            "B. 2,4,6-Tribromobenzoic acid. A 5-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, is charged with a precooled mixture of 1.02 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 500 ml. of water. Cooling during the reaction period is assisted by the ice-salt bath, but is effected chiefly by periodic additions of large amounts of crushed Dry Ice directly to the reaction mixture. The temperature of the stirred mixture is lowered to \u22125\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0 and 37 g. (0.54 mole) of sodium nitrite is added in small portions over a period of about 15 minutes. Cold 50% hypophosphorous acid (193 ml., 1.86 moles) (Note 3) is then added over a period of 10\u201315 minutes, the temperature still being maintained below \u22125\u00b0. A solution of the bromination product in 1.85 l. of glacial acetic acid is then added to the stirred diazotizing solution from a dropping funnel. During the 1\u20131.25 hours required to complete this addition the temperature is held between \u221210\u00b0 and \u221215\u00b0 (Note 4). Stirring of the slurry is continued for approximately 2 hours longer, and during this period the temperature is allowed to rise gradually to +5\u00b0. The loosely stoppered flask is kept in a refrigerator for 36 hours (Note 5), during which time nitrogen and some oxides of nitrogen are evolved (Caution!). Most of the acetic acid is then removed by volatilization in a current of steam, 3 l. of distillate being collected. During the steam distillation the product starts to precipitate from the clear solution, and nitrogen dioxide and some hydrogen sulfide are given off. The residual liquid is cooled, and the product is collected on a sintered-glass funnel and washed with water. It is next suspended in 800 ml. of water, and approximately 9 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added with shaking to bring it into solution. The yellow liquid is filtered to remove small quantities of insoluble impurities, and the acid is reprecipitated by acidification to pH 1\u20132 with 5% hydrochloric acid, while swirling vigorously. The cream-colored precipitate is separated by filtration, washed with water, and dried. The yield of 2,4,6-tribromobenzoic acid, sufficiently pure for preparative purposes, is 50\u201357.5 g. (70\u201380%), m.p. 192.5\u2013194.5\u00b0 (Note 6)."

Erlenmeyer flask is heated on a steam bath until the solid dissolves (Note 1). o-Nitroaniline (40 g., 0.29 mole) (Note 2) is dissolved in the warm alkali solution. The resulting deep red solution is then cooled to 0\u00b0, and the sodium hypochlorite solution from part A is added slowly with good stirring over the course of 10 minutes (Note 3). The flocculent yellow precipitate is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 200 ml. of water, and air-dried. The crude product weighs 36.0\u201336.5 g. and melts at 66\u201371\u00b0 (Note 4). The product is purified by recrystallization from a solution made up from 45 ml. of 95% ethanol and 15 ml. of water. Material insoluble in the hot solvent is removed by filtration, and the hot filtrate is allowed to cool to room temperature. The yield of yellow benzofurazan oxide is 31.6\u201332.5 g.

The stirrer is started, and the flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath until the temperature of the mixture is 0\u20135\u00b0. After this temperature has been reached, the amine hydrochloride is diazotized by adding dropwise a solution of 14.5 g. of reagent grade sodium nitrite in 50 ml. of water. Stirring is then continued for 1 hour at 0\u20135\u00b0. The yellow-green solution is filtered from traces of insoluble impurities and poured into a 2-l. beaker surrounded by an ice bath. With stirring, a solution of 13 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium azide in 50 ml. of water is added (Note 2). Almost immediately the o-nitrophenylazide begins to precipitate as a light-cream to colorless solid, which is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel after the nitrogen evolution has ceased (15\u201320 minutes). The yield of o-nitrophenylazide, m.p. 52\u201355\u00b0, is 31\u201332 g. (94\u201397%). This crude product can be used for the preparation of benzofurazan oxide in Part B (Note 3).\nThe impure azide is dissolved in 110\u2013120 ml. of 95% ethanol at 50\u201355\u00b0 (Note 4), and 2 g. of activated carbon is added to aid in the removal of impurities. After being filtered through a steam-heated funnel, the warm solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon 14\u201315 g. of the product precipitates as light-yellow prisms, m.p. 53\u201355\u00b0. Concentration (Note 5) of the mother liquor to 30\u201340 ml. by evaporation at room temperature under an air stream causes the separation of an additional 7\u20138 g. of material, m.p. 52\u201354\u00b0 (Note 6). The total yield of purified o-nitrophenylazide is 63\u201369%.\nB. Benzofurazan oxide. A mixture of 16.4 g. (0.1 mole) of o-nitrophenylazide and 30 ml. of reagent grade toluene is placed in a 100-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and is heated on a steam cone. Moderate nitrogen evolution commences immediately and continues for about 3 hours. When there are no more visible signs of gas evolution, the solution is cooled in an ice bath. After a few minutes, precipitation of light straw-colored clusters of prisms commences. About 6 g. of pure product, m.p. 70\u201372\u00b0, is obtained in this manner. Evaporation of the mother liquor yields another 4.5\u20135.5 g. of the oxide, slightly darker in color, m.p. 69\u201371\u00b0, which may be purified by recrystallization from 15 ml. of 70% ethanol to give material having a melting point of 70\u201371\u00b0.

The reactants are then admitted to the column during about 15 minutes (this corresponds to a rate of amide formation of 396\u2013400 g. per hour). Alcohol distils (Note 5) noticeably from the column during the addition and collects in flask G. At the completion of the reaction, 100 ml. of xylene is passed through the hot column to rinse out the residual amide (Note 6). An additional 200 ml. of xylene is added to the receiver C, and solution is effected by warming.

A 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer with glass blade, a dropping funnel, and an outlet tube connected to a gas-absorption trap,2 is charged with a solution of 224 g. (2.0 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexanone (Note 1) in 1 l. of dry carbon tetrachloride. A solution of 179 ml. (297 g., 2.2 moles) of sulfuryl chloride (Note 2) in 300 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride is added from the dropping funnel over a 1-hour period with stirring. The slightly exothermic reaction is moderated by cooling the flask with a bath of water at room temperature. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 2 hours. The yellow solution is then washed successively with three 300-ml. portions of water, two 200-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and one 200-ml. portion of saturated salt solution, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.\nThe solvent is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, first at atmospheric pressure and finally at reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residue is satisfactory for the preparation of 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone described below (part B). Distillation through the column gives, after a small fore-run, 243\u2013248 g.

            "B. 2-Methyl-2-cyclohexenone. (a) Collidine method. The crude (undistilled) 2-chloro-2-methylcyclohexanone prepared as described above (part A) is transferred to a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stout sealed Hershberg wire stirrer and two efficient reflux condensers, one attached to each side neck; and 290 ml. (266 g., 2.2 moles) of 2,4,6-collidine (Note 2) is added rapidly through one of the condensers with stirring. The flask is heated to 145\u2013150\u00b0 (bath temperature) with an oil bath until there ensues a sudden exothermic reaction which results in vigorous boiling of residual carbon tetrachloride. The reaction is essentially complete within 1 minute, and the mixture becomes very viscous with suspended collidine hydrochloride. The heating is discontinued, and, as the reaction mixture cools and becomes viscous enough to impede stirring, a total of 500 ml. of benzene is added cautiously (with vigorous boiling) through a condenser in order to maintain fluidity. The collidine hydrochloride is collected by suction filtration on a 10-cm. sintered glass suction filter, then transferred to a beaker, triturated with 300 ml. of benzene, and refiltered. After repetition of this treatment, the weight of residual salt is about 303 g. (96%).\nThe combined dark-brown filtrates are washed (Note 4) with two 300-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid saturated with sodium chloride, with one 300-ml. portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and with one 300-ml. portion of saturated salt solution, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The benzene is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, and then all material boiling at 70\u201397\u00b0/56 mm. is collected (Note 5). Fractionation of this material through a 20-cm. heated column packed with steel saddles gives, after a fore-run of benzene, 100\u2013109 g.

A 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed Hershberg wire stirrer, a thermometer, and a tube leading to a source of nitrogen, is charged with 26 g. of lithium chloride, 250 ml. of dimethylformamide (Note 7) and crude 2-chloro-2-methylcyclohexanone prepared as described above (part A, half-scale) from 112 g. of 2-methylcyclohexanone. The stirrer is started, the air swept out with nitrogen, and the flask immersed in an oil bath maintained at 100\u00b0. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 100\u00b0 in about 10 minutes, then to 112\u00b0 and back to 105\u00b0 in another 25 minutes. At the end of this time the mixture is cooled, 1-l. each of ether and of 2.5% sulfuric acid is added, and the mixture is stirred for about 4 hours to hydrolyze the dimethylformamide. The aqueous layer is separated, saturated with sodium chloride, and extracted with four 150-ml. portions of ether. These extracts are combined with the original ether layer, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, and then a fraction boiling at 79\u2013107\u00b0/28 mm. is collected. Redistillation through a 20-cm. heated column packed with steel saddles gives 47\u201350 g.

(0.86 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride (Note 1), and the solids are thoroughly mixed. Two hundred and forty-three milliliters of phosphorus oxychloride is added slowly with shaking. A spiral condenser provided with a drying tube is attached to the flask which is then placed in an oil bath preheated to 60\u201370\u00b0. The temperature is slowly (20\u201325 minutes) raised to 100\u00b0, during which time the reaction mixture is occasionally shaken. In the range 100\u2013105\u00b0 the evolution of hydrogen chloride gas increases, and a spontaneous, vigorous refluxing of the phosphorus oxychloride begins. The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath, and the rate of refluxing is controlled by the application of an ice-water bath (Note 2). After the vigorous reaction has subsided (about 5 minutes) the oil bath is replaced, and heating under reflux is continued at 115\u2013120\u00b0 for 1.5 hours.\nAfter the reaction mixture has been cooled, the excess phosphorus oxychloride is distilled under reduced pressure (80\u2013100 mm.) (0.5\u20131.0 hour). Near the end of the distillation the product begins to sublime into the still head. The residual dark-brown oil is poured with stirring into an 800-ml. beaker containing 280\u2013300 g. of crushed ice (Note 3) and (Note 4). The volume of the ice-water mixture is brought to 600 ml. and allowed to stand at 5\u00b0 overnight. The crude light-brown product is filtered by suction and washed with water.\nThe solid is suspended in 300 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide at 15\u00b0 (Note 5). The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, and the solid is filtered by suction and washed with water until the filtrates are no longer alkaline. The procedure is repeated, but stirring is continued for 0.75\u20131.0 hour. After the solid has been filtered by suction, washed, and pressed as dry as possible, it is dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide for 12\u201316 hours.\nThe solid is transferred to a Soxhlet thimble (45 \u00d7 125 cm.) containing a 5-cm. layer of anhydrous sodium carbonate on the bottom (Note 6), and the solid is extracted for 2 to 3 hours with anhydrous ether (700\u2013800 ml.). The total volume of ether is brought to 800\u2013900 ml. The ethereal solution is treated with charcoal and boiled for 10\u201315 minutes under reflux; then the solution is filtered by suction (Note 7). After evaporation of solvent, 30\u201333 g. (35\u201339%) of white 2-chloronicotinonitrile is obtained, m.p. 105\u2013106\u00b0 (Note 8)."

The mixture is heated under reflux on a steam bath with vigorous stirring for 4 hours. After about 2 hours, the reaction mixture becomes practically solid, and the stirrer may have to be stopped. At the end of the reaction time, 1 l. of hot (80\u00b0) water is added to the reaction mixture, and stirring is resumed. After complete solution has taken place, the stirred mixture is heated at 80\u00b0 for 15 minutes and is then neutralized to litmus with glacial acetic acid (Note 4). Additional glacial acetic acid (75 ml.) is added, followed by cautious addition of a solution of 64.8 g. (0.94 mole) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 70 ml. of water. The rose-red nitroso compound separates almost immediately as an expanded precipitate which almost stops the stirrer. After a few minutes the nitroso compound is removed by filtration and washed twice with a small amount of ice water. The moist material is transferred back to the 3-l. flask, and 430 ml. of warm water (50\u00b0) is added.\nThis procedure should be conducted in a good hood. The slurry is stirred while being heated on a steam bath, and solid sodium hydrosulfite is added until the red color of the nitroso compound is completely bleached (Note 5). Then an additional 30 g. of sodium hydrosulfite is added; the light tan suspension is stirred with heating for 15 minutes more and is allowed to cool. The dense diaminouracil bisulfite is filtered from the cooled solution, washed well with water, and partially dried.\nThe crude product is readily purified by conversion to its hydrochloride salt. The bisulfite salt is transferred to a wide-mouthed 1-l. flask, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the consistency of the resulting mixture is such as to permit mechanical stirring (100 to 200 ml. of acid). The slurry is heated on a steam bath with stirring for 1 hour (Hood!).

            "A. Ethoxymagnesiummalonic ester (Note 1). In a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel and an efficient reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube are placed 5.0 g. (0.2 g. atom) of magnesium turnings (Grignard), 5 ml. of absolute alcohol (Note 2), 0.2 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, and 6 ml. of a mixture of 32.0 g. (30.2 ml., 0.2 mole) of diethyl malonate (Note 3) and 16 ml. of absolute alcohol. The reaction will proceed in a few minutes and may require occasional cooling before the addition of the remainder of the diethyl malonate solution. The addition should be controlled so that the reaction goes at a fairly vigorous rate. When the reaction mixture has cooled to room temperature, 60 ml. of ether dried over sodium wire is cautiously (Note 4) added. When the reaction again appears to subside, gentle heating by means of a steam bath is begun and continued until nearly all the magnesium has disappeared (Note 5). The alcohol and ether are removed by distillation, first at atmospheric pressure and then at reduced pressure secured with a water pump. To the partially crystalline product is added 60 ml. of dry benzene, and the solvent is again removed by distillation at atmospheric and then reduced pressure (Note 6). The residue is dissolved in 60 ml. of dry ether to await the completion of the mixed carbonic-carboxylic anhydride preparation.",
            "B. Mixed benzoic-carbonic anhydride (Note 7). In a 500-ml. three-necked flask, equipped with a low-temperature thermometer, an efficient sealed stirrer, and an adaptive joint carrying a drying tube and a dropping funnel, is placed a solution of 24.4 g. (0.2 mole) of benzoic acid (Note 8) and 20.2 g. (0.2 mole) of triethylamine (Note 9) in 200 ml. of dry toluene. The solution is cooled below 0\u00b0 by means of an ice-salt mixture, and 21.7 g. (0.2 mole) of ethyl chlorocarbonate (Note 10) is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0\u00b0 (approximate time for addition is 25\u201330 minutes). Triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates both during the addition and while the mixture is stirred for 15\u201325 minutes thereafter.",
            "C. Diethyl benzoylmalonate. The dropping funnel used for the chlorocarbonate addition is replaced by another into which the ethereal solution of the ethoxymagnesium compound has been transferred. Approximately 30 ml. of dry ether is used to rinse the flask, and this is also added to the dropping funnel. The ether solution is added to the mixed anhydride with stirring, as the temperature is held at \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0. After the mixture has been allowed to stand overnight and to come to room temperature during this time, it is treated cautiously with 400 ml. of 5% sulfuric acid; then the aqueous solution is separated and extracted once with ether. The two organic layers are combined, washed once with dilute sulfuric acid and then with a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution until no further benzoic acid is obtained from acidification of the bicarbonate extracts (Note 11). The organic layer is washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of the sodium sulfate by filtration, the solvent is removed at water-pump pressure from a water bath held at about 50\u00b0. The resulting product is purified by distillation through a 30-cm. Vigreux column, and the fraction boiling at 144\u2013149\u00b0/0.8 mm. is collected (Note 12). The yield is 35.8\u201339.4 g.

            "A 3-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer prepared from tantalum wire, a condenser arranged for distillation, and a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is heated on a steam cone, and a slow stream of nitrogen is introduced from a cylinder through a line connected to the top of the dropping funnel. To the flask are added 98.1 g. (1.50 g. atoms) (Note 1) of freshly sandpapered zinc foil which has been cut into narrow strips and rolled loosely, and 750 ml. of thiophene-free benzene previously dried over sodium. To dry the apparatus and contents, 175\u2013200 ml. of benzene is slowly distilled with stirring. Heating is interrupted, and the condenser is quickly arranged for reflux. A U-tube just closed with mercury is attached to the top of the condenser, and nitrogen flow is adjusted so that it bubbles slowly through the mercury. The benzene is heated once again to reflux, and a solution of 64.1 g. (0.50 mole) of 2-ethylhexanal (Note 2) and 271.5 g. (1.50 moles) of ethyl \u03b1-bromopropionate (Caution! (Note 3)) in 500 ml. of dried benzene is placed in the dropping funnel. The first 50 ml. of the solution is added to the flask at once. Usually reaction begins immediately, as evidenced by darkening of the zinc surface and clouding of the solution, but in some cases as much as 15 minutes elapses before the start of reaction. When the reaction has started, the remainder of the aldehyde-bromo ester solution is added during 1 hour, with stirring, as the solution is maintained under reflux. After addition is complete the mixture is heated for an additional 2 hours under reflux, and then cooled to room temperature.\nThe nitrogen line is removed, and to the solution is added 750 ml. of 12N sulfuric acid; the resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hour, and then decanted into a 3-l. separatory funnel. After the two phases have separated, the lower aqueous layer is drawn off into a 3-l. separatory funnel containing 1 l. of water which has been used to wash the reaction flask, and the diluted mixture is extracted twice with 350-ml. portions of benzene which have also been employed to rinse the reaction flask. The original organic layer and the combined benzene extracts are kept separate and are washed successively with 500-ml. portions of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and again with water. The two organic portions are now combined, allowed to stand over anhydrous sodium sulfate until clear, then transferred to a 2-l. distilling flask, from which solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure, last traces under aspirator pressure. The residue remaining in the flask weighs 150\u2013165 g. (Note 4) and is dehydrated without further purification.\nTo the residue which contains the crude hydroxy ester there is added 710 g. of pyridine (commercial reagent, C.P. grade), and the mixture is cooled to about 5\u00b0 in an ice bath. To the cooled solution is added slowly with vigorous swirling 155 g. of phosphorus oxychloride (commercial reagent, C.P.); white crystals form almost immediately. The mixture is allowed to stand 8 hours at room temperature and is finally heated for 1.5 hours on the steam bath (Note 5). It is then cooled to room temperature and decanted into a 5-l. separatory funnel containing 1.25 kg. of cracked ice. Crystals that remain in the flask are decomposed with an additional 125 g. of ice. The flask is rinsed with 1.5 l. of water, and then with 400 ml. of hexane. These washes are added to the material in the separatory funnel. After the two layers have been shaken together thoroughly and then separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with two additional 400-ml. portions of fresh hexane. The three hexane extracts are not combined, but are washed in turn with two 500-ml. portions of 2N hydrochloric acid to remove pyridine. Excess hydrochloric acid is removed by washing with three 200-ml. portions of water to pH 4. The clear amber-colored solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and solvent is removed by distillation as before. The residue, which weighs 120\u2013135 g. and consists mainly of ethyl 4-ethyl-2-methyl-2-(and-3-)octenoates, is not distilled but is heated with sulfuric acid to convert the \u03943-isomer to \u03b3-lactone (Note 6), (Note 7), and (Note 8).\nTo the residue is added 600 ml. of ethylene glycol, followed by 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture is heated under vigorous reflux for 20 hours, and then cooled and transferred to a 2-l. stainless-steel or copper flask. To this material is added a solution prepared from 325 g. of potassium hydroxide, 300 ml. of water, and 300 ml. of 95% ethanol. The resultant solution is heated under reflux for 1 hour, and then cooled and transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, where it is diluted with 3 l. of water and acidified with 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The organic liquid which separates is diluted with 300 ml. of hexane and separated from the aqueous layer, which is extracted three additional times with 300-ml. portions of hexane. The hexane extracts are washed to pH 4 with three 300-ml. portions of water, and then combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. For removal of solvent by flash distillation, a 150-ml. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a ground joint attached to a distillation head and side tubulature attached to a dropping funnel, is heated by an oil bath whose temperature is maintained at 130\u2013140\u00b0. After all the solution has been added at about the rate of distillation, the dropping funnel is replaced by a capillary, and the last of the solvent is removed at reduced pressure furnished by a water pump. The flask is finally attached to an efficient fractionating column (Note 9), and the residue of mixed \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acid and \u03b3-lactone is distilled carefully at reduced pressure. After 1\u20135 g. of fore-run, there are obtained 25\u201328.5 g. (27\u201331%) of 4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyloctanoic acid, \u03b3-lactone, b.p. 118\u2013121\u00b0/5.0 mm., nD25 1.4469\u20131.4473 (Note 10), 2\u20133 g. of intermediate, and 27.5\u201332 g. (30\u201335%) of 4-ethyl-2-methyl-2-octenoic acid, b.p. 140\u2013143\u00b0/5.0 mm., nD25 1.4613\u20131.4625 (Note 11)."

The flask is closed, except for a tube containing calcium chloride, and immersed in a water bath maintained at room temperature (Note 3). Stirring is continued for 2.5 hours (Note 4); then the reaction mixture is poured into 1.2 l. of ice water layered over with 300 ml. of ether (Note 5). After separation of the upper layer, the aqueous phase is extracted with four 100-ml. portions of ether.

            "In a 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 86 g. (1 mole) of \u03b3-butyrolactone (Note 1) and 72 g. (1.1 moles) of potassium cyanide (Note 2). As the contents of the flask are stirred, the mixture is heated in an oil bath for 2 hours at a temperature of 190\u2013195\u00b0 (Note 3). There is an initial vigorous reaction which soon subsides. After the completion of the heating period the mixture is cooled to about 100\u00b0, and the potassium salt of the cyano acid is dissolved in about 200 ml. of hot water. The warm solution is cautiously acidified to Congo red by the addition of about 90 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resultant solution, which contains glutaric acid monoamide and potassium chloride, is used to prepare glutaric acid or glutarimide.\nA. Glutaric acid. To the solution of monoamide is added 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is heated under reflux in the hood for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is dried by brief heating on a steam bath at reduced pressure. The residual crystalline solid is broken up, ground in a mortar, and extracted with four 200-ml. portions of boiling chloroform. The combined hot extracts are filtered by gravity through a fluted paper on a heated funnel and then concentrated to about 400 ml. After the solution has been cooled in water to effect crystallization, the glutaric acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with cold chloroform, and dried. The yield of slightly discolored glutaric acid, suitable for many purposes, is 105\u2013110 g. (79.5\u201383.5%), m.p. 95\u201397\u00b0.\nIf a pure grade of glutaric acid is desired, it is decolorized by boiling for about 1 hour with 10 g. of charcoal in water solution. The charcoal is removed by filtration (Note 4), the water is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the dry residue is recrystallized from chloroform. The yield of white glutaric acid, m.p. 98\u201399\u00b0, is 94\u201399 g. (71\u201375%).\nB. Glutarimide. The solution containing the monoamide is extracted with six 50-ml. portions of ether. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (or by filtering by gravity through a layer of the drying agent), and then the ether is evaporated by heating on a steam bath; the last portion is removed at reduced pressure. The oily residue of glutaric acid monoamide is placed in a 300-ml. round-bottomed flask which is fitted with a bent tube attached to a short condenser, and the flask is immersed in a bath (Note 5) held at 220\u2013225\u00b0. Heating is continued until water no longer distils (3\u20134 hours). The cooled glutarimide is dissolved in about 200 ml. of water, and the solution is boiled for about 30 minutes with about 2 g. of charcoal. The charcoal is removed by filtration, water is removed by distillation at reduced pressure, and the dry residue is crystallized from about 125 ml. of 95% ethanol, with final cooling in an ice bath. The yield of glittering white crystals of glutarimide, m.p. 152\u2013154\u00b0, is 65.5\u201373.5 g. (58\u201365%) (Note 6).",
            "In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 400 ml. of 0.2N nitric acid (5 ml. of concentrated nitric acid, sp. gr. 1.42, and 395 ml. of water) and 168.3 g. (2 moles) of dihydropyran (Note 1). The mixture is heated on a steam bath or a boiling water bath; the yellowish upper layer dissolves suddenly after 25 to 45 minutes of heating. The flask is swirled to aid the dissolution at this time, and the period of heating is extended for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhile the hydrolysis of the dihydropyran is taking place, 800 g. (575 ml., 9.25 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask and cooled in an ice-salt bath in a well-ventilated hood. The flask should be equipped with an efficient stirrer, separatory funnel, reflux condenser, and a thermometer. When the temperature of the solution reaches 0\u00b0, 5.75 g. of sodium nitrite is added and stirring is continued until most of it has dissolved; the solution becomes yellow.\nThe solution obtained by the hydrolysis of dihydropyran is placed in the separatory funnel, and about 10 ml. is added to the nitric acid solution at a temperature below 0\u00b0. After the evolution of brown nitrogen dioxide fumes begins (in about 10 minutes), the addition is continued at a rate that allows the temperature to be held below 10\u00b0 (Note 2). The addition requires about 3 hours (Note 3) and (Note 4). When the addition is completed, the blue-green solution is stirred for an additional 1.5 hours as brown fumes continue to be evolved. The cooling bath then is removed and stirring is continued as the temperature is allowed to rise slowly to 25\u201330\u00b0 (Note 5). As the reaction nears completion, the color changes from blue-green to green to light yellow. Appearance of the light yellow color indicates the end of the reaction and normally requires 2 to 3 hours after the addition is completed. The volume of the solution then is reduced either by evaporation on a steam bath or by distillation under reduced pressure.\nIn the latter method, after removal of all the water, an additional 100 ml. of water is added and the distillation is repeated to remove the remaining nitric acid. The solid residue remaining from either method of removing water from the reaction mixture is recrystallized from a mixture of 100 ml. of ether and 1 l. of benzene. Insoluble sodium nitrate and succinic acid are removed by filtration of the hot solution. Upon cooling, 185\u2013198 g. (70\u201375%) of glutaric acid is obtained in the first crop, m.p. 89.5\u201391.5\u00b0 (Note 6). On concentrating the benzene solution to 200 ml. and cooling, an additional 18\u201323 g. of crude glutaric acid can be obtained (Note 7)."

The third neck of the flask is closed with a stopper, and the mixture is heated and stirred vigorously under reflux until the ether has dissolved (Note 2). At the end of this time, heating is discontinued, and 60 ml. of concentrated C.P. hydrochloric acid is cautiously added to the solution. The mixture is then boiled with stirring until sulfur dioxide is no longer evolved. Solid barium chloride dihydrate (or a 10% aqueous solution of this salt) is added to the hot solution (Note 3) until all sulfate has been precipitated; then the barium sulfate is removed by suction filtration through a layer of filter aid.\nThe filtered solution is diluted to 21. with water and passed through a column of ion-exchange resin (Note 4) and (Note 5). A test portion of the effluent should yield no ash on evaporation and ignition of the residue. The column is washed with water until the effluent is no longer acid to litmus, and the washings are added to the original eluent. The total eluent is evaporated (Note 6) at reduced pressure (water aspirator) until the volume is about 250 ml.; then it is transferred to a 500-ml. pot which is equipped for vacuum distillation and attached to a short Vigreux column. After most of the remaining water and hydrochloric acid have been removed at the pressure obtainable with an aspirator, an oil pump is attached (Note 7), and the heating bath is cautiously raised to a temperature in the range 130\u2013150\u00b0.

The flask is immersed to two-thirds its depth in an oil bath, in a forced-draft hood, and the bath is heated, cautiously as 190\u00b0 is approached. In the range 190\u2013215\u00b0, a very vigorous exothermic reaction sets in (sometimes after a brief delay), and considerable gas and vapor is expelled through the air condenser. The vigorous reaction abates in 5 minutes or less, and the oil bath is raised to about 230\u00b0. After heating at this temperature has been continued for 30 minutes, the flask is removed from the bath and cooled to room temperature.\nA mixture of 50 ml. of methanol and 20 ml. of water is cautiously added to the cooled reaction mixture, and this is followed by slow addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 4) until the pH is brought to 1\u20132 (Hydrion test paper). When effervescence has stopped, 50 ml. of water is added, and the contents of the flask are boiled gently for 1 hour. Additional concentrated hydrochloric acid is added as needed to maintain the specified pH (Note 5). At this point, all solid material should have been decomposed. The mixture is transferred to a 600-ml. beaker, using 10 ml. of methanol to wash out the flask, sufficient sodium hydroxide is added (Note 6) to bring the pH to about 3 (Hydrion test paper or more accurately with methyl orange indicator), and water is added to bring the volume to about 300 ml. The mixture is stirred in an ice bath until the oily layer solidifies, and the crude crystalline material is collected by suction filtration at about 15\u00b0 and washed with 100 ml. of water. After vacuum drying at 70\u00b0, the yield of crude product is 16\u201319 g., but this material should be purified before further use.\nThe crude product is distilled in a short-path distillation apparatus composed of a 125-ml.

            "Eight hundred fifty milliliters of absolute methanol (magnesium-dried) is distilled directly, through a condenser, into a 1-l. three-necked reaction flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser protected by a drying tube. After about 300 ml. of methanol has been distilled, the drying tube is removed from the reflux condenser, and small pieces of clean sodium are added to the stirred methanol at such a rate that the alcohol vapors do not escape from the condenser (Note 1). When a total of 23 g. (1 g. atom) of sodium has been added, the drying tube is replaced, the distillation of methanol is completed (Note 1), and the system is brought to a temperature of 20\u201325\u00b0 (other temperatures are less favorable). The inlet condenser is removed, 30 g. (0.5 mole) of dry finely ground urea (Note 2) is quickly added to the reaction mixture, and the opening is then closed by attaching a dropping funnel. When the urea has dissolved completely, the addition of 70 g. (0.48 mole) of diethyl oxalate (Note 2) is begun (Note 3). A white precipitate forms immediately. Stirring is continued for 1 hour after the addition of the ester has been completed (Note 4). One hundred milliliters of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added dropwise to the mixture at a rate that causes little increase in the solution temperature, stirring is continued for a few minutes, and the mixture is filtered. The residue is washed twice with a small quantity of methanol, and the filtrate and washings are transferred to a 2-l. two-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer and a vacuum take-off. The alcohol is removed under the reduced pressure of a good water aspirator (Note 5). The practically dry solid residue is washed from the evaporator with water which is used as the recrystallization solvent (Note 6). When the bulk of the solid has dissolved, the solution is cooled slightly below the boiling point, 2 g. of activated carbon is added, and the solution is filtered through a hot B\u00fcchner funnel by use of moderate suction. The solution yields a white, crystalline precipitate of parabanic acid upon standing in a refrigerator overnight. The yield of purified, dried product melting at 241\u2013243\u00b0 with decomposition is 39\u201341.5 g. (71.5\u201376%)."

(0.26 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), 165 ml. of \"deoxygenated\" water (Note 1), and 64 g. (0.5 mole) of 2-ethoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (b.p. 62\u201365\u00b0/50 mm., nD25 1.4378) (Note 2). The mixture is stirred vigorously for 20 minutes and then allowed to stand for 1 hour.\nTo the resulting colorless solution of glutaraldehyde are added, in order, 350 ml. of water, 50 g. (0.74 mole) of commercial methylamine hydrochloride dissolved in 500 ml. of water, 83 g. (0.57 mole) of acetonedicarboxylic acid (Note 3) dissolved in 830 ml. of water, and a solution of 88 g. (0.25 mole) of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate and 7.3 g. (0.18 mole) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 200 ml. of water by heating. Carbon dioxide is evolved, and the pH of the solution, initially 2.5, increases to 4.5 after the mixture has been stirred under nitrogen for 24 hours. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (33 ml.) is added, and the solution is heated on the steam bath for 1 hour to complete the decarboxylation (Note 4). After the solution has been cooled to room temperature, 75 g. of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water is added (Note 5), and the basic mixture is extracted with eight 250-ml. portions of methylene chloride (Note 6). The combined methylene chloride extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated to about 500 ml. (Note 7), and filtered through a layer of 400 g. of alumina (Note 8) packed in a 50-mm. column. The column is eluted with methylene chloride until about 1.5 l. of eluate has been collected. The eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure to yield crystalline but yellow pseudopelletierine. The solid is sublimed at 40\u00b0 and 0.3 mm. to yield 47\u201355.5 g. (61\u201373%) of crude, nearly colorless pseudopelletierine (Note 9). The product is dissolved in 100 ml. of boiling pentane, 3 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is boiled until the aqueous layer disappears. After thorough chilling in a refrigerator, the crystals which separate are collected on a filter and washed well with ice-cold pentane. Evaporation of the combined filtrate and washings to 20 ml., followed by filtration and washing, yields a second crop of almost equally pure material. The combined pseudopelletierine hemihydrate weighs 47\u201355 g. and melts at 47\u201348.5\u00b0. Sublimation of the hemihydrate as described above removes the water of hydration and yields 44\u201352 g. (58\u201368%) of pure, colorless pseudopelletierine, m.p. 63\u201364\u00b0 (sealed tube). Anhydrous material which has been prepared in this manner does not decompose on storage under dry conditions."

(0.35 mole) of oleic acid of at least 95% purity (Note 1) in 400 ml. of dry ether maintained at 0\u20135\u00b0, until the color of bromine persists. About 53 g. (0.33 mole) of bromine is needed; the excess is removed by addition of a few drops of oleic acid.\nThe sodamide required for dehydrobromination is prepared2 in a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed Hershberg stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a large cold-finger condenser charged with Dry Ice-acetone. The condenser outlet is connected to a safety trap followed by a bubbler tube containing concentrated aqueous ammonia. Liquid ammonia (1.9 l., (Note 2)) is introduced into the flask through the inlet tube (Hood!); then 1.6 g. of anhydrous ferric chloride (c.p., black) is added in one portion with vigorous stirring. After 5\u201310 minutes, 3 g. of sodium is dropped into the brown solution to convert the iron salt into the catalytic form. After the evolution of hydrogen has ceased, the remainder of the sodium (total 43 g., 1.87 g. atoms) is added in small pieces with continued stirring. Gray, grainy crystals of sodamide settle out as the reaction proceeds.\nThe ethereal solution of dibromostearic acid, prepared as described above, is introduced slowly from a dropping funnel into the reaction flask. After the reaction has been allowed to proceed for 6 hours with continuous stirring, 60 g. of solid ammonium chloride (1.12 moles) is added in portions to destroy excess sodamide. The ammonia is allowed to evaporate until there remains a dry-appearing solid, and then 1 l. of water is added. The mixture is warmed to 60\u201370\u00b0 under nitrogen (Note 3) and acidified by the addition of an excess (50 ml.) of concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is removed by siphoning, and the organic layer is washed with four 500-ml. portions of hot (60\u00b0) water. The aqueous layer is separated each time by siphoning. After the fourth washing, the oily product is solidified by cooling the flask in an ice bath, and the residual water is drained off. The crude product is dried on the steam bath under vacuum (Note 4).\nThe crude acid is dissolved in 500 ml. of petroleum ether at room temperature. The small amount of amorphous solid which may separate is removed by filtration through Supercel, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to 300 ml. Chilling to 0\u20135\u00b0 yields a first crop of tan crystals which is collected by suction filtration and washed with the minimum amount of ice-cold petroleum ether. Concentration of the mother liquors to 150 ml. and chilling yields a second crop of brownish crystals. The combined crops are dissolved in 300 ml. of petroleum ether, and the light-red solution is chilled to 0\u20135\u00b0. The almost white to light-tan crystals are collected, washed with a small amount of cold petroleum ether, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. There is obtained 51.5\u201361.5 g. (52\u201362%) of stearolic acid, m.p. 46\u201346.5\u00b0 (Note 5)."

When the naphthol has gone into solution (about 10 minutes), 20.8 g. (3.0 g. atoms) of lithium metal (Note 4) is added in small pieces and at such a rate as to prevent the ammonia from refluxing too violently (Note 5).

During this period the benzyltrimethylammonium chloride is prepared.\nA solution of 379.5 g. (3 moles) of benzyl chloride (Note 4) dissolved in 750 g. of anhydrous ethanol (Note 3) is placed in flask B. The system is flushed with trimethylamine previously dried by passage through a soda-lime tower. The gas outlet is closed and connected to the manometer. Over a period of 80 minutes, 195 g. (3.3 moles) of trimethylamine (Note 5) is introduced with stirring. The reaction is exothermic and must be cooled to keep the temperature below 50\u00b0. After the amine addition is complete, the solution is kept at 50\u00b0 under an amine pressure of 5 cm. of mercury above atmospheric pressure for 1 hour. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature under an amine atmosphere.\nThe inlet tube of flask B is replaced by a rubber stopper bearing a short glass outlet tube and a glass inlet tube which is connected to an appropriately designed glass siphon outlet tube extending to the bottom of flask A. Gentle suction applied to the outlet tube of flask B draws the ethoxide solution slowly into flask B. The benzyltrimethylammonium chloride solution is stirred throughout the addition of the sodium ethoxide. After the transfer of the sodium ethoxide is completed, the finely divided precipitate of sodium chloride is allowed to settle overnight. When the sodium chloride has completely settled, the stopper bearing the inlet and outlet tubes is replaced by a stopper bearing a 15-in. length of 19-mm. glass tubing which is attached in turn by a gum rubber connection to a clean, dry, 1-gal. bottle fitted with an inlet tube and an outlet tube protected by soda-lime. The bottle is flushed with nitrogen before use. The 15-in. tube is adjusted so that the bottom is approximately \u00bd in. above the level of the precipitated sodium chloride. With the open-end manometer sealed off by a screw clamp, nitrogen pressure is applied through the outlet tube of the flask until 1.7\u20131.9 kg. of supernatant liquor is forced from the flask into the bottle (Note 6). This solution contains 24\u201330% benzyltrimethylammonium ethoxide (2.1\u20132.7 moles), as determined by titration with 0.1N hydrochloric acid, using methyl red as indicator. This represents a yield of 70\u201390%. An additional 270\u2013400 g. of solution is obtained by filtration of the residual mixture under nitrogen. To ensure rapid filtration, a filter aid, such as Filtercel (Note 7), must be employed. The filtrate contains 24\u201330% benzyltrimethylammonium ethoxide (0.3\u20130.7 mole). The total yield is 89\u2013100%. The solutions are stored under nitrogen and refrigeration in bottles sealed with rubber stoppers which are wired in place (Note 8).\nThree hundred and thirty-five grams of the 25% ethanolic solution of benzyltrimethylammonium ethoxide (0.43 mole) is placed under nitrogen in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a gas inlet tube, a gas-tight modified Hershberg stirrer (Note 1), and a gas outlet tube fitted with a thermometer. All stoppers and rubber connections are wired in place with 16-gauge copper wire. There is obtained by evaporation at 40\u00b0 (Note 9) under reduced pressure (Note 10) 97 g. (0.40 mole) of the ethoxide containing an equivalent of ethanol. The vacuum is broken with dry nitrogen."

In a 200-ml. three-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with an efficient reflux condenser bearing a suitable trap for absorbing hydrogen bromide, a 100-ml. separatory funnel, and a ball-joint or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer are placed 68.5 g. (0.5 mole) of p-nitrotoluene (Note 1) and 1.0 g. of iron powder. The mixture is heated to 75\u201380\u00b0 by means of a water bath, vigorous stirring is begun, and 30.5 ml. (94.8 g., 0.59 mole) of bromine is added over the course of 30 minutes. After the addition of bromine is complete, the reaction mixture is maintained at 75\u201380\u00b0 with continuation of stirring for an additional 1.5 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is poured with vigorous stirring into 750 ml. of ice-cold 10% sodium hydroxide solution, the solid is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is decanted. To the residue is added 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and the mixture is heated until the solid is completely melted. The two liquid phases are thoroughly mixed by stirring, the mixture is cooled to 5\u00b0 in an ice bath, and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The product is then heated with 500 ml. of 10% acetic acid until molten, stirred thoroughly, and cooled to room temperature. The aqueous liquor is decanted, and the cycle is repeated with 500 ml. of 1% sodium hydroxide solution (Note 2). The solid 2-bromo-4-nitrotoluene is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and thoroughly washed with water. The moist product may be used directly in the next stage of the synthesis. It can be dried to yield 93\u201397 g. (86\u201390%) of light-brown material melting at 75\u201376\u00b0.",
            "B. 2-Bromo-3-methylbenzoic acid. Caution! This procedure must be carried out in a hood with a good draft, because poisonous hydrogen cyanide is evolved.

A reflux condenser is attached, and the mixture is boiled for 16 hours (Note 4). To the hot, dark-red solution is then added 1.5 l. of water, and the mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. (Caution! Hydrogen cyanide is evolved.) The acidified mixture is boiled for 15 minutes to expel hydrogen cyanide and then allowed to cool to 35\u201340\u00b0. Five grams of diatomaceous earth is stirred in, and the mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel precoated with a little diatomaceous earth. The solid is discarded, and the filtrate is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined and extracted with three 100-ml. portions of 5% ammonium carbonate solution. The basic extracts are combined, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and cooled in an ice bath. The oil which first forms soon crystallizes.\nThe tarry solid is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 50 ml. of water, and dried. The dried solid is pulverized and boiled under reflux for 3 hours with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0). The hot mixture is then filtered (fluted filter paper), and the solid is discarded.

(0.50 mole) of p-chloroaniline and 111 g. (0.75 mole) of triethyl orthoformate (Note 1), and then 2.0 g. (0.02 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added with mixing. The flask is attached to a 30-cm. column 2 cm. in diameter packed with glass helices (Note 2), which is surmounted by a distillation head equipped with a thermometer and condenser. A thermometer is connected through a slip joint made from a short section of rubber tubing to the side tubulature so that its bulb is in the reaction mixture; then the flask is heated in an oil bath. When the temperature of the oil bath reaches 115\u2013120\u00b0, the reaction mixture begins to boil, and ethanol soon begins to distil at a vapor temperature of 78\u201380\u00b0 at the top of the column. During the course of about 1 hour the bath temperature is raised to about 175\u00b0. This promotes a steady distillation of ethanol at a rate which begins to decrease after 30 minutes. The amount of ethanol that distils (70\u201375 ml.) is always in excess of the stoichiometric amount. Finally, the reaction mixture is kept in the oil bath at 175\u2013180\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 3); an additional small amount of volatile material distils during this time.\nAfter the reaction mixture has cooled somewhat the flask is disconnected from the column, a Claisen head is attached, and the product is distilled at reduced pressure (Note 4). After a fore-run of about 20 g. (not readily condensed below 40 mm. pressure), the faintly yellow product is collected at 124\u2013126\u00b0/3 mm., weight 73\u201379 g.

            "A 500-ml. round-bottomed flask is attached by a well-lubricated ground-glass joint to a reflux condenser with a side take-off having a stopcock which may be opened to permit distillation. In the flask are placed 170 ml. of commercial diethylene glycol and 30 g. (0.46 mole) of potassium hydroxide (U.S.P., or reagent grade, 85%). This mixture is heated carefully (Caution! (Note 1)) until the potassium hydroxide begins to melt and go into solution; then the heat is removed intermittently until the exothermic dissolution is completed. After the solution has been cooled to 80\u2013100\u00b0, the condenser is removed and there are added to the flask 35 g. (0.152 mole) of 6-ketohendecanedioic acid (p. 555) and 22 ml. (22.4 g., 0.38 mole) of commercial 85% hydrazine hydrate. The condenser is immediately replaced, and the mixture is warmed cautiously until any exothermic reaction is complete and then heated under reflux for 1 hour.\nA thermometer is suspended through the condenser by copper wire so that the bulb is in the heated liquid, the stopcock of the take-off attachment is opened, and the mixture is distilled sufficiently slowly so that the froth does not rise out of the flask. When the liquid temperature has reached 205\u2013210\u00b0 (after about 30 ml. of distillate has been collected), the stopcock in the takeoff is closed, the thermometer is removed, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 3 hours. If the temperature is checked during this heating period, it is usually found to be in the range 190\u2013200\u00b0.\nAt the end of the heating period the reaction mixture is cooled to about 100\u2013110\u00b0 (at lower temperatures a gelatinous precipitate separates) and is then poured into 150 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. An additional 100 ml. of water is used to rinse the reaction flask. The diluted mixture is acidified to Congo red by slow addition of 6N hydrochloric acid as the mixture is stirred vigorously to ensure conversion of any precipitated potassium salt to the free acid. The mixture is then cooled by tap water for at least 30 minutes (Note 2). The white precipitate is collected by suction filtration, transferred to a beaker, and is heated with about 250 ml. of water until the solid has melted (Note 3). As the mixture is cooled, it is stirred vigorously by hand until the oil has resolidified. After the mixture has been cooled again, the precipitated acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried (Note 4). The yield of hendecanedioic acid, m.p. 110.5\u2013112\u00b0 (Note 5), is 28.5\u201330.6 g. (87\u201393%)."

The mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel containing about 150 ml. of water and 200 g. of cracked ice. The transfer is completed with the addition of 150 ml. of benzene, and the separatory funnel is shaken vigorously for about 10 minutes, during which time most of the ice melts and the originally denser organic phase becomes the upper phase. The aqueous layer is separated and washed with 100 ml. of benzene, while the organic layer is vigorously shaken with another 200-ml. portion of ice water. This ice-water wash is also shaken with the 100-ml. portion of benzene and is then discarded. The combined benzene extracts are filtered through anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove suspended water; then the benzene and residual bromine are removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator) at a bath temperature of 70\u00b0 or below (Note 7). The crude bromoacyl bromide is added slowly, at room temperature, to a solution of 13.7 g. (0.35 g. atom) of potassium metal (Note 1) in 300 ml. of dry tert-butyl alcohol (Note 1) contained in a well-dried 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser that is protected from moisture with a calcium chloride drying tube. The resultant suspension is heated at reflux for 1 hour, cooled, and diluted with three volumes of water. The mixture, containing insoluble tert-butyl 2-methylenedodecanoate, is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of low-boiling petroleum ether (Note 8) and (Note 9). The combined petroleum ether extracts are washed with water and filtered through anhydrous sodium carbonate into a distilling flask from which the solvent is flash-distilled. The residual tert-butyl 2-methylenedodecanoate is then distilled through a 61-cm. Podbielniak-type column (Note 10) at 129\u2013130\u00b0/3.0 mm.; the yield is 18.5\u201321 g. of semipurified ester, nD25 1.4405\u20131.4413 (Note 11) and (Note 12).\nThe tert-butyl 2-methylenedodecanoate is hydrolyzed by heating under reflux with ethanolic potassium hydroxide for 6 hours; 40 ml. of 95% ethanol and 3.7 g. (0.056 mole) of 85% potassium hydroxide are used for each 10 g. (0.037 mole) of the ester. The hydrolysis mixture is cooled, diluted with three volumes of water, and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether which are discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified to Congo red with 5N sulfuric acid, and the 2-methylenedodecanoic acid is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of low-boiling petroleum ether (Note 8). These extracts are combined, washed with three 100-ml. portions of water to ensure complete removal of tert-butyl alcohol, and dried by filtration through anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation, and the acid is subjected to rapid distillation from a Claisen flask (Note 13). 2-Methylenedodecanoic acid containing less than 5% of 2-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid is collected at 149\u2013151\u00b0/1.7 mm., m.p. about 32\u00b0, \u03bbmax 209 m\u03bc, \u03b5 7800, in hexane (Note 14). The yield is 10.5\u201312 g. (35\u201340% from 2-methyldodecanoic acid), not including the acid obtained on acidification of the dehydrohalogenation mixture (Note 9)."

            "A. Triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate (not isolated). A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. All parts of the apparatus should be scrupulously dry. Three hundred milliliters of anhydrous ethanol (Note 1) is placed in the flask, and 14.1 g. (0.61 g. atom) of clean sodium, cut in pieces as large as will easily pass through a neck of the flask, is added rapidly. The neck of the flask is immediately closed, and the mixture is stirred until all the sodium has dissolved; the cooling bath is removed, and heat is applied if the reaction becomes sluggish at the end.\nAfter all the sodium has dissolved, a mixture of 115 g. (0.72 mole) of diethyl malonate (Note 2) and 60 g. (0.60 mole) of methyl crotonate (Note 2) is added from the separatory funnel. This addition is made as rapidly as is consistent with keeping the exothermic reaction under control. After the exothermic reaction has subsided, the mixture is heated for 1 hour under reflux with stirring. An oil bath is recommended for heating. At the end of the heating period the condenser is changed to a position for distilling, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised sufficiently to distil alcohol fairly rapidly from the stirred mixture. Distillation is continued until most of the alcohol has been distilled. There is left a residue of the sodio derivative of triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate (Note 3). If water is added to obtain the free ester, considerable heat is generated and cooling must be adequate to prevent partial hydrolysis of the ester by the alkali liberated. For present purposes there is no advantage in attempting isolation of the ester, and the residue is processed as described below.",
            "B. \u03b2-Methylglutaric anhydride. The residue described above is cooled in an ice bath during the successive addition of 200 ml. of water and 450 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resultant mixture is heated under reflux, with stirring, for 8 hours (Note 4). The condenser is again set for distillation, the bath temperature is raised, and, with continued stirring, water and alcohol are distilled. The bath is finally heated to 180\u2013190\u00b0 until gas evolution ceases (usually about 1 hour).\nThe stirrer is removed, 125 ml. of technical acetic anhydride is added to the residue, and, after thorough mixing, the mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour. The condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube is left attached, and the other necks of the flask are closed. At the end of the heating period salt is removed from the cooled reaction mixture by filtering it with suction, using a filter aid mat, into a 250-ml. Claisen flask. The reaction vessel and filter are washed with a few milliliters of acetic acid.\nThe combined filtrate and washings are distilled at reduced pressure, using a water pump, until all acetic acid and acetic anhydride have been removed. An oil pump is then connected, and the distillation is continued. \u03b2-Methylglutaric anhydride is collected at 118\u2013122\u00b0/3.5 mm. The yield of semisolid anhydride (Note 5) is 46\u201358 g.

In a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser is placed a solution of 391 g. (6.0 moles) of potassium cyanide in 2.5 l. of water and 258 g. (2.0 moles) of isoquinoline (freshly distilled from zinc dust). The mixture is maintained below 25\u00b0 by immersion in an ice bath (Note 2). The stirrer is started, and, when the isoquinoline has formed an emulsion with the aqueous solution, 562 g. (4.0 moles) of benzoyl chloride is added over 3 hours. The stirring is continued another hour or until the Reissert's compound has separated as small, hard, tan spheres. The reaction mixture is cooled further in the ice bath, and the product is collected on a large B\u00fcchner funnel. It is washed on the funnel with successive portions of 400 ml. of water, 400 ml. of 3N hydrochloric acid, and 500 ml. of water. The product is then recrystallized from 2\u20133 l. of commercial absolute ethanol using 2.5 g. of activated carbon to effect partial decolorization of the solution. The hot filtration to remove the carbon is done by means of a heated B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath and filtered when cold. Long standing in the presence of the supernatant liquid causes the adsorption of dark material by the product. The cream-colored crystals which separate are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel. washed with 100 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and dried in air overnight. The yield of dry 1-cyano-2-benzoyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline, m.p. 125\u2013127\u00b0, sufficiently pure for use in the next step, is 303\u2013400 g. (58\u201377%).",

(5.0 moles) of sodium bicarbonate, and 2.4 l. of water. The mixture is heated on a hot plate at 70\u201380\u00b0 and is maintained at this temperature by switching the hot plate off occasionally, while 484 g. (2.54 moles) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Note 2) is added in portions of 5\u201310 g., with stirring, during 3 hours. When addition is complete, the mixture is heated and stirred at 70\u201380\u00b0 for 1 hour (Note 3). The mixture is then removed from the hot plate and allowed to stand for 4 to (preferably) 10 hours.\nThe solid sodium p-toluenesulfinate which separates is collected by filtration and mixed with 400 g. (4.76 moles) of sodium bicarbonate and 490 g. (370 ml., 3.88 moles) of dimethyl sulfate (Note 4) in a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 1-l. separatory funnel containing 925 ml. of water. Water (75\u2013100 ml.) is added from the separatory funnel to make the mixture fluid enough for stirring. The remainder of the water is then added dropwise, with stirring, during 3 hours. The mixture is then heated under reflux for 20 hours.\nAfter the mixture is cooled to 75\u00b0, 200 ml. of benzene is added (Note 5). The mixture is stirred briefly, and the liquid is decanted from the solid into a 5-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted again with 200 ml. of benzene. The aqueous layer is then returned to the separatory funnel, and the solid in the reaction flask is washed in with it by means of 2 l. of water. The mixture is shaken with 200-ml. portions of benzene until all solid has dissolved (usually three portions of benzene suffice). All the benzene extracts are combined and dried with 20 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. The drying agent is removed by filtration and washed with two 20-ml. portions of benzene. Benzene is removed from the filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 6), and the solid which separates is dried further at about 10 mm. and room temperature to constant weight. The yield (Note 2) of methyl p-tolyl sulfone is 298\u2013317 g. (69\u201373%), m.p. 83\u201387.5\u00b0. Further purification is generally unnecessary, but, if desired, the product may be recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride or ethanol-water (1:1). The submitters state that the method may be extended to the preparation of methyl phenyl sulfone and, presumably, of methyl aryl sulfones generally (Note 7)."

The flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and a graduated dropping funnel containing 147 g. (1.38 moles) of benzaldehyde (Note 2). The mixture in the flask is heated until all the solid dissolves and is then allowed to cool undisturbed (Note 3).\nWhen the solution has cooled to room temperature, stirring is started and 6.6 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added through the open neck of the flask, followed by 30 ml. of benzaldehyde from the dropping funnel. When the precipitate of monobenzalpentaerythritol starts forming, dropwise addition of benzaldehyde is begun (Note 4). After the addition of benzaldehyde is completed, the mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hours (Note 5).

After a reflux period of 1.5 hours, 170 ml. of 48% hydrobromic acid is added and the solution is heated under reflux for an additional 3 hours. At the end of this time 96 ml. of 48% hydrobromic acid is added and the heating under reflux is continued for 3 hours. The solution is distilled under reduced pressure to remove as much of the acetic acid and the water as possible, first on a steam bath and finally for 15 minutes in an oil bath at 140\u2013150\u00b0, as the pressure is reduced to 10 mm. The viscous residue is transferred to a 2-l. flask and treated with 750 ml. of 98% ethanol and 50 ml. of 48% hydrobromic acid. The flask is provided with an efficient fractionating column (Note 3), and the solution is fractionated slowly until about 500 ml. of distillate is collected. Then a second 750-ml. portion of ethanol is added, and the fractionation is continued slowly until 750 ml. more distillate is collected (Note 4). Finally, the flask is fitted with a Claisen head and a condenser set for downward distillation, and the remaining alcohol is removed as completely as possible under reduced pressure.\nBenzene (500 ml.) is added to the residue and distilled at atmospheric pressure. The last traces of benzene are removed by heating for 15 minutes in an oil bath at 150\u00b0, as the pressure is reduced to 8 mm. The same procedure is repeated, using a second 500-ml. portion of benzene (Note 5). The viscous residue is then heated under reflux for several hours with 500 ml. of dry ether, with frequent shaking, until it becomes white and granular (Note 6). After cooling thoroughly, the ether is decanted, and the solid is washed twice with two 200-ml. portions of dry ether. The solid is powdered thoroughly and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The dry solid is then extracted exhaustively in a Soxhlet extractor with 600 ml. of dry ether (Note 7). The ether extract is cooled overnight in an ice bath, and the precipitated monobromopentaerythritol is collected by filtration and washed with two 200-ml. portions of cold, dry ether. The yield of crude product melting at 72\u201373\u00b0 is 145\u2013160 g. (49\u201354% of the theoretical). One recrystallization from a mixture of 3 parts of chloroform and 2 parts of ethyl acetate by volume raises the melting point to 75\u201376\u00b0, recovery 75\u201385%."

The side arm is connected through a calcium chloride drying tower and a bubbler to a nitrogen tank.\nThe top of the condenser is connected to a horizontal tube (ca. 2 \u00d7 25 cm.) partially filled with granular anhydrous calcium chloride. The horizontal tube is then connected to a 100-ml. graduated cylinder immersed in an acetone-Dry Ice mixture for collection of the product. The cylinder is also equipped with an escape tube protected by a calcium chloride drying tube.\nFour hundred grams of powdered technical potassium hydroxide flakes (Note 2) is placed in the flask, and 500 ml. of ethylene glycol is added. This mixture is stirred vigorously while adding 100 ml. of n-butyl Cellosolve (Note 3). The system is swept with a rapid stream of nitrogen for 15\u201320 minutes while the temperature of the oil bath is raised to 165\u2013170\u00b0. The flow of nitrogen is then reduced to a rate just sufficient to maintain an atmosphere of nitrogen in the system.\nOne hundred and twenty-five grams of 1,3-dichloro-2-butene (1.0 mole) (Note 4) is added at a rate of about 3 drops per second. Addition should be complete in 0.75\u20131 hour (Note 5). During the addition the temperature of the oil bath is maintained at 165\u2013170\u00b0 (Note 6), and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously.

            "A 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer, a stirrer, a gas inlet tube which will reach beneath the surface of the liquid, and a vent. The flask is placed in a bath of acetone to which Dry Ice can be added. To the flask are charged 336 g. (318 ml., 4.0 moles) of thiophene (Note 1), 176 g. (177 ml., 1.33 moles) of paraldehyde, and 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. While this mixture is stirred and maintained at 10\u201313\u00b0 (Note 2) by means of Dry Ice, gaseous hydrogen chloride is bubbled in. At the end of 25 minutes the solution is saturated (Note 3).\nThe contents of the flask are poured onto 300 g. of ice, the layers are separated, and the organic portion is washed three times with 200-ml. portions of ice water (Note 4). The organic layer is added, with some cooling (Note 5), to 316 g. (322 ml., 4.0 moles) of pyridine and 2.0 g. of \u03b1-nitroso-\u03b2-naphthol in a 1-l. distilling flask. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ethereal extract is used to wash each aqueous wash in turn (Note 6). The ethereal layer is concentrated on the steam bath under a stream of nitrogen and combined with the organic mixture in the distilling flask. The mixture is allowed to stand for 1.5 hours before distillation. The distillation is performed under reduced nitrogen pressure. The distillate is collected over 1.0 g. of \u03b1-nitroso-\u03b2-naphthol in an ice-cooled receiver at successively lower pressures ending at 125\u00b0/50 mm. (Note 7). The distillate is poured onto a mixture of 400 g. of ice and 400 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The layers are separated, and the organic portion is washed successively with 100-ml. portions of 1% hydrochloric acid, water, and 2% ammonia.\nThe organic layer is filtered through 1 cm. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate on a sintered-glass funnel into a 500-ml. distilling flask. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether which are combined and used to extract the aqueous washes. The ethereal layer is washed with 50 ml. of saturated salt solution and filtered through the same funnel into a fresh suction flask. The funnel is finally washed with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal washes are concentrated on a steam bath under nitrogen (Note 8) and combined with the filtrate in the distilling flask. The filtrate is fractionally distilled under nitrogen through a 2-cm. column, 35 cm. high, packed with 6-mm. glass helices (Note 9). The column is jacketed and provided with a heater inside the jacket to minimize heat losses during distillation. The receiver is cooled in an ice bath, and the distillate is collected in three fractions, thiophene 45.6\u201327.9 g., b.p. 36\u00b0/150 mm.\u201335\u00b0/100 mm.

The apparatus is thoroughly swept with dry nitrogen, and the reaction flask is charged with 1.5 l. of anhydrous ether, dry nitrogen (Note 3) being used for pressure transfer.\nThree hundred thirty-six milliliters (312 g., 3 moles) of methyl borate is distilled directly into the 500-ml. dropping funnel shortly before starting the reaction (Note 4). One liter (544 g., 3 moles) of a 3M ethereal solution of phenylmagnesium bromide is pressure-transferred with dry nitrogen to the 1-l. dropping funnel (Note 5). During subsequent operations until the hydrolysis step, a positive pressure of 10\u201320 mm. of nitrogen is maintained in the closed system by means of a mercury bubbler to prevent access of atmospheric moisture. The ether is cooled to below \u221260\u00b0 by a bath of Dry Ice and acetone and is kept below \u221260\u00b0 all during the reaction (Note 6). The reactants are added to the well-stirred reaction mixture alternately in small portions, first 10 ml. of methyl borate and then 30 ml. of phenylmagnesium bromide, the rate of addition being as rapid as is possible without the temperature of the mixture rising above \u221260\u00b0 (Note 7). Stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes below \u221260\u00b0 after the addition of the reagents is completed.\nThe stirred mixture, maintained at or below 0\u00b0, is hydrolyzed by the addition of 200 ml. of distilled water during 5 minutes. It is then neutralized by addition of a solution of 84 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.7 l. of distilled water during 15 minutes. The mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, the ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether.\nThe combined ether layer and extracts are transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer,3 a dropping funnel, a Claisen head with a water-cooled condenser, an electric heating mantle, and an ice-cooled receiver (Note 8). After approximately one-half of the ether has been removed by distillation from the stirred mixture, 1.5 l. of distilled water is added slowly while the distillation is continued until a head temperature of 100\u00b0 is reached (Note 9).\nWhile stirring is continued, the aqueous distilland is cooled in an ice bath (Note 10). The benzeneboronic acid, which separates as small white crystals, is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with petroleum ether. The petroleum ether removes traces of dibenzeneborinic acid, which are seen in the hot mother liquor as globules of brown oil and which may color the product. The acid is dehydrated to benzeneboronic anhydride by heating it in an oven at 110\u00b0 and atmospheric pressure for 6 hours (Note 11). Benzeneboronic anhydride is obtained as a colorless solid, weight 240\u2013247 g. (77\u201379%) (Note 12), m.p. 214\u2013216\u00b0."

With good stirring, hydrogen sulfide is passed into the reaction mixture at a moderate rate while the temperature is maintained at 0\u20135\u00b0. The solution becomes milky after a few minutes owing to the formation of colloidal sulfur. The hydrogen sulfide addition is continued for about 30 minutes, or until the solution is thoroughly saturated.\nThe hydrogen sulfide addition is temporarily suspended, and 100 ml. of pyridine is added rapidly in one portion through the condenser as the solution is stirred vigorously (Note 1). The solution becomes clear, and then 2,5-diamino-3,4-dicyanothiophene begins to precipitate immediately. The hydrogen sulfide addition is resumed and is continued for about 30 minutes while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 0\u20135\u00b0.

If a purer product is desired, the crude material is dissolved in 300 ml. of dimethylformamide, 10 g. of activated alumina (48\u2013100 mesh) is added, and the mixture is filtered. The filtrate is heated to 80\u201390\u00b0 on a steam bath, then 1 l. of boiling water is added immediately (Note 2). The resultant mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the light buff crystals of 2,5-diamino-3,4-dicyanothiophene that separate are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and thoroughly washed with 500 ml. of acetone; weight 26\u201328 g.

The reaction becomes mildly exothermic after a lag of about 5\u201310 minutes, and homogeneous after about 20\u201330 minutes. The temperature is maintained at 40\u00b0 with a cold water bath at the beginning, and with a warm water bath or heating mantle toward the end, of the reaction. After about 3 hours or after analysis has indicated that the peroxide has been consumed (Note 5), the formic acid is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (b.p. 50\u00b0/125 mm.) in a stream of gas (carbon dioxide or nitrogen) to prevent bumping (Note 6). The residue in the flask, which consists of hydroxyformoxystearic acids, is heated for 1 hour at 100\u00b0 with an excess of 3N aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the hot, amber-colored soap solution is cautiously poured into an excess of 3N hydrochloric acid with stirring. The oil which separates is allowed to solidify, and the aqueous layer is discarded. The tan-colored solid is remelted on the steam bath by addition of hot water and stirred well to remove residual salts and water-soluble acids (Note 7).

(274 g., 3.74 moles) of freshly distilled dimethylformamide (Note 1). The flask and its contents are cooled in an ice-salt bath for about 0.5 hour, and 86 ml. (144 g., 0.94 mole) of freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride (Note 2) is subsequently added with stirring to the dimethylformamide over a period of 0.5 hour. The pinkish color of the formylation complex may be observed during this step. The 125-ml. dropping funnel is replaced with a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a solution of 100 g. (0.85 mole) of indole (Note 3) in 100 ml. (95 g., 1.3 moles) of dimethylformamide is added to the yellow solution over a period of 1 hour during which time the temperature should not rise above 10\u00b0. Once the solution is well mixed, the dropping funnel is replaced with a thermometer, and the temperature of the viscous solution is brought to 35\u00b0. The syrup is stirred efficiently at this temperature for 1 hour, or for 15 minutes longer than is necessary for the clear yellow solution to become an opaque, canary-yellow paste (Note 4). At the end of the reaction period, 300 g. of crushed ice is added to the paste (Note 5) with careful stirring, producing a clear, cherry-red aqueous solution.\nThis solution is transferred with 100 ml. of water to a 3-l. three-necked flask containing 200 g. of crushed ice and fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and a separatory funnel containing a solution of 375 g. (9.4 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1 l. of water. The aqueous base is added dropwise with stirring until about one-third of it has been added (Note 6). The remaining two-thirds is added rapidly with efficient stirring (Note 7), and the resulting suspension is heated rapidly to the boiling point and allowed to cool to room temperature, after which it is placed in a refrigerator overnight. The precipitate is collected on a filter and resuspended in 1 l. of water. Most of the inorganic material dissolves, and the product is then collected on a filter, washed with three 300-ml. portions of water and air-dried, yielding about 120 g. (97%) of indole-3-aldehyde, m.p. 196\u2013197\u00b0. The indole-3-aldehyde resulting from this procedure is sufficiently pure for most purposes, but it may be recrystallized from ethanol if desired (Note 8)."

A 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask mounted in a heating mantle is fitted with a 250-ml. dropping funnel, an efficient, sealed, mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser connected to a calcium chloride drying tube. Absolute ethanol (625 ml.) is placed in the flask, the stirrer is started, and 23 g. (1 g. atom) of freshly cut sodium is added in portions. After the sodium has dissolved, 76.1 g. (1 mole) of thiourea is added to the warm, stirred solution in one portion. When the bulk of the thiourea has dissolved, 169 g. (1 mole) of liquefied ethyl ethoxymethylenecyanoacetate is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture over a period of 2 hours (Note 1). This rate of addition keeps the reaction mixture warm. The solution is then stirred and gently refluxed for 6 hours. The sodium salt of the carbethoxypyrimidine may precipitate during the course of the reaction.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to 50\u201360\u00b0, and 1.75 l. of water is added, followed by 65 ml. of acetic acid to make the mixture distinctly acidic. The resulting suspension is stirred and boiled for 5 minutes in order to effect complete decomposition of the sodium salt.\nThe mixture is cooled to 25\u00b0, and the crystalline 2-mercapto-4-amino-5-carbethoxypyrimidine is collected on a 10-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed successively with five 50-ml. portions of water, 50 ml. of acetone, and 50 ml. of ether (Note 2). The carbethoxypyrimidine weighs 152\u2013159 g. (76\u201380%) and melts with decomposition at 259\u2013260\u00b0 (Note 3) after being dried for 5 hours at 110\u00b0 and atmospheric pressure. It is in the form of a cream-colored powder that is sufficiently pure for synthetic purposes. Pure carbethoxypyrimidine can be obtained by recrystallizing the crude product once from 50% acetic acid, using 170 ml. per gram of pyrimidine.\nB. 2-Mercapto-4-hydroxy-5-cyanopyrimidine. The aqueous filtrate from which the crude 2-mercapto-4-amino-5-carbethoxypyrimidine separated is cooled overnight at 0\u00b0, and the cyanopyrimidine that precipitates is collected on a suction filter. The crude product is recrystallized from about 200 ml. of 10% acetic acid with 1 g. of decolorizing charcoal added. Two additional recrystallizations done similarly give the pure cyanopyrimidine as faintly yellow crystals, m.p. 265\u2013272\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 3). The yield is 10\u201318 g. (7\u201312%)."

(0.35 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 45 ml. of methanol. The homogeneous solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 36 hours. After 2 and 5 hours hydrogen peroxide (39.5-g. portions each time) is added (Note 2), (Note 3). The excess hydrogen peroxide is destroyed by stirring the mixture with a small amount of platinum black (Note 4) until the evolution of oxygen ceases. The solution is filtered into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask and concentrated at a bath temperature of 50\u201360\u00b0 (Note 5), a water aspirator being used initially and an oil pump finally, until the amine oxide hydrate solidifies. A Teflon-covered stirring bar is introduced into the flask, which is then connected by a 20-cm. column to a trap (reversed to avoid plugging) cooled in Dry Ice-acetone. The flask is heated in an oil bath to 90\u2013100\u00b0, and the apparatus is evacuated to a pressure of ca. 10 mm. with stirring of the liquefied amine oxide hydrate. When the content of the flask resolidifies, the temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160\u00b0. The amine oxide decomposes completely within about 2 hours at this temperature. Water (100 ml.) is added to the contents of the trap. The olefin layer is removed with a pipette and washed with two 5-ml. portions of water, two 5-ml. portions of ice-cold 10% hydrochloric acid (Note 6), (Note 7), and one 5-ml. portion of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The olefin is cooled in a Dry Ice-acetone bath and filtered through glass wool (Note 8). Distillation over a small piece of sodium through a semimicro column2 yields 26.6\u201329.6 g.

The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure at 60\u201370\u00b0 until no more distillate comes over.

(1.6 moles) of sodium methoxide (Note 4) is placed in the addition flask. The solution is cooled in an ice-salt bath to \u221210\u00b0, then the sodium methoxide is added gradually at a rate such that a temperature below \u22125\u00b0 can be maintained (about 2 hours). The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours (Note 5) and then allowed to come to room temperature overnight. It is cooled again to 0\u00b0 and made slightly acidic by the addition of a solution of 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid in 150 ml. of water. The ether is decanted, and the residual slurry is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed in a separatory funnel with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution to which is added 1-g. portions of sodium bicarbonate until the washings are no longer acidic. After each bicarbonate addition, the mixture is shaken for at least 1 minute before a test for acidity is made. Finally, the ether phase is washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, then dried over 20\u201325 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Distillation of the solvent leaves a nearly quantitative yield of crude glycidic ester (Note 6).",

The filtrate is held at room temperature overnight, and the product collected by filtration. A second crop is obtained by concentration of the mother liquor. The total yield of \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b2-triphenylpropionitrile, m.p. 126.5\u2013127.5\u00b0, is 62.2\u201365.5 g. (95\u201399% yield) (Note 5)."

            "A 200-ml. three-necked flask, equipped with a ball-and-socket sealed mechanical stirrer, a pressure-compensated dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser connected to a mercury bubbler (Note 1), is charged with 0.8 g. (0.033 g. atom) of magnesium turnings, 7.5 g. (0.042 mole) of anthracene, and 35 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). In the dropping funnel there is placed a solution of 5.26 g. (0.03 mole) of o-fluorobromobenzene (Note 3) in 15 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The system is flushed with dry nitrogen for 30 minutes to remove air. The gas flow is then stopped in order to prevent extensive loss of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is heated to and maintained at 60\u00b0 (bath temperature), and one-quarter of the o-fluorobromobenzene solution is added with stirring. The appearance of a yellow color which evidences the start of reaction may not be observed immediately, and another quarter of the solution is then added dropwise over a period of about 45 minutes. When the reaction commences, the remaining solution is added dropwise over a period of 1 hour, after which the mixture is refluxed gently for 90 minutes. The almost homogeneous dark-brown mixture is poured into 100 ml. of methanol, which precipitates much of the unreacted anthracene. Without filtering, the solvents are removed under reduced pressure and the yellow residue is treated with two 50-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, filtered, and vacuum-dried. The dry, yellow residue (10 g.) is dissolved in 45 ml. of hot xylene, then 5.0 g. (0.051 mole) of maleic anhydride is added. The mixture is refluxed for 20 minutes and set aside at room temperature for 2 hours. The maleic anhydride-anthracene adduct (about 9 g.) is removed by filtration, and the brown filtrate is refluxed for 2 hours with 80 ml. of 2N sodium hydroxide solution. When cool, the organic layer is separated, washed three times with 50-ml. portions of water (Note 4), and dried over calcium chloride. The solvent is removed at reduced pressure. The brown residue is dissolved in 70 ml. of carbon tetrachloride and chromatographed on 280 g. of acid-washed alumina, using 1 l. of the same solvent to elute. After evaporation of the solvent, there remains 2.4\u20132.9 g. of a yellow residue which is digested with two 10-ml. portions of pentane (Note 5). The residual crude triptycene is an almost white crystalline solid of melting point 240\u2013248\u00b0. The yield is 2.14 g. (28%) (Note 6). Recrystallization of this material from cyclohexane gives pure white crystals of melting point 255\u2013256\u00b0."

The solution is cooled in ice, and hydrogen sulfide is bubbled through (Note 2) with stirring until the gain of weight is 33\u201334 g. (Note 3). The solution is then poured into a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with a stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer reaching into the liquid. The small flask is rinsed with 25 ml. of ice water and the rinsings added to the rest of the solution. Then 63 g. (0.96 mole) of potassium hydroxide is added and allowed to dissolve. The 3-l. flask is then well flushed with nitrogen and, at a temperature of about 30\u00b0, 76.0 g. (1.0 mole) of carbon disulfide (Note 4) is added at once. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 2 hours (Note 5) while nitrogen is passed through at a rate of about one bubble per second (Note 6) and the temperature is kept at 35\u201338\u00b0 (Note 7).

        "Procedure": [
            "An apparatus resembling that pictured by Schlatter2 is assembled in a good hood. Two 5-l. three-necked flasks are mounted side by side about 10 cm. apart and about 10 cm. above the bench top or stand base. These are referred to as the \"left\" and \"right\" flasks. Each flask is provided with a dry ice condenser in the outermost neck, and each condenser is protected from the air by a soda-lime drying tube. Each flask is provided through the center neck with a motor-driven stirrer. The left stirrer should have a large sweep blade, and the right stirrer should have a small propeller-type blade. The bearing on each stirrer should be capable of holding a small positive pressure (the submitters used ball-joint bearings). The innermost neck of each flask is fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper. One hole in each stopper is for nitrogen supply; a short piece of glass tubing is inserted through each stopper, and these pieces of glass tubing are connected by rubber tubes to a glass \"Y\" tube which in turn is connected by rubber tubing to a tank of dry nitrogen. The rubber tubes between the \"Y\" tube and the flasks are provided with pinch clamps so that the flow of nitrogen can be directed into either flask or into both at once. The other hole in each stopper is for transfer of liquid ammonia from the right flask to the left. A glass tube reaching to the very bottom of the right flask is inserted through the right stopper. A glass tube is inserted through the left stopper so that it projects only a few centimeters into the left flask. These glass tubes are bent so that they point toward each other, and they are connected by a piece of rubber tubing provided with a pinch clamp.\nWith nitrogen flowing and all pinch clamps open, the apparatus is flamed to drive away traces of moisture. The condensers are then provided with dry ice covered by isopropyl alcohol, and the lower part of the right flask is embedded in crushed dry ice. Liquid ammonia (4 l.) is introduced into the right flask through the nitrogen inlet from which the rubber tubing is temporarily disconnected, and 105.8 g. (0.5 mole) of o-acetoacetochloroanilide (Note 1) is placed in the left flask. In order to destroy any water in the ammonia, the right stirrer is started and small pieces of potassium metal are dropped into the ammonia, by briefly lifting the right two-holed stopper, until the blue color persists for 3 minutes. The nitrogen connection to the left flask is clamped shut and, by partially blocking the escape of nitrogen from the right drying tube, about 1 l. of ammonia is forced into the left flask. The connection between the two flasks is now clamped shut. Brief operation of the left stirrer facilitates solution of the o-acetoacetochloroanilide in the ammonia.\nPotassium metal (78 g.; 2 moles) is cut into chunks just small enough to pass through the neck of the right flask; these are stored in a beaker under xylene until needed. About 5 g. of potassium is introduced into the right flask by briefly lifting the two-holed stopper. The right stirrer is started and the potassium is allowed to dissolve. To the resulting deep blue solution is added 0.1 g. of finely crushed ferric nitrate hydrate, a catalyst for the reaction of potassium with ammonia. The solution should begin to boil with evolution of hydrogen. ( Caution: No flames or sparks should be nearby.) The rest of the potassium is added at such a rate as to maintain active gas evolution (Note 2). Stirring is continued in the right flask until all the potassium is consumed, i.e., until the blue color disappears. The right flask now contains a solution of potassium amide in liquid ammonia; 30\u201360 minutes is required for its preparation.\nThe tube between the two flasks is opened by releasing the pinch clamp, and the left stirrer is started. With nitrogen flow to the left flask still blocked, the potassium amide solution is caused to flow into the left flask by partially blocking the right nitrogen exit. The solution in the left flask slowly assumes a chartreuse color. As soon as the right flask is as nearly empty as the apparatus will permit, nitrogen flow is opened to the left flask and closed to the right flask and the connection between the two flasks is clamped shut. The right flask is then disconnected and immediately cleaned by rinsing it carefully with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol to destroy potassium amide and then washing it with water. ( Caution: Potassium amide is inflammable and will ignite on contact with moisture.)\nThe solution in the left flask is stirred for 30 minutes after all the potassium amide has been added. The nitrogen inlet is briefly removed and 120 g. (1.5 moles) of ammonium nitrate is added; this discharges the chartreuse color. ( Caution: Vigorous foaming occurs.) Ethyl ether (500 ml.) is added and the dry ice condenser is replaced by a standard water-cooled condenser. The ammonia is evaporated by allowing the stirred reaction mixture to warm to room temperature; this takes several hours and it is convenient to have it occur overnight.\nWater (1.5 l.) is added and the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer, which contains the potassium salt of 3-acetyloxindole, is separated and is then extracted with ethyl ether three times to remove a purple impurity. The aqueous layer is then made acidic to litmus by addition of hydrochloric acid; this causes precipitation of crude, tan-colored 3-acetyloxindole. The mixture is chilled, and the product is collected by suction filtration and washed well on the filter with water. The yield of crude 3-acetyloxindole, m.p. 204\u2013206\u00b0, is 65\u201368 g. (74\u201378%). It may be purified by recrystallizing it from 1.7 l. of chloroform in the presence of 2 g. of decolorizing carbon. A heated filter funnel must be used in separating the carbon because the product starts to crystallize only slightly below the boiling point of chloroform. The recrystallized 3-acetyloxindole weighs 53\u201359 g. (61\u201367%) and is in the form of white needles, m.p. 204\u2013205.5\u00b0."

            "The apparatus consists of a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a condenser, a dropping funnel, and a stirrer terminating in a stiff, crescent-shaped Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene paddle. The stirrer motor must have good torque (Note 1). The assembled apparatus, which is protected from moisture by means of drying tubes in the condenser and funnel, is preferably predried. About 216\u2013224 g. (1.62\u20131.68 moles) of powdered anhydrous aluminum chloride is added to the apparatus with as little exposure to the moisture of the air as possible (Note 2). While the free-flowing catalyst is stirred (Note 3), 81 g. (0.67 mole) of acetophenone is added from the dropping funnel in a slow stream over a period of 20\u201330 minutes. Considerable heat is evolved, and, if the drops of ketone are not dispersed, darkening or charring occurs. When about one-third of the acetophenone has been added, the mixture becomes a viscous ball-like mass that is difficult to stir. Turning of the stirrer by hand or more rapid addition of ketone is necessary at this point. The addition of ketone, however, should not be so rapid as to produce a temperature above 180\u00b0. Near the end of the addition, the mass becomes molten and can be stirred easily without being either heated or cooled. The molten mass, in which the acetophenone is complexed with aluminum chloride, ranges in color from tan to brown.\nBromine (128 g., 0.80 mole) is added dropwise to the well-stirred mixture over a period of 40 minutes (Note 4). After all the bromine has been added, the molten mixture is stirred at 80\u201385\u00b0 on a steam bath for 1 hour, or until it solidifies if that happens first (Note 5). The complex is added in portions to a well-stirred mixture of 1.3 l. of cracked ice and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 2-l. beaker (Note 6). Part of the cold aqueous layer is added to the reaction flask to decompose whatever part of the reaction mixture remains there, and the resulting mixture is added to the beaker. The dark oil that settles out is extracted from the mixture with four 150-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined, washed consecutively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and transferred to a short-necked distillation flask. The ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and crude 3-bromoacetophenone is stripped from a few grams of heavy dark residue by distillation at reduced pressure. The colorless distillate is carefully fractionated in a column 20 cm. long and 1.5 cm. in diameter that is filled with Carborundum or Heli-Pak filling. The combined middle fractions of constant refractive index are taken as 3-bromoacetophenone; weight, 94\u2013100 g.

            "A modified Parr low-pressure hydrogenation apparatus is used for this preparation.2 The bottle is fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper through which is passed a thermocouple well made of 5-mm. glass tubing and a gooseneck made of 8-mm. heavy-walled glass tubing. The thermocouple well extends into the bottle within about 2 cm. of the bottom. The gooseneck extends 1 cm. into the bottle, and the other end is connected directly to a manifold system with heavy-walled pressure tubing using screw clamps. Also attached to the manifold system through needle valves are a vacuum line, a storage cylinder of chlorotrifluoroethylene, a pressure gauge, and a bleed line.\nThe bottle is charged with 52 g. (1.0 mole) of 95% sodium cyanide, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of acetonitrile, giving a two-phase liquid system. After the bottle is clamped in the metal cage of the shaking apparatus, the bottle is evacuated and filled to a gauge pressure of 10 lb. (0.68 atm.) with chlorotrifluoroethylene. This procedure is repeated twice to purge the system of air. Finally, the bottle is pressured to 40 lb. (2.7 atm.), chlorotrifluoroethylene leaving the valve open to maintain this pressure (Note 1). The thermocouple is fitted into place and shaking is started. The temperature steadily increases, and in 10\u201315 minutes it is about 75\u00b0 and rising more rapidly. It is kept at 75\u201380\u00b0 by cooling and/or slowing the rate of chlorotrifluoroethylene addition. Caution! Careful control of the reaction is mandatory. If the reaction rate cannot be controlled, it is imperative to shut the gas addition valve and to stop the agitation immediately. Cooling is accomplished by packing ice inside the wire cage holding the bottle and/or pouring ice water on the bottle. When cooling is used, it is possible to complete the reaction in 1 hour. When the rate of chlorotrifluoroethylene absorption is negligible and the temperature is about 30\u00b0, pressure is released through the bleed line and the bottle is removed. The gain in weight is 130\u2013135 g. (about 1.1 moles).\nThe product is a dark-colored solution which is poured slowly into sulfuric acid (100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 100 ml. of water) with cooling (Note 2). This operation should be conducted in a hood because some hydrogen cyanide may be evolved from unreacted sodium cyanide. The mixture is then extracted four times with 100-ml. portions of ether (Note 3). The first 100 ml. of ether yields about 260 ml. of organic material, and succeeding portions about 95 ml. each. The extract is dried over about 20 g. of magnesium sulfate and distilled (Note 4). After removal of low-boiling materials, there is obtained 124\u2013128 g. (76\u201379%) of crude 3-chloro-2,2,3-trifluoropropionic acid, b.p. 70\u201385\u00b0/30 mm.; the bulk of this fraction distills at 83\u00b0/30 mm., nD25 1.3708\u20131.3717. This product is of sufficient purity for most purposes (Note 5). About 25\u201330 g. of high-boiling residue remains which is chiefly chlorotrifluoropropionamide (Note 6)."

The resulting solution is decanted into a second 2-l. flask, leaving in the first flask some water and a red-brown solid residue. To the slightly cooled liquor in the second flask is added cautiously 7 g. of powdered activated carbon. The carbon is dispersed by swirling, and the mixture is heated for an additional 5 minutes. The mixture is then filtered through a fluted filter into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. This flask is stoppered and chilled to cause crystallization of the product (Note 7).\nThe product is collected on a suction filter. The yield of air-dried product, as yellow-orange crystals, m.p. 87\u201389\u00b0, is 38\u201342 g. (65\u201371%) (Note 8). A purer, lemon-yellow product, m.p. 88.5\u201390\u00b0, is obtained by an additional recrystallization from 1 l. of petroleum ether (b.p. 90\u2013100\u00b0) with use of carbon; the yield after this second crystallization is 28\u201334 g. (48\u201358%)."

Commercial anhydrous liquid ammonia (500 ml.) is introduced from a cylinder through an inlet tube. To the stirred ammonia is added a small piece of sodium. After the appearance of a blue color, a few crystals of ferric nitrate hydrate (about 0.25 g.) are added, followed by small pieces of freshly cut sodium until 5.2 g. has been added. After all the sodium has been converted to the amide (Note 1), 14.2 g. (0.104 mole) of phenylacetic acid (Note 2) is added and the dark-green suspension is stirred for 15 minutes. To the green suspension is added rapidly 13.2 g. (0.104 mole) of benzyl chloride (Note 3) in 25 ml. of anhydrous ether, and the mixture is then stirred for 1 hour. The mixture is then evaporated to near dryness on a steam bath, 200 ml. of ether added, and evaporation to dryness effected. Another 200 ml. of ether is added, followed by evaporation to dryness. The resulting solid is then dissolved in 300 ml. of water and washed with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The aqueous solution is filtered through a layer of Celite to remove the slight brown coloration, and the filtrate is acidified with hydrochloric acid.

(0.263 mole) of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid (Note 1) is added, and the slurry is stirred with a long glass rod. The beaker is placed firmly in a clamp (Note 2) and set in a cold oil bath (Note 3) in a hood, and 240 g. (1.00 mole) of lead dioxide is stirred in all at once (Note 4). The oil bath is now heated by a flame, and when the bath temperature reaches 200\u00b0 steady manual stirring by means of the glass rod is begun. (Caution! Goggles and a rubber glove should be worn to protect eyes and the stirring hand against spattering.) The temperature is raised, with steady stirring, until the bath reaches 238\u2013240\u00b0, when the flame is moderated to maintain this bath temperature. Several minutes after 240\u00b0 is reached, the mixture boils steadily and the lumpy brown mass turns quickly to a bright-orange melt containing heavy crystals of lead monoxide. The bath is held at 240\u00b0 for another 15 minutes. It is then brought briefly to 250\u00b0, the flame is removed, and the beaker is lifted out of the bath.\nAbout 5 minutes later, the liquid contents of the beaker are poured cautiously into a 2-l. glass beaker, and this is tipped and rotated slowly so as to spread the congealing mass in a thin film on the beaker walls. When the material in the beakers has cooled, a total of 1 l. of water is poured into the beakers and the water is stirred well for at least 1 hour (Note 5). The cold suspension is filtered with suction to separate 200\u2013210 g. of an insoluble mixture of lead monoxide and red lead, which is washed on the filter with six 50-ml. portions of water.\nThe alkaline filtrate and washings are combined and partially neutralized by the addition of 150\u2013175 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Sufficient sodium sulfide solution is added to precipitate all the lead ion present (Note 6). The suspension is brought to a gentle boil to coagulate the lead sulfide, allowed to cool somewhat, and filtered with suction. The filtrate is placed in a 2-l. beaker set in an ice bath and acidified (Caution! in the hood) with about 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid to precipitate crude 2-hydroxyisophthalic acid monohydrate (Note 7). The suspension is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 and filtered to separate the crude acid, which weighs 35\u201349 g. after being dried in a vacuum oven at 110\u00b0/50\u2013150 mm. for 5 hours (Note 8).\nIn order to remove 1\u20133 g. of contaminating 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid, the crude acid is ground in a mortar and refluxed briefly with 100 ml. of chloroform, and the suspension is filtered hot (Note 9). The separated solid is dried in air and added to 1 l. of boiling water. The mixture is boiled gently for 15 minutes and filtered by gravity to remove a small amount of gray sludge. The clear light-orange filtrate rapidly deposits needles of 2-hydroxyisophthalic acid monohydrate. After cooling to 0\u20135\u00b0, the acid is collected and dried at 110\u00b0/50\u2013150 mm. for 20 hours. The anhydrous acid, which ranges in color from pale pink to tan, weighs 22\u201329 g. (46\u201361%) (Note 10) and melts at 243\u2013255\u00b0, depending on the rate of heating and the apparatus used."

Twenty-five grams (0.065 mole) of N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide2 is added to the solution. The resulting suspension is heated to reflux temperature with stirring. At this point the solid is in solution. Within 5 minutes oil starts to separate from the solution and trimethylamine starts to come off. At the end of 3.5 hours, at which time the evolution of the amine has virtually ceased, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The oil generally crystallizes during the cooling. The mixture is stirred with 150 ml. of ether until the oil or solid is all dissolved in the ether. The ether layer is separated in a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is extracted with two additional 150-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with water and dried over sodium sulfate.\nThe oil that remains when the solvent is removed from the extract crystallizes when cooled to room temperature.

            "A. Chloropyruvic acid. In a 1-l. four-necked flask (Note 1) fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, thermometer, and reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube is placed 249 g. (2.83 moles) of pyruvic acid (Note 2). The stirrer is started and 394 g. (2.92 moles) of sulfuryl chloride (Note 3) is added dropwise over a period of 2 hours. During the addition the temperature is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0 by cooling with a water bath.\nThe mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 60 hours (Note 4), during which time the calcium chloride tube may become spent and need replacement. The viscous, light-yellow liquid product is transferred to a large crystallizing dish and dried in a vacuum desiccator over soda-lime for about 24 hours (Note 5).\nThe yield of light-yellow chloropyruvic acid is 333\u2013340 g. (96\u201398%) (Note 6).",
            "B. 3-Hydroxycinchoninic acid. A 3-l., four-necked flask (Note 1) is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, gas inlet tube, gas outlet consisting of a 1-mm. capillary (Note 7), and thermometer. The flask is charged with a freshly prepared solution containing 448 g. (8 moles) of reagent grade (85% minimum assay) potassium hydroxide and 900 ml. of water. The solution (hot from dissolution of potassium hydroxide) is stirred and 147 g. (1 mole) of isatin (Note 8) is introduced. The solid quickly dissolves to give an orange-yellow solution.\nAfter replacement of the gas outlet the flask is flushed with nitrogen, and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained during the remaining operations (Note 9). The temperature is maintained at 20\u201325\u00b0 by cooling when necessary. The solution is stirred vigorously as 168.5 g. (1.375 moles) of chloropyruvic acid (part A) is added gradually over a period of 2 hours (Note 10). After stirring has been continued for an additional hour, the introduction of nitrogen and the stirring are terminated, the flask is stoppered, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 days.\nAt the end of the standing period the reaction mixture is cooled with stirring and maintained at 15\u201318\u00b0. A solution containing 34 g. of sodium bisulfite in 60 ml. of water (Note 11) is added, and the mixture is made acid to Congo red paper by the dropwise addition of reagent grade concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 12) (approximately 480 ml.). The yellow product that precipitates is separated by suction filtration on a large (at least 15-cm.) B\u00fcchner (or sintered-glass) funnel and washed with water saturated with sulfur dioxide. Drainage of the filter cake, whose consistency is that of putty, is slow. Pressing with a large cork or use of a rubber dam is helpful. The pressed solid is suspended in 1.3 l. of water previously saturated with sulfur dioxide, and the mixture is mechanically stirred for 30 minutes.\nAfter the product has been collected as before, the filter cake is pressed well, suspended in 800 ml. of water, and dissolved by stirring and adding the minimum quantity of reagent grade concentrated aqueous ammonia (approximately 60 ml.). A small amount of insoluble material is removed by filtration. A saturated solution of 8 g. of sodium bisulfite is added to the filtrate. The orange-yellow solution is stirred mechanically and made acid to Congo red paper by the dropwise addition of reagent grade concentrated hydrochloric acid (approximately 80 ml.).\nThe product is again collected by filtration, washed with water, resuspended in 225 ml. of water, collected, and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is thoroughly dispersed in 160 ml. of absolute alcohol, then filtered, air-dried, and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid. The bright-yellow solid is pulverized and redried. The yield is 115\u2013135 g. (60\u201371%). When this product is inserted in a bath preheated to 210\u00b0 and the temperature is increased at a rate of 1\u00b0 per 10 seconds, decomposition with evolution of gas occurs at 219\u2013220\u00b0 (cor.) (Note 13).",
            "C. 3-Hydroxyquinoline. A 1-l. beaker is fitted with a thermometer and mechanical stirrer and clamped firmly on an efficient electric heater (Note 14). Diethyl succinate (400 ml.) (Note 15) is placed in the beaker and heated to boiling (215\u2013220\u00b0) with stirring. 3-Hydroxycinchoninic acid (part B) (94.6 g., 0.5 mole) is added in portions to the boiling solution by means of a metal spoon or Scoopula. Care is taken to prevent too vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide. The addition requires 2\u20133 minutes, during which time a temperature drop is noted unless good heating is maintained.\nStirring and boiling are continued until complete solution is effected. This requires about 6 minutes (Note 16). The stirrer is withdrawn and the beaker is removed from the hot plate for a few minutes. Finally, the solution is stirred and cooled first in a warm water bath and then in an ice bath. After 30 minutes the gray-brown solid is collected by suction filtration and washed with hexane. The product is suspended in 250 ml. of hexane, filtered, and washed with hexane. After drying, the crude gray-colored 3-hydroxyquinoline weighs 57\u201363 g. (79\u201387%), m.p. 175\u2013191\u00b0 (cor.).\nThe crude product is suspended in 190 ml. of water and dissolved by the addition of the minimum quantity (31\u201335 ml.) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution is filtered in order to remove a small amount of insoluble material. The filtrate is treated with decolorizing carbon (about 3.5 g.), allowed to stand for 30 minutes, and filtered. The filtrate from the charcoal is stirred and treated dropwise with concentrated aqueous ammonia (25\u201329 ml.) until precipitation is complete. The precipitate is removed by filtration, washed with water (two 30-ml. portions), and dried. The yield at this stage is 48\u201355 g. of material melting at 185\u2013195\u00b0 (cor.).\nThe reprecipitated product is pulverized, dissolved in a boiling mixture of methanol (about 420 ml.) and water (about 360 ml.), and treated with decolorizing charcoal for about 10 minutes. The boiling mixture is filtered through a fluted filter paper placed on a large Pyrex funnel resting on a wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask containing a little boiling solvent of the same composition. The filtrate is concentrated to incipient precipitation (about 600 ml. volume) and allowed to cool. After drying, the yield of tan-colored crystalline 3-hydroxyquinoline is 44\u201347 g.

(0.25 mole) of freshly distilled methyl disulfide (Note 1) and 51.05 g. (0.5 mole) of acetic anhydride (Note 2). The reaction flask is then partially immersed in a bath of acetone cooled by dry ice until the internal temperature has reached 0\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0. The temperature is maintained within these limits throughout the reaction (Note 3). The reaction is best carried out in a well-ventilated hood.\nChlorine is passed into the well-stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature is controlled between 0\u00b0 and \u221210\u00b0. The progress of the reaction can be followed by color changes. At first the mixture turns yellow, then reddish as methanesulfenyl chloride (CH3SCl) accumulates but gradually the color fades, and the mixture may become colorless. The addition of chlorine is terminated when a faint greenish-yellow color indicates an excess of chlorine (Note 4).\nThe reaction mixture is then transferred (Note 5) with a few fresh chips of porous plate to a distilling flask having a thermometer well, and the flask is fitted to a 12- to 18-in. Vigreux column and vacuum distillation apparatus. The fraction collector of the latter is connected through a trap cooled in an acetone-dry ice bath and a safety trap to a water pump. The cold trap must have sufficient capacity to contain, without backing up, all the acetyl chloride formed in the reaction.\nThe pressure is gradually decreased without heating the flask. The excess chlorine rapidly escapes and at 15 mm. the acetyl chloride boils smoothly below 0\u00b0. No heat is applied until most of the acetyl chloride has been removed (Note 6). Heat is then gradually increased until at 47\u201348\u00b0 (15 mm.) the methanesulfinyl chloride distills as a nearly colorless liquid with nD25 1.500 (lit.2 nD25 1.5038). Its nmr spectrum shows a single peak at \u03b4 3.33 ppm with no sign of a singlet at \u03b4 3.64 ppm, the frequency characteristic of methanesulfonyl chloride. The yield is 41\u201342 g.

            "In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with an efficient sealed stirrer, a gas inlet tube extending within 1 in. of the reaction mixture but not below its surface, and a gas outlet tube leading through a trap cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath to a hydrogen chloride absorption system (Note 8), are placed 94.2 g. (1 mole) of methyl disulfide (Note 9) and 120 g. (2 moles) of glacial acetic acid. The reaction flask is then surrounded by a bath of acetone cooled by dry ice until the internal temperature has reached 0\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0. The temperature is maintained within these limits throughout the reaction (Note 10) except that, toward the end, the temperature should be kept at \u221210\u00b0 to \u221215\u00b0 to minimize the escape of hydrogen chloride which might carry with it unreacted chlorine. The entire reaction is best carried out in a well-ventilated hood.\nThree moles of chlorine (212.7 g.) is condensed in a tared flask cooled by a dry ice-acetone bath (Note 11). This flask is then connected to the gas inlet tube of the chlorination apparatus, and the cooling bath surrounding the chlorine container is removed. After about 2 hours the chlorine has all been absorbed by the reaction mixture (Note 12).\nWhen the last of the chlorine has been added, the cooling bath is removed and, while vigorous stirring is continued (Note 13), the reaction mixture is allowed slowly to warm to room temperature. During this period there is a vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride. The flask is finally warmed to 35\u00b0 to facilitate the escape of more hydrogen chloride.\nThe reaction mixture and contents of the cold trap and then transferred (Note 14) to a 500-ml. distilling flask attached through a short fractionating column to a water-cooled condenser which is connected in series to a receiver, a trap cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath, and a hydrogen chloride absorption trap which may later be attached to a water pump. The mixture is then distilled until the pot temperature reaches 100\u00b0 and practically all of the acetyl chloride has been driven over.\nThe residue, consisting chiefly of methanesulfinyl chloride, is then cooled immediately to 20\u00b0 or lower and transferred to a 250-ml. flask and distilled through the same equipment under reduced pressure to remove the remaining acetyl chloride and other lower-boiling impurities. As the pot temperature begins to rise, a yellow intermediate fraction is collected very slowly until the distillate and pot temperatures are within 3\u00b0 of each other (Note 15). At this point the distillation is temporarily discontinued while the accumulated acetyl chloride (Note 16) is removed from the cold trap and the receiver for the main product is attached. On resuming distillation the main product should come over within a 5\u00b0 boiling range, and the distillation and pot temperature should remain within 2\u00b0 of each other until the major part of the product has distilled. The yield is 161\u2013177 g. (82\u201392%) of straw-colored or yellow product boiling at 55\u201359\u00b0 (40 mm.) and having nD25 1.500\u20131.501 (Note 7)."

The pH of the resultant deep-brown solution is adjusted to a value of 7 (Note 2) with 6N hydrochloric acid and 3N potassium hydroxide. It is treated with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtered. This operation is repeated. The filtrate is concentrated in a 1.5-l. beaker on a steam bath to about 180 ml. The concentrate is cooled to room temperature, 800 ml. of methanol is added with vigorous stirring by hand, and the mixture is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0. The precipitated dipotassium naphthalate is separated by filtration, washed with 150 ml. of methanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 150\u00b0/150 mm.

The mixture is placed in a 0.5-l. autoclave (Note 3) and (Note 4) that can be rocked, rolled, or shaken. The autoclave is evacuated, for oxygen lowers the yield of the product. The autoclave is then filled with carbon dioxide to a pressure of about 30 atm. The agitated autoclave is heated to an internal temperature of 400\u2013430\u00b0 in the course of 1\u20132 hours and is maintained at this temperature for 1.5 hours. The pressure rises to about 90 atm. in the course of the heating (Note 4).\nThe autoclave is cooled to room temperature, and the carbon dioxide is bled off. The solid reaction product is taken from the autoclave, pulverized, and dissolved in 1 l. of water at 50\u201360\u00b0. Ten grams of decolorizing carbon is added, and the mixture is stirred well and filtered to remove cadmium salts and carbon.

(1 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 570 ml. of water (Note 3). The reaction flask is swept out with nitrogen and cooled to 10\u00b0 by means of an ice bath. Stirring is commenced and the two solutions are added simultaneously and equivalently over a period of 20 minutes. The temperature is held below 20\u00b0.\nWhen the addition is completed, 50 ml. (1 mole) of 52% sodium hydroxide is added with stirring and cooling, and then 450 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate (not all of the salt dissolves). The cold solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The organic layer is neutralized with 52% sodium hydroxide; approximately 20 ml. is required to bring the pH to 7. The aqueous layer, including the precipitated ferric hydroxide, is added to the aqueous portion of the reaction mixture and the whole is extracted with 400 ml. of t-butyl alcohol. This extract is similarly treated with 52% sodium hydroxide (about 5 ml. is required). The resulting aqueous layer is combined with the main aqueous fraction, which is again extracted with 400 ml. of t-butyl alcohol. This whole process is again repeated so that the organic phases comprise the three extracts and the phase which separated initially from the reaction mixture.\nThe four organic fractions are combined and distilled under reduced pressure. The distillation is continued until the temperature of the flask is about 70\u00b0/5 mm. in order to remove most of the t-butyl alcohol. The still residue is then extracted with 2 l. of ether and the extract is treated with decolorizing carbon and diatomaceous earth.

After standing overnight, the heavy dark oil is separated, washed successively with 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, water, 5% aqueous sodium bisulfite and water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate.\nDistillation under reduced pressure gives o-bromoiodobenzene as a nearly colorless liquid, b.p. 120\u2013121\u00b0 at 15 mm. Yield 65\u201375 g. (72\u201383%).\nA 1-l. flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, dropping funnel, and a sealed mechanical stirrer. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the flask during the entire reaction period.\nIn the flask is placed 150 ml. of anhydrous ether, and 5.7 g. (4.1 atomic equivalents) of lithium foil is then added (Note 2). A solution of 56.6 g. (0.2 mole) of o-bromoiodobenzene in 300 ml. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise (Note 3). When a vigorous reaction commences, the stirrer is started and the flask is cooled in ice water to maintain the temperature at about 10\u00b0. The reflux condenser is replaced by a thermometer, and the remainder of the o-bromoiodobenzene solution is added at a rate such that the temperature in the flask remains at about 10\u00b0 (about 1.5 hours). When this addition is complete, 200 ml. of dry benzene is added; the mixture is stirred at 10\u00b0 for 1 hour and finally at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is then poured through a glass-wool filter on 200 g. of ice.\nThe organic layer is separated, evaporated on a steam bath, and the dark semicrystalline residue is distilled with steam to remove biphenyl. The contents of the steam-distillation flask are then extracted with ether (Note 4), and the ethereal layer is separated, dried over magnesium sulfate, and percolated through a short column of chromatographic alumina (Note 5) and (Note 6). Evaporation of the ethereal solution gives crude triphenylene which is sublimed at 175\u2013180\u00b0 and 0.1 mm. pressure. After rejection of an initial sublimate of impure biphenyl, the sublimed material forms nearly colorless crystals, m.p. 186\u2013194\u00b0 (Note 7). Yield 8\u20139 g. (53\u201359%). It may be further purified by recrystallization from a mixture of methylene chloride and pentane yielding colorless crystals, m.p. 199\u00b0 (Note 8)."
