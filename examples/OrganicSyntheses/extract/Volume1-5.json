            "A given primary alcohol is treated with 25 per cent excess of aqueous (48 per cent) hydrobromic acid (Note 1) together with sulfuric acid (Note 2). The mixture is refluxed (Note 3) in order to convert the alcohol as completely as possible into the corresponding bromide, and the latter is then removed from the reaction mixture by distillation. The water-insoluble layer is separated; washed successively with water, cold concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 4), and a sodium carbonate solution; separated; dried with calcium chloride (Note 5); and distilled. Slight variations from this procedure depend upon the physical and chemical properties of the alcohol used, or of the bromide formed in the reaction. For example, in the preparations of ethyl and allyl bromides, the reaction mixture is not refluxed because of the volatility of the former compound, and because of the chemical reactivity of the latter; in the preparation of iso-amyl bromide, too large a proportion of sulfuric acid may produce appreciable decomposition, whereas halides of high molecular weight, because of their low volatility, are separated from the reaction mixture mechanically, instead of by distillation.\nThe use of a modified sodium bromide-sulfuric acid method (Note 6) for the preparation of alkyl bromides is described in connection with the preparation of n-butyl bromide. This method has been used also for the preparations of iso-amyl and trimethylene bromides, but, in general, the yields were found to be somewhat lower than those obtained with the hydrobromic-sulfuric acid method.",
            "Preparation of Hydrobromic Acid.\u2014Hydrobromic acid may be prepared conveniently by the interaction of bromine and sulfur dioxide in the presence of water1 (Note 7).\nIn a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1200 g. (377 cc., 7.5 moles) of bromine, 500 cc. of water, and 1500 g. of crushed ice. A fairly rapid stream of sulfur dioxide is allowed to pass from a pressure tank into the flask, the outlet of the gas-tube being placed below the surface of the bromine layer. The flow of sulfur dioxide is adjusted at such a rate that the gas is completely absorbed. It is advisable to agitate the mixture occasionally during the first stage of the reduction (Note 8). About two hours will serve for the completion of the reduction, at which time the mixture will assume a yellow color (Note 9) which is not removed by further addition of sulfur dioxide, an excess of which is to be avoided (Note 10). To prevent loss by gaseous hydrogen bromide, it is advisable to cool the mixture during the progress of the reduction.\nWhen the reduction is completed, the flask is connected with a condenser and the mixture subjected to distillation. The boiling point of constant boiling hydrobromic acid is 125\u2013126\u00b0 /760 mm., but it must be remembered that, in distilling the product from the sulfuric acid mixture, the thermometer reading should not be relied upon as an index to the composition of the distillate. Towards the end of the distillation the thermometer may rise to 130\u00b0 and above, when water with only traces of acid distils from the sulfuric acid residue. Upon redistillation of the product the thermometer reading may be relied upon. For many uses a product free from traces of sulfuric acid is not required and one distillation is sufficient. In such cases the progress of the distillation is followed by determinations of the specific gravity of the distillate.\nAccording to the above procedure, 20 kg. of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid (92 per cent of the theoretical amount) may be prepared from 10.3 kg. of bromine. The actual time required by one person for the preparation of this quantity is twenty-three hours.\nFor the preparation of alkyl bromides on a relatively large scale the hydrobromic acid need not be distilled but may be used directly for the subsequent preparation. The fact that 0.5 mole of sulfuric acid is present for each mole of hydrobromic acid is not a disadvantage, since the presence of sulfuric acid is desired, and consequently a correspondingly smaller quantity need be added.",

(150.5 cc., 3 moles) of bromine in the presence of 510 g. of ice water or a mixture is made of 1 kg. (5.9 moles) of aqueous 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 300 g. (162 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid. To this is added 385 cc. of aqueous allyl alcohol (p. 42), which, according to bromine titration, contains 233 g. (4 moles) of pure allyl alcohol. The 3-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer (Note 11), separatory funnel, and an efficient condenser set for downward distillation. Stirring is started, and 300 g. (162 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added gradually through the separatory funnel to the warm solution. The allyl bromide distils over completely in about one-half to one hour. The crude allyl bromide is washed with dilute sodium carbonate solution, dried over calcium chloride, and then distilled. The yield of product boiling at 69\u201372\u00b0 from a number of experiments varies from 445\u2013465 g. (92\u201396 per cent of the theoretical amount). A small high-boiling fraction is also obtained and examination has shown this to consist of propylene bromide.",

(314 cc., 6.25 moles) of bromine. This is equivalent to a mixture of 2.1 kg. (12.5 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 600 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid. There are then added, in the order mentioned, 880 g. (1086 cc., 10 moles) of iso-amyl alcohol (b.p. 130\u2013132\u00b0) and 100 g. (54.5 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid. The clear homogeneous solution is refluxed gently during a period of five to six hours. Even during the early stages of the heating, the separation of iso-amyl bromide is observed, and the reaction appears to be complete after about one hour. The product is isolated as in the preparation of n-butyl bromide below.\nA yield of 1435 g. of crude product is obtained. After purification with concentrated sulfuric acid the product weighs 1410 g. (93 per cent of the theoretical amount). Upon fractionation, however, it is found that appreciable amounts of a high-boiling product are present, and therefore the yield of fractionated material boiling over the range 116\u2013120\u00b0 varies in different experiments from 1330 to 1360 g. (88\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount).",

(376 cc., 7.5 moles) of bromine. The flask is cooled in an ice-water bath and sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture until the red color due to free bromine has just disappeared (p. 26). This mixture is equivalent to 2500 g. (14.8 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid to which 750 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid has been added.\nTo the sulfuric-hydrobromic acid mixture is added 888 g. (1096 cc., 12 moles) of n-butyl alcohol. Following this, 600 g. (324 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added in several portions, with shaking. The flask is then attached to a reflux condenser and the mixture is refluxed during a period of five to six hours, during which time the formation of butyl bromide is carried practically to completion. The flask is now fitted with a condenser set downward and the product removed from the reaction mixture by direct distillation (about one hour). The water-insoluble layer is separated, washed first with water, then with 200 g. (109 cc.) of cold concentrated sulfuric acid, and finally with a sodium carbonate solution (50 g. of sodium carbonate in 500 cc. of water). The product is separated as completely as possible from the aqueous layer, dried during several hours with a small quantity (15\u201325 g.) of calcium chloride, and distilled. The yield of product boiling between 101\u2013104\u00b0 is 1560 g. (95 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nSodium Bromide Method.\u2014In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 1350 cc. of water, and then with stirring 1545 g. (15 moles) of finely powdered sodium bromide is added. It is advisable to add the salt to the water in this manner in place of the reverse procedure, in order to avoid caking of the sodium bromide. First, 888 g. (12 moles) of n-butyl alcohol and then gradually 2 kg. (1087 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid are added. The last half of the acid is added through a dropping funnel after the flask has been connected with a reflux condenser. The mixture is shaken occasionally during the addition of the sulfuric acid because of a tendency to separate into layers, and is finally refluxed during a period of two hours. The condenser is then set downward and the butyl bromide removed by distillation. The product is purified as in the preceding experiment for the preparation of n-butyl bromide by the hydrobromic-sulfuric acid method. The yield of n-butyl bromide boiling between 101\u2013104\u00b0 is 1480 g. (90 per cent of the theoretical amount).",

(0.42 mole) of hydrobromic acid (48 per cent) (p. 26) and 22 g. (12 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid. To this mixture is added 40 g. (0.22 mole) of lauryl alcohol (b.p. 188\u2013192\u00b0 /110 mm.) (Org. Syn. 10, 62), and the mixture is then refluxed for five to six hours. The bromide is isolated as described in the preparation of n-octyl bromide (p. 30). The product is distilled under reduced pressure and is collected from 175\u2013180\u00b0 /45 mm. The yield is 49 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 12).",
            "DOI: 10.15227/orgsyn.001.0003\n(E) ETHYL BROMIDE, CH3CH2Br\n[Ethane, bromo-]\nIn the preparation of hydrobromic acid for the manufacture of ethyl bromide, particular care must be taken to avoid the presence of any excess of sulfur dioxide gas. The evolution of gas during the distillation of the ethyl bromide will invariably result in a large loss of this volatile product (b.p. 38\u201339\u00b0).\nA hydrobromic acid solution is prepared (p. 26) in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask by the reduction of 1 kg. (314 cc., 6.25 moles) of bromine in the presence of 1.1 kg. of cracked ice. A mixture of 2075 g. (12.3 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 600 g. (324 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid may be used in place of the above reduction mixture. After the addition of 500 g. (622 cc., 10 moles) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, the flask is attached to a long condenser set ready for distillation, and 1 kg. (544 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly added through a separatory funnel. Because of the volatility of ethyl bromide, the mixture is not heated under a reflux condenser, but is subjected instead to slow distillation. The end of the condenser is provided with an adapter tube, and the distillate is collected in a flask containing ice water. The crude ethyl bromide, weighing 1055 g., is purified as directed under the n-butyl bromide experiment (p. 28). The washing with concentrated sulfuric acid is almost superfluous unless a product of special purity is desired; for instance, in the present experiment a washing with 300 g. of concentrated acid results in a decrease in weight of only 10 g.\nThe ethyl bromide is distilled from a water bath and boils at 38.5\u201339.5\u00b0 provided that chips of porous plate are added to prevent superheating. Final yields vary from 980 to 1035 g. (90\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount) according to the precautions taken to prevent losses due to evaporation.",

The mixture is boiled under reflux for five to six hours. The solution is diluted with water and the bromide layer is separated, washed once with a little cold concentrated sulfuric acid, then with water and finally with dilute sodium carbonate solution, after the procedure described for n-butyl bromide. The crude yield is 102 g.; this is dried over a little calcium chloride and distilled. The product is collected at 196\u2013200\u00b0 (91\u201393\u00b0 /22 mm.) and amounts to 96 g.

(377 cc., 7.5 moles) of bromine and 1300 g. of crushed ice, and the bromine is reduced with sulfur dioxide to hydrobromic acid (p. 26). In place of the above reduction mixture, there may be used a mixture of 2.5 kg. (14.8 moles) of aqueous 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 750 g. (408 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid.\nFirst, 456 g. (433 cc., 6 moles) of trimethylene glycol (b.p. 210\u2013215\u00b0) is added, and then 1200 g. (652 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, the sulfuric acid being added slowly. The mixture is refluxed (Note 13) during a period of five to six hours and is then subjected to distillation until no water-insoluble product appears in the distillate (about one hour).\nThe trimethylene bromide is purified (Note 14) in accordance with the method used for n-butyl bromide (p. 28). A yield of 1065\u20131142 g. boiling at 162\u2013165\u00b0 (88\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount) is obtained.\nSodium Bromide Method.\u2014The yields of trimethylene bromide by the sodium bromide method as described for n-butyl bromide (p. 29) are slightly lower than those given above.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 2 kg. (1587 cc., 21.7 moles) of glycerol and 700 g. (585 cc., 12.9 moles) of technical 85 per cent formic acid (Note 1). The flask is connected with a condenser set for downward distillation and the temperature within the reaction mixture is indicated by a thermometer, the bulb of which is immersed in the liquid. It is advisable to use as a receiver a distilling flask attached tightly to the lower end of the condenser. A tube is then run from the side arm of the distilling flask to a bottle of strong caustic soda to dissolve and decompose any acrolein which may be formed; a few pieces of clay plate are added to the distillation flask containing the reactants in order to prevent bumping, and it is then heated rapidly over a good ring burner (Note 2). The first runnings should come over within fifteen minutes and a temperature of 195\u00b0 should be reached in thirty to forty-five minutes. Slow heating causes charring and formation of much acrolein, and thus gives a very low yield of allyl alcohol. The distillate collected up to the point where the thermometer registers 195\u00b0 is saved separately (Note 3). Heating is continued until the temperature reaches 260\u00b0, the main reaction taking place between 225\u00b0 and 235\u00b0. At 260\u00b0, when the heating should be stopped, a white smoke appears and decomposition apparently begins. The distillate (about 750 cc.) coming over between the thermometer readings between 195\u00b0 and 260\u00b0 is saved. For this operation about four hours are required.\nThe contents of the flask are now allowed to cool to a temperature between 100\u00b0 and 125\u00b0, and 500 g. (9.2 moles) more of the technical 85 per cent formic acid is added. The distillation is then repeated in exactly the same manner as described above and 500 cc. of distillate is collected between the temperatures from 195\u2013260\u00b0. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool again and a third portion of 500 g. of formic acid is added. This distillation yields not more than 350 cc. of the desired fraction, indicating that the glycerol is used up and that further addition of formic acid is unnecessary; moreover, the residue left behind is now small, amounting only to 100\u2013200 cc. The three distillations require from one to one and one-half days.\nThe 195\u2013260\u00b0 fractions of the distillates are treated with potassium carbonate to salt out the allyl alcohol and to neutralize the little formic acid present. This allyl alcohol is then distilled and the fraction boiling up to about 103\u00b0 is collected, or if a column is used, up to 98\u00b0. In this way, 845 g. of an allyl alcohol is obtained, which by bromine titration shows a purity of about 68\u201370 per cent (Note 4). This is equivalent to 570\u2013590 g. of pure allyl alcohol (45\u201347 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5).\nThe alcohol may be made practically anhydrous by refluxing with successive portions of fused potassium carbonate until no further action is observed. The carbonate will remain finely divided and will not become sticky when water is absent. A considerable amount of allyl alcohol is lost mechanically during the drying in this way, so that the potassium carbonate which is used here should be employed for the salting out of fresh portions of allyl alcohol in the first part of subsequent preparations. The allyl alcohol thus produced is dry enough for all practical purposes (98\u201399 per cent), and it is unnecessary to dry with lime or barium oxide as advised in the literature in order to remove all the water. The allyl alcohol obtained by this process boils at 94\u201397\u00b0.\nThe checkers have used the following method with success for obtaining a completely anhydrous product. The allyl alcohol obtained after one salting out with potassium carbonate is distilled as indicated above to give a product of about 70 per cent purity and then mixed with one-quarter of its volume of carbon tetrachloride (Note 6). The mixture is then slowly distilled from a round-bottomed flask fitted with a fractionating column at least 80 cm. long, collecting the low-boiling mixture of carbon tetrachloride, water, and allyl alcohol, drying it with potassium carbonate, and returning it to the flask (Note 7). This process is repeated several times, until only very little water passes over. The mixture is then completely distilled, taking the following cuts: Up to 80\u00b0, 80\u201390\u00b0, 90\u201395\u00b0, 95.5\u201397\u00b0, the last being alcohol which titrates 100 per cent pure. The lower fractions are dried separately and refractionated, thus giving an additional portion boiling at 95.5\u201397\u00b0."

            "(A) Phosphorus Pentachloride Method.\u2014In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask is placed a mixture of 250 g. (1.2 moles) of finely divided phosphorus pentachloride and 450 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium benzenesulfonate which has previously been dried for three hours at 140\u00b0. The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 170\u2013180\u00b0 (Note 1) for fifteen hours (Note 2). It is advisable to have a reflux condenser attached to the flask, although very little active refluxing takes place. Every four hours during the heating period, the flask should be removed from the oil bath, cooled for fifteen minutes, stoppered and shaken thoroughly until the mass becomes pasty (sometimes ten to fifteen minutes are required to accomplish this). At the end of the heating period, the mixture is cooled and 1 l. of water with 1 kg. of cracked ice are added. Benzenesulfonyl chloride sinks to the bottom, is separated, washed once with water, filtered if necessary, and distilled under reduced pressure for purification. The forerun, consisting of a little chlorobenzene, water, and a little benzenesulfonyl chloride, is discarded and the fraction boiling between 145\u2013150\u00b0 /45 mm. is collected. This weighs 330\u2013360 g. (75\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3).\nThe yields in this procedure are likely to vary widely on account of the variability in the different samples of sodium benzenesulfonate. With certain samples a solid impurity is left as a residue from the distillation of the crude benzenesulfonyl chloride.\n(B) Phosphorus Oxychloride Method.\u2014Benzenesulfonyl chloride may be prepared by the same procedure described above from a mixture of 270 g. (1.5 moles) of sodium benzenesulfonate and 180 g. (1.17 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride. It is advisable to observe the same precaution of shaking every few hours. The yield of product boiling at 145\u2013150\u00b0 /45 mm. is 195\u2013230 g. (74\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3).",
            "In a 5-l. flask, fitted with stirrer, separatory funnel, exit tube, and thermometer, is placed 3.5 kg. (2 l., 30 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid (Note 1), and to it is slowly added, with continuous stirring, 780 g. (888 cc., 10 moles) of benzene (Note 2), keeping the temperature between 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 by means of cold water. The hydrogen chloride which is evolved is led to a hood or absorbed in water (Fig. 7, p. 97). The addition requires two to three hours; when this is complete, the mixture is stirred for one hour, and poured upon 6\u20137 kg. of crushed ice (Note 3). One liter of carbon tetrachloride is then added, the oil is separated as soon as possible (Note 4), and the watery layer is shaken with 500 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined extracts are washed with dilute sodium carbonate, and the bulk of the carbon tetrachloride is distilled under atmospheric pressure (Note 5); the pressure is then reduced (Note 6) and the benzenesulfonyl chloride collected at 113\u2013115\u00b0 /10 mm. (118\u2013120\u00b0 /15 mm.). The yield is 1320\u20131360 g. (75\u201377 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless liquid which on cooling sets to a crystalline solid melting at 13\u201314\u00b0.\nA small amount (50\u2013100 g.) of higher-boiling material remains in the flask. This is mainly diphenyl sulfone, which may be isolated by distillation under reduced pressure (b.p. 225\u00b0 /10 mm.) and recrystallization from methyl alcohol. It forms colorless crystals which melt at 128\u00b0."

The moist benzoin (450\u2013460 g.) is added in portions to this solution and the mixture is stirred, preferably with a mechanical stirrer, while heated on the steam bath (Note 1). As heating continues the mixture thickens and more water is added from time to time. A total of 750\u2013800 cc. is needed.

The flask is well cooled (below + 5\u00b0) in a salt and ice mixture (Note 2), stirring is started, and the bromine solution is allowed to run in. The addition requires about two hours. When this is completed, the flask is disconnected, and a condenser set for downward distillation is attached to it. By having a distilling flask as a receiver attached tightly to the lower end of the condenser, the dissolved hydrogen bromide which is evolved at the beginning of the heating may be led into the water used for collecting the first hydrogen bromide.\nThe carbon disulfide is distilled off; it amounts to about 1200 cc. (Note 3). The residual liquid is then slowly distilled under reduced pressure with a good fractionating column (Note 4) in a 1.5- or 2-l. Claisen flask which must be slightly modified (Fig. 9, p. 130) so that the p-bromophenol after coming in contact with cork or rubber will not be carried into the condenser (Note 5); if it does, it becomes pinkish. The yield is 1475\u20131550 g. (80\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount) of p-bromophenol boiling at 145\u2013150\u00b0 /25\u201330 mm. In addition, there is obtained 250\u2013350 g. of lower-boiling material consisting of a mixture of o-bromophenol and p-bromophenol from which it is very difficult to extract either constituent in pure form, and a small quantity of high-boiling material consisting chiefly of 2,4-dibromophenol. The p-bromophenol on cooling solidifies to a solid white mass containing practically no oil. By centrifuging the product, perfectly dry white crystals are obtained, m.p. 63\u00b0. There is also produced in this preparation about 1.5\u20131.6 l. of hydrobromic acid with a specific gravity of about 1.3 (Note 6)."

            "A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a Soxhlet extractor (Note 1) which in turn is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser. In the flask are placed 1190 g. (1500 cc., 20.5 moles) of commercial acetone (Note 2) and a few pieces of porous plate to produce even boiling. Two of the usual paper thimbles are placed in the extractor, one above the other. The lower one is filled nearly full of barium hydroxide; the top one is filled about three-quarters full of the same substance (Note 3), and the remainder of the space is filled with glass wool.\nThe flask is heated on a steam bath or in an oil bath. The heat is so regulated that the acetone refluxes back into the extractor rather rapidly. As the reaction proceeds the boiling point of the mixture rises and more steam has to be turned on or the temperature of the oil bath has to be raised. The flask should finally be lowered as far as possible into the cone of the steam bath. The reaction is complete when the liquid no longer boils when heated as hot as possible on the steam bath. This usually requires ninety-five to one hundred and twenty hours (Note 4). The refluxing may be interrupted at any time for as long as desired. The liquid in the flask has now a specific gravity of about 0.91 (20\u00b0) which corresponds to about 80 per cent of diacetone alcohol (Note 5). The only loss of material is by volatilization of the acetone through the top of the condenser; this generally amounts to several per cent.\nThe crude diacetone alcohol is purified by distillation. The 2-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a three-bulbed Glinsky fractionating column and a well-cooled condenser. The flask is heated in an oil bath, the temperature of which is gradually raised to 125\u00b0. The temperature of the bath is held at this point until no more acetone distils over, the temperature at the top of the column registering about 70\u00b0 when the process is complete. The recovered acetone, containing a few per cent of diacetone alcohol, amounts to about 200 g. and can be used to prepare more material. The residual liquid has a specific gravity of 0.928 (20\u00b0) and contains about 95 per cent of diacetone alcohol. It is transferred to a 2-l. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure (Note 6). A little acetone first comes over and then the diacetone alcohol distils smoothly at 71\u201374\u00b0/23 mm. The yield is 850 g. (71 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the total acetone employed). The entire distillation requires about four hours."

Heat is applied from a ring burner, the flame being adjusted so that the liquid distils at a rapid rate.\nThe distillation process is continued until practically no more furfural can be seen collecting in the distilling flask used as a receiver. The above operation requires from five to ten hours.\nThis distillate is now treated with enough sodium hydroxide so that the mixture is left just faintly acid, and the furfural separated. It amounts to 180\u2013220 g. The wet furfural is distilled under reduced pressure from a Claisen flask which is heated in an oil bath (Note 3).

The distillation of the crude material must not be carried out under ordinary pressure; otherwise the product turns dark rapidly on standing. After one distillation under reduced pressure as described, however, a distillation under atmospheric pressure may be carried out without the objectionable results just mentioned (Note 4)."

To this is added 500 cc. of the sodium arsenite solution [prepared from 274 g. (1.38 moles) of c. p. arsenious oxide, 532 g. (13.3 moles) of sodium hydroxide, and 2600 cc. of water] (Note 3).

If the temperature is allowed to go much higher, especially at the beginning of the experiment, the reaction becomes too vigorous, and at the same time a little methyl iodide is formed.

The whole mixture is then kept one hour at 60\u201365\u00b0 to make sure that the reaction is completed.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool somewhat (to about 40\u00b0) and is filtered with suction in order to remove the mechanical impurities which have come from the technical arsenious oxide and sodium hydroxide. The filtrate consists of a clear water solution with a pale yellow oil underneath. It is better not to allow the reaction mixture to cool completely before filtering or else a precipitate of sodium arsenate will gradually separate and this will tend to make an emulsion of the methylene iodide and hinder filtration and separation. The methylene iodide is now separated from the filtrate, dried with a little calcium chloride, and then distilled under reduced pressure.

            "For the most satisfactory preparation of methylhexylcarbinol from castor oil, in moderately large-sized runs, a copper vessel should be used (B). Since such a vessel is often not available in the average laboratory, directions are also included using an ordinary can (A), although in such cases the yields are much lower, and relatively smaller quantities of materials are used.\n(A) Preparation in Tin Vessel.\u2014In a large dish pan, 1900 g. (6.4 moles) of No. AAA castor oil (Note 1) is treated with occasional stirring with a solution of 500 g. (12.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. A reaction takes place, some heat is developed, and within ten or fifteen minutes a very hard solid soap is produced. This soap is broken up into small pieces and placed in a 3-gallon (12-l.) can (Note 2). In this preparation, a petroleum ether can was used, but any kind available would be just as satisfactory. The container is now fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, and it is then heated over a ring burner as long as hydrogen is evolved. The heating is regulated to produce a fairly rapid evolution of gas as shown by leading a tube from the top of the condenser into a small beaker of water. The time required for the complete evolution of the hydrogen is about nine to ten hours.\nIf the above reaction is not completed at one time and intermediate cooling is allowed, the reaction mixture sets to a solid mass and certain precautions must be taken before proceeding further. Either before heating is renewed the mass must be punched full of holes by means of an iron rod, or when the heating is started care must be taken to heat the upper part of the can first and gradually to approach the bottom. If the under part of the solid soap were heated directly, it would decompose before the upper part, and the hydrogen, being unable to escape, would cause the can to burst.\nThe condenser is now set downward for distillation and the heating is continued. If intermediate cooling is allowed, one of the precautions mentioned above must be observed before starting the distillation. The alcohol distils over with the water and is separated from time to time, the water being returned to the distillation can by means of a separatory funnel inserted through a rubber stopper in the top of the can. The addition of this water must be very slow in order to prevent foaming (Note 3). The heating should be regulated so that the distillate is coming over in rapid drops, not in a stream. If desired, the same sort of gravity separator described below under the large-sized experiment (B) may be used in this small run. About twelve hours are required for this distillation (Note 4). Toward the end, high-boiling products are obtained and considerable gas is liberated. Difficulty is almost always encountered during this part of the preparation because the long heating causes the solder in the bottom edge of the can to melt and leaks thus develop which allow a certain amount of soap to run out. The distillation need not be stopped, because the soap fills the holes, but under these conditions the temperature cannot be maintained at a point high enough for the complete distillation without material loss from increased leakage. The upper layer of crude alcohol is separated from the water and fractionated. The portion boiling from 100\u2013120\u00b0 is chiefly water with a little alcohol in it. The second fraction between 120\u00b0 and 175\u00b0 contains a considerable quantity of ketones along with the alcohol (Note 4). The main portion distilling between 175\u00b0 and 185\u00b0 is the methylhexylcarbinol. Upon refractionation, 190\u2013200 g. (23\u201325 per cent of the theoretical amount) of alcohol boiling at 175\u2013180\u00b0 is obtained.\nThis product is satisfactory for most purposes. If, however, a very pure product is desired, this may be made by shaking carefully the alcohol with 15 per cent sodium bisulfite solution, separating the alcohol, and steam distilling it from alkaline solution. The alcohol is finally distilled, and the fraction boiling at 177\u2013179\u00b0 is collected. If saturated sodium bisulfite is employed, a crystalline material which contains alcohol is formed and causes difficulty in the separation (Note 5).\nTwo runs of 6 kg. of castor oil with the same relative proportions of alkali and water were made in 8-gallon (30-l.) cans. The yields of pure alcohol were 650 g. and 730 g. (25.8 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, of the theoretical amount on the basis of pure ester).\n(B) Preparation in Copper Vessel.\u2014To the cover of a 12-gallon (45-l.) copper kettle (Note 6) is fitted an apparatus to which a continuous separator may be attached (see Fig. 20).\nFig. 20.\nThis apparatus consists of an upright water condenser through the jacket of which steam is passed; a connecting tube leads from the top of this condenser to a second spiral condenser the bottom of which extends into a gravity separator. This allows the alcohol to run off into a receiver and the heavier aqueous layer to return through a separatory funnel to the copper kettle. A few essential points in the apparatus should be indicated: it is necessary that the return arm of the gravity separator be below the tube through which the alcohol flows into the receiver; the lower end of the funnel must be below the return side arm in order to prevent water being carried along with the methylhexylcarbinol; the capillaries A and B are necessary to prevent siphoning in the respective tubes.\nA soap is made as already described (A) from 11.2 kg. (37.6 moles) of No. AAA castor oil (Note 1) and 2900 g. (73 moles of sodium hydroxide in 5800 g. of water (Note 7). This is broken up, placed in the kettle, and gradually heated. Much gas is evolved, and care should be taken not to lose alcohol, particularly at the beginning. The separator is not adjusted and the stopcock of the separatory funnel is kept closed until about 3 l. of distillate is collected; any small amount of alcohol is separated and the water discarded (Note 7). The separator is now put in place to return the water to the kettle. The separatory funnel is allowed to fill with liquid and then the stopcock regulated so that the liquid flows back to the copper vessel as fast as it distils over. A return tube similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 22, p. 422, may be used, but in making methylhexylcarbinol the separatory funnel has the advantage that, if foaming occurs in the reaction flask, further addition of water can be immediately and easily stopped (Note 3).\nThe distillation is continued until no more alcohol comes over, a process which requires forty-eight to seventy-two hours of continuous heating. Superheating must be avoided, since foaming will then occur and may cause considerable difficulty. It is therefore advisable to adjust the heating so that the distillate comes over in rapid drops but not in a stream. If cooling is allowed to take place before the distillation is complete, it is advisable to break up the reaction cake before heating again, or to start the heating at the top of the cake and to approach the bottom gradually (Note 8). The crude product obtained is very much lighter in color than that produced when cans are used (A), and when it is distilled only very small fractions of low- or high-boiling material result. Moreover, the amount of ketones is small. The yields of the redistilled fraction boiling at 175\u2013180\u00b0 in three successive experiments were 1854 g., 1955 g., and 1894 g. (40\u201342 per cent of the theoretical amount), quantities about twice those obtained when cans are used (A). The time that one actually devotes to the production of methylhexylcarbinol is not great, but the total time necessary for carrying out a large experiment is almost a week."

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 2 kg. (15.9 moles) of pure crystallized oxalic acid which has been passed through a 10-mesh sieve, and 3 l. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 1). The flask is then fitted (Note 2) with a mechanical stirrer and the apparatus shown in Fig. 22.\nFig. 22.\nThis apparatus consists of an upright water condenser through the jacket of which steam is passed. A connecting tube leads from the top of this condenser to the top of a second efficient spiral condenser (Note 3), the bottom of which extends into a gravity separator. The water runs off into a receiver, and the heavier carbon tetrachloride layer returns to the reaction flask. A few essential points in the apparatus should be mentioned: it is necessary that the return arm of the gravity separator be below the tube through which the water flows into the receiver; the bottom of the funnel should be below the water outlet as in the diagram; the openings A and B are necessary to prevent siphoning in the respective tubes; and the last bend in the return tube before entering the reaction flask serves as a trap to prevent vapors from entering that tube.\nThe flask is placed up to its neck (Note 4) in hot water, stirring is started, and the steam is allowed to flow through the first upright condenser. The heating of the flask (Note 5) and vigorous stirring are continued until no more water passes through into the condenser. This point is indicated by the fact that no more water flows from the side arm of the separator. A slight milkiness in the carbon tetrachloride, which persists even when practically no more water comes over, need not be considered. The time of heating depends to a large extent on the rate with which the vapors are distilled over, and this rate in turn depends largely on the efficiency of the condenser. With an ordinary apparatus, such as that described, the time necessary will be approximately eighteen to twenty-four hours.\nThe reaction mixture is now filtered with suction, care being taken that any oxalic acid which is crusted above the surface of the carbon tetrachloride is not removed with the main portion of the product. The carbon tetrachloride may be used again for another run (Note 6), and the anhydrous oxalic acid is dried by short exposure to a warm dry atmosphere. The yield of product amounts to more than 90 per cent of the theoretical amount.",
            "A laboratory oven (Note 1) is equipped with as many clay plates or enameled pie plates or trays as it will accommodate and is adjusted to operate at 98\u201399\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3). When the temperature has become constant the plates are removed, rapidly covered with a layer (not over 3\u20134 mm. deep) of pulverized (Note 4) hydrated oxalic acid, and then quickly replaced in the oven. The temperature will drop slightly for a few minutes (Note 5). After the oven has regained the temperature for which it was adjusted, it is heated for two hours longer at this temperature. The product is then removed, crushed if slightly caked, and quickly bottled. The yield from 100 g. of hydrated oxalic acid is 69\u201370 g. (96\u201398 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6). The product is 99.5\u2013100 per cent pure, as indicated by titration with standard alkali (Note 7)."

The mixture becomes very cold and is kept at \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 by means of an ice-salt bath. Mechanical stirring is started and 600 g. (3.4 moles) of crude benzenesulfonyl chloride (p. 84) is gradually introduced (one-half hour) (Note 1). Then 1.2 kg. (16.5 atoms) of zinc dust (90 per cent) is added (Note 2) in portions as rapidly as possible without allowing the temperature to rise above that mentioned (this requires about one-half hour) (Note 3). The contents of the flask are stirred for one to one and one-half hours longer, the temperature being kept at 0\u00b0 or below during the whole period. A stopper holding an efficient reflux condenser (lower end not constricted) and stirrer is now attached; the ice bath is removed (Note 4); and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm up spontaneously or it may be warmed up with a low flame, the stirring being continued. Within a very few (two to five) minutes, in many runs, a rather vigorous reaction with the evolution of much hydrogen takes place. Under these circumstances it is advisable to cool the flask momentarily by a stream of water. The reflux condenser will, however, generally take care of the vapors satisfactorily.\nAfter the first ebullition has subsided, no further attention is required, and the mixture is heated to boiling over a ring burner until the solution becomes clear. The stirring should be continued during the refluxing, and the stirrer should be arranged so as to suck the liquid downward from the surface. This helps distribute the zinc which holds hydrogen and floats on top of the liquid. About four to seven hours are required for the heating (Note 5). The thiophenol is then distilled with steam, this process requiring about one hour. The product is separated from the water, dried with calcium chloride (shaking with calcium chloride for three to five minutes is generally sufficient), and distilled. The crude material weighs 359 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount), and the pure compound boiling at 166\u2013169\u00b0 (71\u00b0/15mm.) weighs 340 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount).

        "Procedure": [
            "Five hundred grams (9.35 moles) of technical ammonium chloride and 1330 g. (14.8 moles) of paraformaldehyde are mixed and allowed to react as in the procedure described for the preparation of trimethylamine hydrochloride (p. 531). To obtain from this crude reaction mixture a water or alcohol solution of trimethylamine, it is not satisfactory merely to treat with alkali and lead the trimethylamine through the solvent, since the gas is inefficiently absorbed; in fact, it is almost impossible to get a concentrated solution in this way without loss of material. The best way to prepare a solution is to liquefy the trimethylamine (b.p. 3.5\u00b0) and in this form run it into the solvent. For this purpose, the 5-l. flask in which the initial reaction is carried out is fitted with a rubber stopper holding a separatory funnel and a glass tube for leading off the trimethylamine (Note 1). This tube is run into one opening of a large U-tube or Wolff bottle holding soda-lime for drying the gas. The exit tube from this drying bottle has a glass tube leading to the top of an upright condenser which consists of a spiral tube cooled with a freezing mixture (Fig. 29) (Note 2).\nFig. 29.\nThe bottom of this condenser leads through a rubber stopper fitting tightly in a 2- or 3-l. flask, holding the solvent and immersed in an ice-salt mixture. An exit tube from this flask leads to a Wolff bottle kept at a low temperature and holding a little solvent, and through this solvent any unabsorbed trimethylamine must bubble. The exit tube of this last Wolff bottle is closed with a soda-lime tube if an anhydrous solvent is being used (Note 3).\nThe separatory funnel is filled with sodium hydroxide solution (1100 g. in 2 l. of water) which is then allowed to flow into the reaction mixture at such a speed that, after the air in the apparatus has been replaced by trimethylamine, a continuous stream of drops of trimethylamine flows from the condenser into the solvent and practically no gas goes through the end Wolff bottle. At the beginning, the evolution of trimethylamine is rapid, and hence the addition of the alkali must be very slow (Note 4); as soon as the reaction mixture is partly decomposed, however, the alkali may be added more rapidly. After it has all been added, the reaction mixture is heated ten to fifteen minutes to make sure that all the amine is evolved. The time for this alkali treatment is about three to four hours.\nWith such an experiment as is described above, using 1000 g. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) in the solvent flask and about 150 g. in the end Wolff bottle, 1469 g. of solution is obtained in the main flask and 174 g. in the Wolff bottle, thus indicating that a total of 491 g. (89 per cent of the theoretical amount) of trimethylamine is present. There is thus obtained a 32 per cent solution in the main flask, which has a specific gravity of about 0.760 at +5\u00b0 (Note 5). By titration with standard hydrochloric acid (Note 6), the same amounts of trimethylamine are indicated as are found by weighing. In several experiments, the yields were consistently 85\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount (Note 7)."

        "Procedure": [
            "Five hundred grams (9.35 moles) of technical ammonium chloride and 1330 g. (14.8 moles) of paraformaldehyde are thoroughly mixed and placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a long reflux condenser (a jacket of about 100-cm. length and an inner tube of about 2-cm. diameter) (Note 1). By means of an oil bath, the temperature of the reaction mixture is gradually raised. Between 85\u00b0 and 105\u00b0 liquefaction begins to take place at the bottom of the flask, and at the same time a very vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide starts. The heat is at once withdrawn, and if the reaction is too violent, the oil bath should be removed. The reaction is allowed to continue without further heating until the gas evolution is less vigorous. This requires about one and one-half hours. Heat is again applied and the temperature of the bath raised to about 160\u00b0, where it is held until there is practically no more evolution of carbon dioxide. This takes two and one-half to three and one-half hours, after which time the reaction is complete.\nTo obtain the trimethylamine hydrochloride, it is now merely necessary to treat the mixture with sodium hydroxide, and to distil the free amine into hydrochloric acid. A separatory funnel is therefore inserted through the stopper of the flask and the reflux condenser is changed to a downward position for distillation. The open end of the condenser is fitted tightly into the neck of a distilling flask or suction flask, to the outside arm of which is attached, by means of rubber tubing, a glass tube which leads under hydrochloric acid in a receiver. Care must be taken to have all the joints in the apparatus tight as the trimethylamine is very volatile and can easily be lost. The object of the intermediate boiling or suction flask is to catch any water which may distil with the trimethylamine during the treatment with the sodium hydroxide. This water is often colored yellow, and if allowed to go directly into the hydrochloric acid in the receiver contaminates the trimethylamine hydrochloride.\nA solution of 1100 g. of sodium hydroxide (two and one-half to three times the amount theoretically necessary to liberate the free amine) in 2 l. of water is allowed to drop through the separatory funnel into the reaction mixture, which has cooled somewhat during the change of apparatus. The amine distils, passes through the condenser, through the intermediate bottle, and into the receiver, in which is placed an amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid (930 cc. of sp. gr. 1.19) slightly more than enough to neutralize the weight of amine which should theoretically be formed. To be certain that all the amine has been driven from the reaction flask, heat is finally applied for ten or fifteen minutes to the mixture. The whole procedure, from the beginning of the first reaction until a solution of trimethylamine hydrochloride is obtained, requires not more than six to seven hours.\nTo obtain the trimethylamine hydrochloride, the hydrochloric acid solution is evaporated, first over a free flame, and later, when the crystals start to form, on a steam bath. As the solution gets more and more concentrated, the trimethylamine hydrochloride crystallizes out and is filtered from time to time, dried for a few minutes in an air bath (temperature 100\u2013110\u00b0), and then kept in a tightly closed bottle. If the trimethylamine hydrochloride as it crystallizes is centrifuged, the product is obtained pure and dry at once. The average yield from four runs is 710 g. of pure trimethylamine hydrochloride and 82 g. of product which is tinged slightly yellow (a total of 89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the ammonium chloride) (Note 2). The coloration results from the evaporation to dryness of the very last portion of solution."

(1225 cc.) of 95 per cent alcohol are introduced into a 5.5-l. bottle which is loosely covered with a perforated disk of cardboard, supplied with an effective stirrer, and supported in a larger vessel so as to permit cooling with cracked ice. Into the alkaline solution, 520 g. (4.3 moles) of pure acetophenone (Note 1) is poured, the bottle is rapidly surrounded with cracked ice, and the stirrer started; 460 g. (4.3 moles) of u. s. p. benzaldehyde (Note 2) is then added at once. The temperature of the mixture should not be below 15\u00b0 and it should not be allowed to rise above 30\u00b0 during the reaction (Note 3). If it tends to do so, the stirring is not sufficiently vigorous.\nIt is advantageous, though not essential, to inoculate the mixture with a little powdered benzalacetophenone after stirring for one-half hour. After two to three hours, the mixture becomes so thick that the stirring is no longer effective. The stirrer is then removed and the mixture left to itself in an ice box for about ten hours. The mixture now is a thick paste composed of small shot-like grains suspended in an almost colorless liquid. It is cooled in a freezing mixture and then either centrifuged or filtered on a large B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with water until the washings are neutral to litmus, and finally washed with 200 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, which has previously been cooled to 0\u00b0. After thorough drying in the air, the crude product weighs about 880 g. (97 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 50\u201354\u00b0. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes but tenaciously holds traces of water. It is most readily purified by recrystallization from four to four and one-half times its weight of 95 per cent alcohol (Note 4). Eight hundred and eighty grams of crude product give 770 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of light yellow material (m. p. 55\u201357\u00b0) and 40\u201350 g. that require recrystallization."

The precipitate of p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride is filtered off with suction, then washed with about 300 cc. of dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid.\nIn a 2-l. beaker, 180 g. (1.5 moles) of technical dimethylaniline, 125 cc. of formaldehyde (technical 40 per cent) (see Note 1 on p. 378), and 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid are mixed and heated for ten minutes on a steam bath. The mixture is now placed in a hood and the p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride added all at once, or as rapidly as possible. The beaker is then covered with a watch glass. A vigorous reaction soon occurs and is complete in about five minutes. The resulting solution is transferred to a 5-l. flask and diluted to 4 l.; stirring is started, and a 25 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide is added until the red color disappears (about 650 cc. is required). The yellow benzylidene compound separates, is filtered with suction, and washed with water. The moist precipitate is transferred to a 4-l. glass jar, covered with 1 l. of 50 per cent acetic acid and 250 cc. of formaldehyde, and stirred until twenty minutes after the benzylidene compound has gone into solution. While the mixture is being stirred vigorously (Note 1) to prevent lumping of the precipitate, 400 cc. of water and 200 g. of cracked ice are added during the course of five minutes. The dimethylaminobenzaldehyde generally separates gradually in fifteen to twenty minutes, but in some cases does not. If the precipitate does not form, the solution is placed in a refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. The mixture is filtered with suction and washed at least ten times with 300-cc. portions of water (Note 2). The precipitate is sucked as dry as possible for fifteen to thirty minutes (Note 3).\nThe slightly moist aldehyde is distilled under diminished pressure from an oil bath, by means of a 1-l. Claisen flask (Note 4). A small amount of water comes over first, then the thermometer rises rapidly to the boiling point of the aldehyde (180\u00b0/22 mm.). In changing receivers between the water fraction and the aldehyde, care should be taken to keep the side arm of the distilling flask warm; otherwise, on starting the distillation again, the aldehyde will solidify in the side arm and cause trouble. It is advisable not to collect the very last portion of the distillate with the main portion, as the former is frequently quite red. This is best added to crude material from another run. The main distillate is dissolved in 100 cc. of alcohol in a 2-l. beaker, then 1 l. of water is gradually added with vigorous mechanical stirring to prevent lumping. The aldehyde separates, and is filtered with suction. The product, when dry, weighs 125\u2013130 g. (56\u201359 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 73\u00b0.\nThe aldehyde prepared in this way is in the form of small granular crystals, which vary in different runs from a flesh color to a lemon yellow. For practically all purposes, this slightly colored product is entirely satisfactory and is essentially pure, as can be judged by the melting point. For reagent purposes it is desirable to remove the color completely, particularly since the product obtained as just described has a tendency to take on a reddish tinge on exposure to light. Further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the aldehyde (it dissolves slowly) in dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part of concentrated acid, sp. gr. 1.19, to 6 parts of water), 125 g. of aldehyde requiring 700 cc. of the acid (Note 5). The solution is placed in a jar and diluted with half its volume of water, and dilute sodium hydroxide solution (15\u201320 per cent) (Note 6) is added slowly with mechanical stirring. At the beginning, the aldehyde comes down slightly colored. After about 10\u201330 g. are precipitated, however, the product appears white (Note 7); this point can be readily seen. The first precipitate is filtered off and added to the next run of crude material or fractionally precipitated again from hydrochloric acid (Note 2). The rest of the aldehyde is now precipitated by means of more sodium hydroxide solution, and comes down almost white. At the very end of the neutralization, particularly if the original product was quite yellow, the last 4\u20135 g. of aldehyde should be precipitated separately, as this is inclined to be slightly colored. If too much alkali is added towards the end of the neutralization, a brown color appears, but the addition of a little hydrochloric acid will destroy this color. The main portion of the precipitate is filtered and dried; it weighs 95\u2013100 g. and melts at 73\u00b0. The succeeding runs yield 115\u2013128 g. of finished product, on account of the extra crude material obtained from the distillation and reprecipitation of the previous run (Note 8)."

            "One kilogram (805 cc., 9.8 moles) of 90 per cent glycerol (sp. gr., 1.243) and 20 g. of acetic acid are placed in a weighed 2-l. flask which is immersed in an oil bath heated to 100\u2013110\u00b0 (Note 1). The flask is fitted with a two-holed stopper, which carries a long tube reaching to the bottom of the flask and a short exit tube. The long tube is connected to a hydrogen chloride generator (Note 2); the short one, to a catch-bottle and some system for absorbing any excess of hydrogen chloride (see Fig. 7 on p. 97). A stream of dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. The absorption of gas is very rapid at the start but gradually falls off towards the end of the reaction; the stream of hydrogen chloride should be regulated accordingly. The flask is removed from time to time and weighed; when the absorption of gas practically ceases, the increase in weight will be about 875 g. (25 per cent more than the theoretical amount).\nThe product is now cooled, placed in a 4-l. beaker, and treated with solid sodium carbonate until just alkaline to litmus. water is added from time to time, to facilitate the reaction with the sodium carbonate and to prevent the separation of salt; about 500 cc. is required. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer separated. The crude dichlorohydrin, which weighs 1250 g., is distilled under reduced pressure. The first fraction boiling below 68\u00b0/14 mm. weighs 225 g., and consists of water and some dichlorohydrin; the dichlorohydrin is collected between 68\u00b0 and 75\u00b0/14 mm., and weighs about 775 g. The water is separated from the first fraction, which is then redistilled and yields 100 g. of dichlorohydrin. A further amount of material (40\u201345 g.) may be obtained by extracting the aqueous layer obtained in the neutralization process with benzene. This is, however, hardly profitable. The neutralization and distillation will require about four hours.\nThe 875 g. of dichlorohydrin thus obtained boils over a 7\u00b0 range; this is 70 per cent of the theoretical amount (Note 3). Redistillation yields 700\u2013720 g. boiling at 70\u201373\u00b0/14 mm. (55\u201357 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "A normal solution of sodium hypochlorite is prepared as follows: in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1800 g. of sodium hydroxide solution [300 g. (7.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide to 1500 g. of water] and 1500 g. of ice. Chlorine gas is then passed into the solution until it has gained in weight approximately 213 g. (3 moles). During this addition, the solution must be kept thoroughly cooled with ice, in order that chlorates will not be formed (Note 1). After all the chlorine has been passed in, it is necessary to be certain that the mixture is slightly alkaline, since any free chlorine in the solution prevents the formation of hydrazine.\nIn a 36-cm. evaporating dish are placed 1350 g. (1.5 l., 23 moles) of c.p. aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90), 900 cc. of distilled water (Note 2), 375 cc. of 10 per cent gelatine solution (Note 3), and 1200 cc. of the normal sodium hypochlorite solution prepared as above. This mixture is heated as rapidly as possible and boiled down until one-third of the original volume is left. This solution is then cooled thoroughly with ice and filtered with suction, first through two layers of toweling and then through one thickness of ordinary filter paper over cloth, in order to remove finely divided solid impurities. The solution is then placed in a precipitating jar, and cooled thoroughly (0\u00b0) with ice and salt; 10 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid for each 100 cc. of solution is gradually added with constant stirring (Note 4). A precipitate of hydrazine sulfate (NH2NH2 \u00b7 H2SO4) forms. The mixture is allowed to stand in the cold for a few hours in order to complete the precipitation, and is then filtered by suction in the usual way and the precipitate washed with cold alcohol. The yield varies from 53 g. to 58 g. per 1.5 l. of aqueous ammonia (34\u201337 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is perfectly white and crystalline, and satisfactory for almost any purpose. If a very pure product is desired, it must be recrystallized from water. For every 21 g. of crude product, 100 g. of boiling water is used. If the crude hydrazine is brown, it is advisable to use a little animal charcoal. After the mixture has been filtered and cooled to 0\u00b0, 19 g. of pure white crystals are obtained (Note 5)."

            "In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, arranged so that the contents can be mechanically stirred, is placed 4600 g. (5750 cc., 79 moles) of technical acetone. The flask is then well cooled with an ice and salt mixture, until the temperature of the acetone is between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 (Note 1). Stirring is started, and 4160 cc. of commercial concentrated sulfuric acid is run in at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture never rises above about 10\u00b0. This addition is accomplished in about five to ten hours. The stirring is continued for three to four hours longer, while the flask still remains immersed in the original freezing mixture to which no further amount of ice is added. The mixture is then allowed to stand at room temperature for eighteen to twenty-four hours (Note 2).\nA 5-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber stopper or a cork stopper coated with pitch (Note 3), carrying two glass tubes, one of which (for the entrance of steam) reaches to the bottom of the flask, while the other extends into the open end of a condenser set for downward distillation. The stopper should be wired into the flask. The glass delivery tube into the condenser should not be less than a 12-mm. bore, and the condenser should consist of two 120-cm. water-cooled condensers attached end to end. To the end of the condensing system, an adapter is attached, the small end of which is at least 8 mm. in bore and is fitted tightly into a stopper in a 2-l. suction flask. To the side arm of the suction flask is attached a tube leading to an exhaust fan, in order to carry away the gases which are evolved during the subsequent distillation (Note 4). In the 5-l. flask is placed about 2 l. of the sulfuric acid-acetone reaction mixture (Note 5), and the flask is then heated with a free flame and shaken occasionally. A reaction starts at the end of about fifteen or twenty minutes, as shown by the evolution of gas (chiefly sulfur dioxide), and is allowed to run for about three minutes (Note 6). At the end of this time, a current of steam is passed in and continued for about three minutes. During this period a large proportion of the mesitylene distils and should be kept separate from the subsequent distillate. The steam distillation is continued at such a rate that about 800 cc. distils in twenty-five to thirty minutes and is collected as a second distillate. At the end of this time, the distillation is stopped, the water poured off from the distilling flask, and the tarry material emptied out while hot into waste jars.\nThe total amount of original reaction mixture requires five distillations similar to the one just described. The first distillates from each of the five distillations are mixed, and the layer of mesitylene is separated from the water. This is shaken with sodium hydroxide solution until no more odor of sulfur dioxide is noticeable, then washed twice with water and distilled. The first portion of the distillate consists of a small amount of water and mesitylene and is added to the combined second distillates. The fraction which distils up to 210\u00b0 is saved. The second distillates are combined, washed in the same way as the first, and then distilled; the fraction which distils up to 210\u00b0 is combined with the corresponding fraction from the first distillates.\nThese combined fractions (which boil up to 210\u00b0) and 15 g. of sodium are placed in a 2-l. distilling flask, the side arm of which is closed with a rubber tube and pinchcock and which is fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated just below the boiling point for about three hours, during which time the impurities are attacked by the molten sodium, and a gelatinous, reddish mass forms. The reflux condenser is now removed and one set for downward distillation is attached to the side arm. The mixture is distilled and about two-thirds of the liquid removed in this way. The residue is cooled, the liquid poured off from solid material and distilled up to 210\u00b0.\nThe distillates from the sodium treatment are now fractionated with a good column (at least 30 cm. long), and the portion which boils at 163\u2013167\u00b0 is collected. The yield of this fraction varies from 430 to 470 g. (13\u201315 per cent of the theoretical amount), but very often will be as high as 500 g., and has reached, in certain experiments, 600 g.

            "Six hundred and eighty-five grams (4.75 moles) of technical anthranilic acid (generally about 95 per cent pure) (Note 1) is dissolved in 1.5 l. of water and 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.17) (Note 2), by heating. The insoluble dark impurity present in small amounts is filtered off, and the filtrate is transferred to a 16-l. crock and chilled with stirring. It is then mixed with a mush of 2.5 kg. of ice and 750 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The crock is cooled externally with ice, and the contents stirred continuously. When the temperature reaches about 3\u00b0, a filtered solution of 360 g. (5 moles) of sodium nitrite in 700 cc. of water is dropped in slowly, through a long capillary tube reaching below the surface of the liquid (Note 3), until a faint but permanent reaction to starch-potassium iodide paper is obtained; the temperature is kept between 3 and 5\u00b0 (Note 4). This operation requires all but about 30 cc. of the nitrite solution and occupies one and one-half to two hours.\nTo the solution of the diazonium salt is now added 848 g. (885 cc., 7 moles) of dimethylaniline; this may be done rapidly, as the temperature does not rise appreciably. Stirring is continued for one hour, the temperature being kept at 5\u00b0. Five hundred cubic centimeters of a filtered solution of 680 g. (8.3 moles) of crystallized sodium acetate diluted to 1200 cc. is then added, and the stirring continued for four hours. If a foamy solid rises to the surface during this time and refuses to become incorporated by the stirrer, a few drops of ethyl acetate may be added to reduce the foam. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in an ice bath which is well insulated by several thicknesses of burlap; the temperature must be kept below 7\u00b0 to get a good yield of product. The remainder of the sodium acetate solution is then added with stirring, and, after the mixture has been stirred for an additional period of one to three hours, the temperature is allowed to rise slowly to 20\u201325\u00b0 in the course of twenty-four hours. Just enough sodium hydroxide solution is then added, with stirring, to cause the mixture to have a distinct odor of dimethylaniline (about 240 cc. of a 40 per cent solution is generally required), and the mixture is allowed to stand for forty-eight hours or longer at room temperature (20\u201325\u00b0) (Note 5).\nThe solid is then filtered off, washed first with water, then with 400 cc. of 10 per cent acetic acid (to remove the dimethylaniline), and finally with distilled water. The last filtrate is generally pale pink. The solid is sucked as dry as possible, spread out on a tray in order to allow most of the water to evaporate (fifteen to twenty hours), and then suspended in 4 l. of methyl alcohol in a 12-l. flask. This mixture is stirred on the steam bath under a reflux condenser for one to two hours, allowed to cool slowly, and then chilled in an ice bath and filtered. The solid product is washed with a second 4 l. of cold methyl alcohol (Note 6). After being dried in air, it varies in weight from 820 to 870 g.\nThe product is extracted with boiling toluene in the following manner: 150 g. is placed in a fluted filter paper of 29-cm. diameter in a 25-cm. glass funnel which passes through the cork of a 2-l. flat-bottomed conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\nThe flask is heated on an electric stove, and a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, clamped to a ring stand, is placed on the funnel to act as a condenser, cold water being run through the flask. The toluene is boiled until the condensed liquid runs through almost colorless (this requires from four to ten hours). The heating is then discontinued, and, as soon as the liquid ceases to boil, the flask is removed to a bath containing water at 90\u2013100\u00b0; the level of the water should be slightly above the level of the liquid in the flask. This arrangement permits the temperature to fall slowly so that large crystals are obtained. In the meantime a second conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene is attached to the funnel, and a new charge of 150 g. of crude methyl red is placed in the paper. The process is repeated until all the crude material has been so treated. When extraction is complete it is found that a certain amount of black amorphous insoluble matter remains on the filter; this is discarded. The crystals of methyl red (Note 7) are filtered off and washed with a little toluene. The weight of pure material is 755\u2013805 g. The mother liquors are concentrated to one-fourth of their volume, and the crystals which separate on cooling are recrystallized from fresh toluene. The recovered toluene can, of course, be employed again. The total yield of pure methyl red is 790\u2013840 g. (62\u201366 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8). It melts at 181\u2013182\u00b0.\nThe watery mother liquors from the crude methyl red are rendered alkaline with sodium hydroxide and distilled until no more dimethylaniline passes over. In this way 250 to 400 g. of moist dimethylaniline is recovered."

Stirring is started, and 1700 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid is allowed to flow in during about thirty minutes (Note 1). The heat of dilution of the sulfuric acid will cause the nitrotoluene to melt, and rapid oxidation will soon take place. The last half of the sulfuric acid must be added gradually, in order to prevent too violent a reaction. Since a small amount of nitrotoluene is volatilized, it is advisable to carry on this work under a hood.\nAfter the sulfuric acid has been added and the spontaneous heating of the reaction mixture has subsided, the mixture is heated to gentle boiling for about one-half hour (Note 2). When the reaction mixture has cooled, 2 l. of water is added, the cooled solution is filtered through a cloth filter, and the product washed with about 1 l. of water. In order to remove the chromium salts as completely as possible, the crude p-nitrobenzoic acid is warmed on the water bath and agitated with 1 l. of dilute (5 per cent) sulfuric acid solution (Note 3). After cooling, the product is again filtered. It is then dissolved in 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, filtered from any chromium hydroxide remaining, and also from unchanged nitrotoluene. The filtrate, which should be light yellow or greenish in color, is acidified with dilute sulfuric acid, with stirring. It is usually preferable to run the alkaline solution into the dilute sulfuric acid, rather than to use the reverse procedure, for the precipitation of the nitro acid (Note 4). The precipitated product is filtered with suction, washed thoroughly, and dried. The product should have only a light lemon color. The yield is 230\u2013240 g. (82\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nFor a product of special purity, crystallization from benzene is advisable. For most purposes, however, the nitrobenzoic acid may be used without crystallization, since its melting point is found to be within 2\u00b0 of the correct value of 238\u00b0."

(0.85 mole) of benzyl cyanide (free from alcohol and water) (Note 2) is run in slowly, at such a rate that the temperature remains at about 10\u00b0 and does not exceed 20\u00b0. After all the benzyl cyanide has been added (about one hour), the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for one hour and then poured onto 1200 g. of crushed ice. A pasty mass slowly separates; more than half of this mass is p-nitrobenzyl cyanide, the other constituents being o-nitrobenzyl cyanide, and a variable amount of an oil which resists hydrolysis; apparently no dinitro compounds are formed. The mass is filtered on a porcelain funnel with suction, pressed well to remove as much oil as possible, and dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol. On cooling, p-nitrobenzyl cyanide crystallizes; the mother liquor, on distillation, gives an impure alcohol which can be used for the next run. Recrystallization from 550 cc. of 80 per cent alcohol (sp. gr. 0.86 to 0.87) yields 70\u201375 g.

The flask is surrounded with a freezing mixture of ice and salt, and, when the contents are at 0\u00b0, stirring is started and 500 g. of cracked ice is added, or more ice can be added and the external cooling dispensed with; then 372 g. (364 cc., 4 moles) of aniline, also cooled to 0\u00b0, is run in during five minutes. The mixture is treated with 500 g. more of cracked ice, and a cold solution (0\u00b0) of 290 g. (4 moles) of technical sodium nitrite dissolved in 600 cc. of water is allowed to run in slowly (twenty to thirty minutes) from a separatory funnel, the end of which is drawn to a small tip and reaches nearly to the bottom of the flask. During this addition, the stirrer is operated rather vigorously, and the temperature is kept as near 0\u00b0 as possible by the frequent addition of cracked ice (about 1 kg.).\nIn the meantime, a sodium sulfite solution is prepared by dissolving 890 g. (20 moles) of sodium hydroxide, of about 90 per cent purity, in about 1 l. of water and then diluting to 6 l. A few drops of phenolphthalein solution are added and sulfur dioxide passed in, first until an acid reaction is indicated and then for two or three minutes longer. During the addition of the sulfur dioxide, the solution is cooled with running water. On account of the strong alkaline solution, the original color produced by the phenolphthalein is very faint, but this slowly increases until it becomes deep just before the acid point is reached. It is best to remove a small sample of the liquid from time to time, dilute with three or four volumes of water, and add a drop more of phenolphthalein (Note 1).\nThe sodium sulfite solution is placed in a 12-l. flask and cooled to about 5\u00b0. Approximately 500 g. of cracked ice is added, and then, with mechanical stirring, the diazonium salt solution is run in as rapidly as possible (Note 2). The mixture becomes a bright orangered. The flask is now warmed to about 20\u00b0 on a steam bath, until the solid sodium sulfite, which has separated while cooling, redissolves. The total amount of liquid is now about 10 l. One-half of this is poured into another 12-l. flask, and both halves are warmed on the steam bath to 60\u201370\u00b0, until the color becomes quite dark (thirty to sixty minutes). Sufficient hydrochloric acid (300\u2013400 cc.) is now added (Note 3) to each flask to make the solutions acid to litmus. The heating is continued and the color gradually becomes lighter until, after four to six hours, the solutions have become nearly colorless; they may be heated overnight, if desired.\nTo the hot solutions is now added about one-third of their volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (2 l. to each portion), and the mixtures are cooled, first in running water, then in a freezing mixture, to 0\u00b0 (Note 4). The phenylhydrazine hydrochloride precipitates in the form of slightly yellowish or pinkish crystals which may be filtered off and dried (Note 5).\nThe free base is liberated by adding to the phenylhydrazine hydrochloride 1 l. of a 25 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide. The phenylhydrazine separates and is taken up with benzene (two 300-cc. portions). The combined extractions are well dried with 200 g. of solid sodium hydroxide (Note 6), poured off, and distilled. Most of the benzene may be distilled under ordinary pressure, and the remainder, and any low-boiling impurities, under diminished pressure. The pure phenylhydrazine boils at 137\u2013138\u00b0/18 mm., and is obtained as a pale yellow liquid (Note 7). It can be crystallized on cooling in an ice bath; the crystals melt at 23\u00b0. The crude phenylhydrazine from two lots of aniline (744 g.) is best distilled at one time and gives 695\u2013725 g. of pure product (80\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

The contents of the flask are well mixed and the mixture heated gently over a free flame. As soon as the liquid begins to boil, the flame is removed, since the heat evolved by the reaction is sufficient to keep the mixture boiling for one-half to one hour. If the reaction proceeds too violently at the beginning, the reflux condenser may be assisted by placing a wet towel over the upper part of the flask. When the boiling has ceased the heat is again applied and the mixture boiled for five hours. It is then allowed to cool to about 100\u00b0 and transferred to a 12-l. flask; the 5-l. flask is rinsed out with a small quantity of water.\nThe 12-l. flask is then connected with the steam-distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 24, a 12-l. flask being used as a receiver (Note 4); steam is passed in (without external heat) until 1500 cc. has distilled (ten to thirty minutes). This removes all the unchanged nitrobenzene (10\u201320 cc.). The current of steam is then interrupted, the receiver is changed, and 1.5 kg. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added cautiously through the steam inlet. The heat of neutralization is sufficient to cause the liquids to boil and thus become thoroughly mixed. Steam is then passed in as rapidly as possible until all the quinoline has distilled. In this process, 6\u20138 l. of distillate is collected (two and one-half to three and one-half hours are required, unless a very efficient condensing apparatus is used, under which conditions the distillation may be complete in one-half to one and one-half hours). The distillate is allowed to cool, and the crude quinoline separated. The aqueous layer of the distillate is again distilled with steam until all the quinoline has been volatilized and collected in about 3 l. of distillate.\nFig. 24.\nThis 3 l. of distillate is then mixed with the first yield of quinoline, and 280 g. (150 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added. The solution is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0, and a saturated solution of sodium nitrite added until a distinct excess of nitrous acid is present (as shown either by starch-potassium iodide paper or by the odor). This generally requires 50 to 70 g. of sodium nitrite. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath for one hour, or until active evolution of gas ceases, and is then distilled with steam until all the volatile material has been expelled (4 l. of distillate will result). The receiver is then changed and the mixture in the distillation flask is neutralized, as before, with 700 g. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The quinoline is distilled exactly as described above, the aqueous portions of the distillate being distilled with steam until all the quinoline has been isolated. The crude product is then distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 110\u2013114\u00b0/14 mm. is collected. The forerun is separated from any water which may be present, dried with a little solid alkali, and redistilled. The total yield is 255\u2013275 g. (84\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the aniline taken) (Note 5)."

A concentrated solution of technical sodium dichromate is prepared by dissolving 140 g. (0.47 mole) in 65 cc. of water (Note 2). This solution is then added gradually to the hydroquinone solution, with the use of a mechanical stirrer (Note 3), the mixture being cooled so that the temperature never rises above 30\u00b0. At first a greenish-black precipitate forms, but, upon further addition of the sodium dichromate solution, the color changes to yellowish green. As soon as this color remains permanent (a slight excess of sodium dichromate does no harm) the reaction is complete. This requires about one-half to three-quarters of an hour; 90\u2013110 cc. of sodium dichromate solution is necessary. The mixture is then cooled to about 10\u00b0 and filtered with suction.

It is dried while hot by stirring a short time with a little calcium chloride, and then filtered through an ordinary funnel into a 1-l. distilling flask before it cools. There is a certain amount of quinone which does not go into the 500 cc. of benzene, so that the residue is extracted a second time with about 100 cc. of benzene, which is dried and filtered with the first extract. During these extractions (Note 4), the benzene should not be at the boiling point, as this will cause a considerable volatilization of the quinone.\nThe distilling flask is now attached to a condenser set for downward distillation, and the benzene is distilled. As soon as the quinone starts to separate, the residue in the flask is transferred to a beaker and cooled in an ice bath. The precipitate is filtered off with suction and the product spread out for a short time to dry. The product is yellow in color and weighs 75 to 80 g. (76\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount). Material made in this way will hold its yellow color over long periods of time, provided it is protected from light.\nThe benzene distillate is yellow and contains some quinone. This, as well as the benzene from the final filtration of the quinone crystals, may be used in a subsequent run and thus raises the yield of the subsequent runs to about 85\u201390 g. (86\u201392 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5)."

            "Five hundred grams (2.6 moles) of technical p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is ground in a mortar to break up all lumps. Three liters of water is placed in a 12-l. crock provided with a large brass stirrer and a tube for passing steam directly into the liquid. Dry steam is passed into the water until the temperature reaches 70\u00b0. The steam is then shut off and 400 g. (5.5\u20136.1 atoms) of zinc dust (90 to 100 per cent pure) is added. The sulfonyl chloride is then added in small portions by means of a porcelain spoon. The addition takes about ten minutes. The temperature rises to about 80\u00b0. Stirring is continued for ten minutes after the last of the chloride has been added. Steam is then passed into the mixture until the temperature reaches 90\u00b0. If it is heated any hotter, bumping takes place. The steam is shut off, and 250 cc. of 12 N sodium hydroxide solution is added. Finely powdered sodium carbonate is then added in 50-g. portions until the mixture is strongly alkaline. The mixture froths considerably, but this causes no trouble unless too small a crock is used. The stirrer is loosened and the crock is removed.\nThe mixture is filtered by suction in a large funnel. The filtrate has a volume of about 4.5 l. The cake of unchanged zinc dust and zinc compounds is transferred to a 3-l. battery jar and placed under the stirrer, and the latter is clamped in place. water (750 cc.) is added, the stirrer is started, and steam is passed in until the mixture starts to froth too violently. The steam is then shut off, but the stirring is continued for ten minutes. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is added to the main solution in a large evaporating dish. The liquid is evaporated over a large burner to a volume of about 1 l., or until a considerable crust forms around the edges. The mixture is then cooled. Large, flat, transparent crystals separate. The thoroughly cooled mixture is filtered by suction, and the crystals are air-dried until efflorescence just starts. They are then bottled. The product is p-CH3C6H4SO2Na\u00b72H2O. The yield is 360 g. (64 per cent of the theoretical amount). Careful acidification of the mother liquor with dilute hydrochloric acid yields 15 g. of the free sulfinic acid (Note 1)."

The filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. flask, and 70 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added.\nThe mixture is then gently heated (Note 3), with continuous stirring, when trinitrobenzene separates in crystalline condition and floats on the surface of the liquid as a frothy layer. After about one and one-half hours the evolution of gas ceases; at this point the crystals begin to stir into the solution. The heating and stirring are continued for three-quarters of an hour, when the mixture is allowed to cool, and the crystals filtered off. A sample of the filtrate should be tested for undecomposed trinitrobenzoic acid: if a precipitate is produced by the addition of sulfuric acid the process must be continued.

An air condenser 150\u2013200 cm. long may be employed. The mixture in the flask is heated to gentle boiling and the flame so regulated that the rate of distillation does not exceed 180 cc. per hour. The distillation is continued in this way for eight to ten hours, until the temperature at the head of the column reaches 110\u00b0. The distillate, which is a mixture of water and acetic acid, amounts to 1400\u20131500 cc. The receiver is changed, the flame under the flask is gradually increased, and the distillation is continued at about the same rate until the temperature at the head of the column rises to 140\u00b0. The distillate, which amounts to 500\u2013700 cc., is largely acetic acid and may be used in the next run.\nThe contents of the flask are transferred to a 2-l. flask for fractional distillation (p. 130), having a column 40\u201350 cm. long, and distilled under atmospheric pressure, using an air condenser. The fraction boiling below 210\u00b0, amounting to 250\u2013300 cc., is collected separately.

By redistilling the fraction boiling below 210\u00b0, the yield may be increased to 1200\u20131250 g. (87\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount). The acetamide thus obtained is pure enough for most purposes, but if a purer product is desired it may be recrystallized from a mixture of benzene and ethyl acetate; 1 l. of benzene and 300 cc. of ethyl acetate are used for 1 kg. of acetamide (Note 2). Colorless needles melting at 81\u00b0 are thus obtained (Note 3). The solvent and the acetamide it contains may be recovered by distillation."

            "In a 6-l. wide-mouthed bottle, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a separatory funnel, are placed 200 g. (1.39 moles) of \u03b1-naphthol melting at 91\u00b0 or higher (Note 1) and 910 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (2.5 moles). The mixture is stirred for ten minutes, at the end of which time it has become a homogeneous solution.\nWhile the naphthol is dissolving, a solution of benzenediazonium chloride is prepared. In a 3-l. wide-mouthed bottle are placed 128 g. (125 cc., 1.38 moles) of aniline and 1.5 kg. of cracked ice (Note 2), and upon this mixture while it is stirred (by hand) is poured 410 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (31.5 per cent; sp. gr. 1.16). Some crystals of aniline hydrochloride separate at this point. A solution of 100 g. (1.45 moles) of sodium nitrite in 200 cc. of water is now run in slowly from a 500-cc. separatory funnel. The tip of the stem of the separatory funnel should dip well below the surface of the liquid. The mixture is stirred (by hand if desired) and a drop is tested from time to time with starch-iodide paper. This is best done by diluting the test-drop on a watch glass with about 1 cc. of water and then placing a drop of this solution on the starch-iodide paper. The sodium nitrite solution is added until there is a test for nitrous acid which is permanent for five minutes. The diazotization is then complete; all but 2\u20135 per cent of the nitrite is required.\nTo the alkaline solution of \u03b1-naphthol is now added 1 kg. of cracked ice, the stirrer is started and the diazonium solution run in through a separatory funnel, the stem of which dips below the surface of the solution. The stirring must be uniform and efficient during the addition (Note 3). The addition of the diazonium solution should take ten minutes. Ice is added if necessary to keep the solution below 10\u00b0. The mixture is stirred for one-half hour after the addition of the diazonium solution and then allowed to stand for three hours at 7\u201310\u00b0 (Note 4). It is then filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with 1 l. of water and sucked as dry as possible.\nThe moist benzeneazo-\u03b1-naphthol is next transferred to a 5-l. wide-mouthed bottle or a 2-gallon (8-l.) crock equipped with a mechanical stirrer and containing 3 l. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is stirred for ten minutes to insure solution of the dye, and then filtered. The insoluble solid is stirred up with 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, filtered again and washed with water. The solid, which weighs 10\u201390 g., consists mainly of the 2,4-disazo derivative (m. p. 197\u2013198\u00b0), together with any benzeazo-\u03b2-naphthol that may be present.\nTo the deep-red solution is added 550 g. of sodium hydrosulfite (of at least 80 per cent purity); the mixture is stirred for five minutes and then for five thirty-second periods during one-half hour (Note 5). The solution slowly loses its red color (a thin layer of aniline collects on the surface), and the temperature rises from 25\u201350\u00b0. At the end of one-half hour the solution should no longer be red; it is then rapidly cooled to 20\u00b0 in a freezing bath and by the addition of about 500 g. of ice.\nTo the solution is now added, with stirring, 625 cc. (6.3 moles) of concentrated (31.5 per cent; sp. gr. 1.16) hydrochloric acid (Note 6) or its equivalent of acid of approximately the same strength. A cream-colored precipitate of the aminonaphthol forms. It is rapidly filtered off on a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 7) and washed with one portion (200 cc.) of water about half saturated with sulfur dioxide. The precipitate soon darkens on exposure to air and is therefore rapidly transferred to a 2-gallon (8-l.) crock containing 2 l. of water and 340 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The soft lumps are broken up with a cork stopper set on the end of a stirring rod. Steam is passed into the mixture for forty-five minutes, and during the last thirty minutes the mixture is stirred mechanically. At the end of this time the amine will have passed completely into solution. An insoluble impurity weighing 25\u201330 g. is removed by filtering with suction. The filtrate is cooled to 25\u00b0 and if it is not clear is filtered again. To the clear solution at 25\u00b0 is added 1200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid with stirring, when a light gray precipitate of the aminonaphtholhydrochloride immediately forms. The solution is allowed to stand for two to three hours and is then filtered with suction. The hydrochloride is sucked as free from mother liquor as possible, washed very thoroughly with hydrochloric acid (1 volume acid to 1 volume of water), and dried on a porous plate. The liquors are concentrated, under reduced pressure, to a small volume, and a second crop is thus obtained. The product is of a light purplish tint (Note 8) and weighs 175\u2013200 g. (65\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the quantity of \u03b1-naphthol employed) (Note 9)."

(0.55 mole) of p-nitrophenylacetic acid (p. 406) is now slowly introduced, with shaking. The flask is then placed in an ice bath, and the mixture saturated with hydrogen sulfide, the temperature being held below 50\u00b0.\nThe stopper is removed from the reaction flask, and the solution of ammonium p-aminophenylacetate gently boiled under the hood until nearly all the excess hydrogen sulfide and ammonia have escaped. The solution changes from a dark orange-red to a pale yellow. The deposited sulfur is filtered off by suction, and 40 cc. of glacial acetic acid rapidly stirred into the hot filtrate. The p-aminophenylacetic acid which crystallizes out weighs 69\u201370 g., but it is contaminated with a small amount of free sulfur. On evaporating the mother liquor to a small volume, about 5 g. more can be obtained. The crude material is recrystallized from 4 l. of distilled water, 69\u201370 g.

(800 cc.) of aniline (Note 2) in 100-cc. portions; meanwhile the lumps of aniline arsenate which are formed are broken up by rapid stirring with a porcelain spatula. When all the aniline has been added, the powdered solid is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the lower part of the vessel, and a condenser arranged for downward distillation (Note 3); an additional 800 cc. of aniline is added and the flask heated on an oil bath at 155\u2013160\u00b0 with stirring for four and one-half hours. The mass will have assumed an intense violet color.\nThe reaction mixture is poured into 700 cc. of water and the flask is washed out with a portion of a previously prepared solution of 330 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1400 cc. of water, the washings being added to the reaction mixture. The remainder of the alkali is then added and the mixture agitated and cooled under the tap. At this point two distinct layers are present, a lower pink-colored alkaline water layer, and an upper strongly colored aniline layer. The water layer is, while warm, carefully separated from the purple-colored oil by means of a separatory funnel (heated to prevent the separation of sodium arsanilate) and after treatment with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon is filtered through paper.\nThe arsanilic acid can be obtained from the aqueous alkaline solution either as the free acid or as the sodium salt. To obtain the free acid the solution is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid until the purple color of tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein is changed to a faint yellow. Care should be taken in the addition of the acid not to overstep the end-point (Note 4). Crystallization is stimulated by scratching, and the flask is allowed to stand overnight to complete the precipitation. The crystals of pinkish-yellow acid (Note 5) are filtered off, digested with 340 cc. of ethyl alcohol, filtered, and recrystallized from 2.5 l. of boiling water, adding 5\u20136 g. of Norite and filtering hot. This crystallization always produces a white product. The yield of thoroughly dry arsanilic acid is 147\u2013184 g. (10.9\u201314.5 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6), (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

To this mixture, 100 cc. of 10 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide is slowly added from a dropping funnel (Note 3), while the solution is stirred, and cooled by a water bath. The rate of addition of the alkali is so regulated that the temperature remains between 25\u201331\u00b0. This requires from one-half to one hour. The mixture is now stirred for two and one-quarter hours at room temperature (Note 4). At the end of this time dilute hydrochloric acid is added until the mixture is acid to litmus. The two layers which form are separated in a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer is extracted with 100 cc. of benzene, and the benzene solution added to the yellow oil which formed the upper layer in the first separation. This benzene solution is shaken with 100 cc. of water and separated.\nThe benzene is then removed by distilling from a steam bath, and the residue distilled under reduced pressure (Note 5), any water which condenses with the forerun being separated (Note 6).

            "In a 5-l. flask, provided with a two-holed stopper fitted with a 90-cm. fractionating column1 and a dropping funnel, are placed 1500 g. (12.3 moles) of benzoic acid, 1500 g. (1390 cc., 14.7 moles) of acetic anhydride (or an equivalent quantity of 95 per cent acetic anhydride), and 1 cc. of sirupy phosphoric acid. The mixture is very slowly distilled, at such a rate that the temperature of the vapor at the head of the column does not exceed 120\u00b0 (Note 1). When 250 cc. of distillate has been collected, 250 g. of acetic anhydride is added, and distillation is continued. This process is again repeated, so that in all 2000 g. (1850 cc., 19.6 moles) of acetic anhydride has been taken. Fractionation is then continued, fractions which distil respectively below 120\u00b0, at 120\u2013130\u00b0, and at 130\u2013140\u00b0 being collected. Heating is continued until the temperature of the reaction mixture in the flask reaches 270\u00b0.\nThe residue is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, resulting in the collection of fractions which boil respectively below 165\u00b0, at 165\u2013210\u00b0, and at 210\u2013220\u00b0, all under 19\u201320 mm. pressure (Note 2). The lower fractions are mixed with the fraction which boils at 120\u2013130\u00b0, and distilled as before after the addition of one drop of phosphoric acid, when a further quantity of material boiling at 210\u2013222\u00b0 /20 mm. is obtained. This fraction, amounting to 1100\u20131200 g., consists of crude benzoic anhydride. The lower-boiling fractions may be redistilled until they become too small to justify further work.\nThe fraction which boils at 120\u2013130\u00b0 under atmospheric pressure is redistilled, yielding further quantities of acetic acid (below 120\u00b0) and acetic anhydride (130\u2013140\u00b0).\nThe crude benzoic anhydride (which is apt to supercool without crystallizing) contains a small proportion of an oily impurity which causes the product to turn yellow on standing; it is recrystallized by dissolving in benzene (50 cc. for each 100 g.) then adding just enough petroleum ether to cause a cloudiness (about 100 cc. is required) and chilling, when the pure anhydride separates in perfectly colorless and odorless crystals melting at 43\u00b0. The first crop amounts to about 50 per cent of the crude material taken; the mother liquors are freed of solvent by distillation on the water bath, and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, when a further quantity of pure material can be obtained by recrystallizing the distillate boiling at 210\u2013220\u00b0 /19 mm. If this process is repeated until the mother liquor becomes too small in amount to redistil satisfactorily, the yield of pure benzoic anhydride melting at 43\u00b0 amounts to 1000\u20131030 g. (72\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3). It is generally more convenient to distil the mother liquors only once or possibly twice, under which conditions a somewhat lower yield is obtained. The remaining mother liquors may then be mixed with a subsequent preparation."

The condenser is then arranged for downward distillation and a thermometer immersed in the reaction mixture; dilute hydrobromic acid is distilled off until the temperature in the flask reaches 121\u00b0, whereupon the receiver is changed and a fraction consisting of stronger hydrobromic acid is collected over the range 121\u2013129\u00b0. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 129\u00b0, very little hydrobromic acid remains, and on cooling, the mass sets to an almost colorless solid. This is now dissolved in 2000 cc. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 2), and the ammonium bromide is filtered off and washed with 500 cc. more of the solvent; a thin aqueous layer is separated and 1500 cc. of the carbon tetrachloride distilled from the filtrate.

(1.2 moles) of 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide. The mixture darkens slightly in color and the temperature rises to 45\u201350\u00b0. The solution is allowed to stand for fifteen to twenty hours, whereupon a few drops of acetic acid are added in order to neutralize any excess alkali, and the solution evaporated to complete dryness on the water bath under reduced pressure.\nThe solid residue is finely crushed and warmed nearly to boiling with 500 cc. of toluene; the mixture is then poured into the folded filter paper of an extraction apparatus (p. 375) and extracted with boiling toluene for five hours. The toluene is allowed to cool and is decanted from the catechol, which crystallizes out. The insoluble material is again ground up and extracted in the apparatus with the decanted toluene. The combined product, weighing 70\u201376 g., consists of light brown plates melting at 104\u00b0, and is thus pure enough for many purposes. A further 6\u201312 g. of catechol can be obtained on distilling off the bulk of the toluene from the mother liquor. In order to obtain an entirely pure product, the crude catechol should be distilled under reduced pressure, when it passes over entirely at 119\u2013121\u00b0 /10 mm. (or 113\u2013115\u00b0 /8 mm.), and the distillate recrystallized from about five times its weight of toluene. In this way, colorless plates melting at 104\u2013105\u00b0 are obtained. The yield of the purified product is 76\u201380 g. (69\u201373 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 2).",
            "In a 5-l. flask fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the bottom, a fractionating column about 40 cm. long (Note 1), and a return inlet tube, are placed 912 g. (7.4 moles) of crystalline guaiacol and 1500 g. (1015 cc., 8.8 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid (p. 26). This apparatus is connected with a condenser, an automatic separator, and an absorption vessel, as shown in Fig. 10 (Note 2). The mixture is gently heated, with continual stirring, at such a rate that the vapor at the head of the column maintains a temperature of 85\u201395\u00b0. The mixture of water and guaiacol which condenses passes through the automatic separator (Note 3), the guaiacol being returned to the reaction vessel and the water collected in the tap funnel, from which it is removed from time to time. The gaseous methyl bromide is collected in an ice-cooled bottle containing a weighed quantity (about 1600 g.) of methyl alcohol (Note 4).\nFig. 10.\nAfter six to seven hours, the temperature at the head of the column begins to rise above 95\u00b0 and finally reaches 98\u00b0, at which point practically no more guaiacol passes over with the distillate. This requires about one hour more, after which the heating is stopped (Note 5). The increase in weight of the absorption bottle amounts to 400\u2013500 g. (57\u201372 per cent of the theoretical amount of methyl bromide); the water collected weighs 550\u2013560 g. (Note 6).\nThe residue in the flask, which has become pink in color, is extracted at 85\u201395\u00b0 with three 1500-cc. portions of toluene (Note 7), and the united extracts are distilled under reduced pressure on the steam bath until no more moisture passes over with the vapor. The solution (2\u20132.5 l.) is then allowed to cool, whereupon 385\u2013390 g. of catechol separates in colorless plates melting at 104\u2013105\u00b0. The mother liquor is further concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue finally distilled, pure catechol passing over at 124\u2013125\u00b0 / 12 mm. The distillate, on recrystallization from a small quantity of toluene, yields 8\u201310 g. of pure material.\nThe aqueous residue from the three extractions with toluene yields, when the bulk of the water has been distilled off on the steam bath under reduced pressure, a further quantity of catechol by extraction with hot toluene, but the crystals so obtained are contaminated with a red impurity. It is therefore preferable to distil the entire residue, again collecting the fraction boiling at 124\u2013125\u00b0 /12 mm. and recrystallizing it from fresh toluene. In this way 295\u2013305 g. of pure product is obtained. The forerun contains a little aqueous hydrobromic acid, which may be employed in a subsequent batch. The total yield of pure catechol is 690\u2013705 g. (85\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8)."

            "(A) Preparation of Cuprous Chloride Solution (Note 1).\u2014A solution of 1250 g. (5 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate and 325 g. (5.6 moles) of sodium chloride in 4 l. of hot water is prepared in a 12-l. flask. The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, and an alkaline solution of sodium sulfite (265 g. of sodium bisulfite and 175 g. of sodium hydroxide in 2 l. of water) is added during a period of five to ten minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and washed by decantation. The cuprous chloride is obtained as a white powder, which, however, darkens on exposure to the air. The crude product is dissolved in 2 kg. of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and the solution is used in the following preparation (Note 2).\n(B) o-Chlorotoluene.\u2014In a 10-l. stone jar fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 2 kg. (1755 cc.) of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and 428 g. (427 cc., 4 moles) of o-toluidine. The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 by adding cracked ice (about 1 kg. is required). The o-toluidine hydrochloride separates as a finely divided precipitate. The stirrer is started, and to the cold suspension is added a solution of 280 g. (4.05 moles) of sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water; the diazotization is carried out at 0\u20135\u00b0 and requires about fifteen minutes. Cracked ice is added from time to time to keep the temperature within the proper limits. The volume of the final solution is 5\u20136 l.\nWhile the diazotization is being carried out the cuprous chloride solution (A) is cooled to 0\u00b0. The cold diazonium solution is now poured rapidly into the well-stirred cuprous chloride solution. The solution becomes very thick, owing to the separation of an addition product between the diazonium salt and the cuprous chloride. The cold mixture is allowed to warm up to room temperature, and stirring is continued for two and one-half to three hours at this temperature (Note 3). When the temperature reaches about 15\u00b0, the solid addition compound begins to break down with the formation of nitrogen and o-chlorotoluene. After the specified time the solution is placed on a steam bath and heated to 60\u00b0 to complete the decomposition of the addition product. The o-chlorotoluene forms a layer on top of the copper salt solution. The water solution is drawn off through a siphon until only 5\u20136 l. remains. The remaining material is steam-distilled from a 12-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 4) until about 3.5\u20134 l. is collected in the distillate. The o-chlorotoluene layer is separated from the water, washed with cold concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 5) and then with water, and finally dried over calcium chloride. The product boiling at 155\u2013158\u00b0 weighs 375\u2013400 g. 74\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(C) p-Chlorotoluene.\u2014p-Chlorotoluene is prepared in exactly the same way starting with p-toluidine. The yields are 70\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount of a product which boils at 158\u2013162\u00b0 and melts at 4\u20137\u00b0."

            "One kilogram of technical sodium hydroxide and .400 g. of technical potassium hydroxide (Note 1) are melted together in a cast-iron flat-bottomed kettle, 18 cm. in depth and 18 cm. in diameter. The fused mass is well stirred by means of a piece of iron pipe closed at one end, containing a thermometer; the hand is protected by a rubber glove wrapped with a cloth. The temperature of the fused mass is allowed to fall to 230\u00b0, and 150 g. (0.73 mole) of technical sodium p-toluenesulfonate (Note 2) is stirred in. The temperature is now slowly raised while 450 g. (2.2 moles) more of sodium p-toluenesulfonate is added slowly, the additions being made whenever the melt becomes sufficiently thin to stir in the solid. When all has been added, the temperature should be about 270\u00b0; the addition requires about thirty minutes. The temperature is now raised to 300\u00b0, with occasional stirring. At this point there is a layer of heavy froth on the surface of the thin melt, and as the temperature rises this is stirred in, the whole melt becoming frothy and showing a tendency to foam over. On continuing to raise the temperature, the foaming suddenly disappears at about 330\u00b0; the melt becomes dark and evolution of hydrogen sets in. The mixture is now thin and of uniform consistency; it is poured at once into an iron tray and allowed to cool.\nThe solidified product is dissolved in 6-7 l. of water in a 12-l. flask, and a solution of concentrated (95 per cent) sulfuric acid (about 880 cc.) in about 2 l. of water is added until the liquor has a distinct odor of sulfur dioxide. The heat of neutralization is sufficient to cause the solution to boil; it is at once distilled in a current of steam (Note 3) until a sample of the distillate gives only a slight precipitate with bromine water. The distillate (about 6\u20137 l.) is saturated with salt and the oil separated. The watery solution may be again distilled with steam in order to recover the small amount of cresol in solution. The oil is at once distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 95\u201396\u00b0 /15 mm. is collected. The forerun is freed of water and redistilled, yielding a further quantity. On cooling, the product solidifies to a white, crystalline mass melting at 31\u00b0 (Note 4). The yield is 200\u2013230 g.

            "To a suspension of 300 g. (1.35\u20131.43 moles) of anthracene of 80\u201385 per cent purity in 3 l. of carbon tetrachloride (Note 1), in a 5-l. flask fitted with dropping funnel, stirrer, and reflux condenser, is added slowly 567 g. (182 cc., 3.55 moles) of bromine. The bromination takes place in the cold with separation of the sparingly soluble 9,10-dibromoanthracene; in order to prevent undissolved anthracene from becoming coated over, it is necessary to maintain vigorous stirring throughout the reaction. A tube from the top of the condenser conducts hydrogen bromide to cold water, in which it is absorbed (Note 2). The addition of the bromine occupies about one-half hour; the rate is so adjusted that a minimum of bromine is carried over with the hydrogen bromide.\nWhen all the bromine has been added, the mixture is gently warmed on a steam bath with continual stirring, care being taken not to heat so rapidly as to cause undue loss of bromine by entrainment. Heating is continued until the mixture has boiled gently for one hour. The mixture is then allowed to cool for some hours, without stirring, and the crude dibromoanthracene is filtered off, washed with a little cold carbon tetrachloride, and dried. In this way 270-425 g. of a bright yellow product, which melts (Note 3) at 218\u2013219\u00b0 (corr.), is obtained. On concentrating the mother liquors, 15\u2013150 g. more of crude material, m.p. about 216\u00b0 (corr.), can be obtained.\nTo prepare a purer product, the crude dibromoanthracene is extracted with carbon tetrachloride (Note 4) in an apparatus similar to that described on p. 375, the extraction is carried to the point at which crystals just begin to separate from the boiling solvent, and a fresh quantity of carbon tetrachloride is then taken. About eight extractions are necessary, 1 l. being used each time. The 9,10-dibromoanthracene so purified consists of brilliant yellow needles melting at 221\u2013222\u00b0 (corr.) (Note 5). A further quantity of pure product may be obtained by concentrating the mother liquor and recrystallizing the second crop so obtained. The recovered solvent may be employed for further extractions. The yield amounts to 400\u2013420 g. (83\u201388 per cent of the theoretical quantity based on anthracene of 85 per cent purity)."

            "In a 2-gallon (8-l.) wide-mouthed bottle (Note 1) packed in ice-salt mixture are placed 630 g. (8.7 moles) of commercial (95 per cent) sodium nitrite and 5 kg. of chopped ice, and the mixture is well stirred. A cold (0\u20135\u00b0) solution of sodium bisulfite, made by saturating with sulfur dioxide a solution of 495 g. (4.7 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 1500 cc. of water, is now added slowly with hand stirring. When all is in, a sufficiently large quantity of the ice will have melted to allow a mechanical stirrer to be fitted. A stream of sulfur dioxide is now passed in, with continual stirring, the temperature being kept at 0\u20132\u00b0, until an acid reaction to Congo red paper is obtained and the dark color, which appears just before the reaction is complete, has faded. During the addition of the sulfur dioxide, 500 g. more of ice may be added.\nThe mixture is now transferred to a 12-l. flask, 495 g. (625 cc., 8.5 moles) of acetone is added, and the solution is heated on the steam bath to 70\u00b0. Heating is then discontinued, the flask wrapped in burlap in order to retard loss of heat, and the mixture allowed to stand overnight. The acid is then neutralized with a concentrated (50 per cent) solution of sodium hydroxide (about 720 g. of alkali is required), until a distinctly alkaline reaction to litmus is just obtained.\nThe resulting acetoxime is now distilled in a current of steam (Note 2), and the distillation is continued until a 5-cc. sample, shaken with 2 cc. of ether, yields no appreciable residue on evaporating the ether. To the distillate (2\u20132.5 l.) is added 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the acid solution is distilled at atmospheric pressure until the distillate is free of acetone (Note 3). The residual liquor is then evaporated to dryness on the steam bath, either in an open dish or preferably under reduced pressure. The crude hydroxylamine hydrochloride so obtained, weighing 296\u2013470 g. (49\u201377 per cent of the theoretical amount), is suitable for many purposes, but is best purified by recrystallization from half its weight of water. By systematic recrystallization of the product from several batches, the yield of pure product, which crystallizes in long flat needles, melting when dry at 150\u2013154\u00b0, may be brought as high as 70 per cent of the theoretical amount (Note 4).\nIn order to prepare pure acetoxime (Note 5), the procedure is modified in the following way: After neutralizing the solution of acetoxime formed after the addition of acetone, the oily layer is separated and the aqueous solution shaken with two or three 150-cc. portions of benzene. The oil and benzene solutions are mixed, the water thereby thrown out is removed, and the oil fractionally distilled with the use of a column, the portion boiling 133\u2013136\u00b0 being collected as pure acetoxime. This product, which weighs 420\u2013480 g. (67\u201376 per cent of the theoretical amount), solidifies in the receiver to colorless needles melting at 60\u201361\u00b0. The foreruns and aqueous liquors are best distilled with steam and the distillate converted into hydroxylamine hydrochloride as above, whereupon 75\u201390 g. of pure salt is obtained."

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 5-l. round-buttoned flask, fitted with a stopper holding a condenser set for downward distillation and a thermometer which will extend well into the liquid, are placed 4 kg. (3711 cc., 47\u201353 moles) of technical formaldehyde (35\u201340 per cent; sp. gr. 1.078 at 20\u00b0) (see Note 1 on p. 378) and 2 kg. (37 moles) of technical ammonium chloride. The mixture is heated on the steam bath until no more distillate comes over and then over a flame until the temperature of the solution reaches 104\u00b0. The temperature is held at this point until no more distillate comes over (four to six hours). The distillate, which consists of methylal, methyl formate, and water, may be treated as described in (Note 1).\nThe contents of the reaction flask are cooled to room temperature (Note 2), and the ammonium chloride which separates is filtered off and centrifuged (Note 3). The mother liquor is concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure to 2500 cc., and again cooled to room temperature, whereupon a second crop of ammonium chloride is obtained. The total recovery of ammonium chloride up to this point amounts to 780\u2013815 g.\nThe mother liquor is again concentrated under reduced pressure until crystals begin to form on the surface of the solution (1400\u20131500 cc.). It is then cooled to room temperature, and a first crop of methylamine hydrochloride, containing some ammonium chloride, is obtained by filtering the cold solution and centrifuging the crystals (Note 3). At this point 625\u2013660 g. of crude product is obtained. The mother liquor is now concentrated under reduced pressure to about 1000 cc. and cooled; a second crop of methylamine hydrochloride (170\u2013190 g.) is then filtered off and centrifuged. This crop of crystals is washed with 250 cc. of cold chloroform, filtered, and centrifuged, in order to remove most of the dimethylamine hydrochloride which is present; after the washing with chloroform the product weighs 140\u2013150 g. The original mother liquor is then evaporated under reduced pressure, as far as possible, by heating on a steam bath, and the thick sirupy solution (about 350 cc.) which remains is poured into a beaker and allowed to cool, with occasional stirring, in order to prevent the formation of a solid cake (Note 2). The thick paste so obtained is centrifuged, and the crystals (170\u2013190 g.) are washed with 250 cc. of cold chloroform; the solution is filtered and the crystals are centrifuged, thus yielding 55\u201365 g. of product. There is no advantage in further concentrating the mother liquor.\nThe total yield of crude centrifuged methylamine hydrochloride is 830\u2013850 g. This product contains, as impurities, water, ammonium chloride, and some dimethylamine hydrochloride. In order to obtain a pure product, the crude methylamine hydrochloride is recrystallized from absolute alcohol (Note 4). The crude salt is placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser protected at the top with a calcium chloride tube; 2 l. of absolute alcohol is added and the mixture heated to boiling. After about one-half hour the undissolved material is allowed to settle and the clear solution is poured off. When the alcoholic solution is cooled, methylamine hydrochloride crystallizes out. It is filtered off and centrifuged, and the alcohol used for another extraction. The process is repeated until the alcohol dissolves no more of the product (about five extractions are necessary). In the flask 100\u2013150 g. of ammonium chloride remains, making the total recovery of ammonium chloride 850\u2013950 g. The yield of recrystallized methylamine hydrochloride is 600\u2013750 g. (45\u201351 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the ammonium chloride used up in the process) (Note 5) and (Note 6)."

The crude methyl m-nitrobenzoate separates as a solid and is filtered off by means of suction and washed with water.

The flask is provided with a calcium chloride tube from which emerges a tube leading to the surface of a flask of water, in order to absorb the hydrogen chloride formed during the reaction (Note 2). The flask is placed on a water bath and heated with occasional shaking until the reaction starts (fifteen to forty-five minutes). Vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride takes place, and the heating is continued until the reaction is complete (fifteen to thirty minutes after the reaction starts). There is thus formed a light yellow, homogeneous liquid.\nThe reaction mixture is now transferred to a Claisen flask connected with a water-cooled condenser, and the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at ordinary pressure by raising the temperature of the oil bath (Note 3) gradually to 200\u2013220\u00b0. The water condenser is then replaced by a short air-cooled condenser, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 4). A small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride first distils over, after which the receiver is changed and the temperature rises rapidly to the boiling point of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 197\u00b0/73 mm.

The white precipitate of cuprous chloride is filtered off, sucked dry as rapidly as possible, and suspended in a mixture of 2 l. of water and 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) (Note 1).\nIn the meantime, 552 g. (4 moles) of good commercial m-nitroaniline, melting at 110\u00b0 or above (Note 2), is dissolved in a mixture of 500 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 1 l. of hot water; 1100 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is then added, and the solution is cooled rapidly, with stirring. It is then surrounded with a freezing mixture, and diazotized at a temperature below 1\u00b0 by adding, with constant stirring, a solution of 288 g. (4 moles) of technical (95 per cent) sodium nitrite in 700 cc. of water, care being taken to avoid adding an excess over that necessary to produce a distinct reaction with starch-iodide paper (p. 49). This point is reached when all but about 25 cc. of the nitrite solution has been added; the addition requires about one and one-half hours. The cold solution is now filtered in order to remove some amorphous insoluble matter; this solid, when dry, weighs 50\u201355 g.\nThe clear filtrate, which has only a pale yellow color, is now run, with stirring, into the cuprous chloride solution in a 12-l. flask, while the temperature is kept at 25\u201330\u00b0 (Note 3). A somewhat sticky precipitate first forms, which later becomes crystalline; nitrogen is evolved in a continuous stream. The addition requires about thirty minutes. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath under an efficient reflux condenser until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. It is then distilled in a current of steam (using the apparatus described on p. 479) until no more chloronitrobenzene passed over; 9\u201310 l. of distillate collects during this process (Note 4). When quite cold, the water is decanted off, and the solid shaken with 1\u20132 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50\u00b0. The mixture is again allowed to cool, and the light yellow alkaline solution is decanted from the solid product, which is then collected on a filter, washed with a little cold water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. It boils completely at 116\u2013117\u00b0/12 mm. or 124\u2013125\u00b0/18 mm., and the distillate solidifies to a pale yellow solid which melts at 44\u201345\u00b0 and weighs 430\u2013450 g.

            "To a mixture of 500 g. (5.3 moles) of chloroacetic acid and 500 g. of cracked ice, is added, with stirring, just sufficient cold 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to make the solution faintly alkaline to phenolphthalein. About 360 cc. is required; the temperature should not rise above 20\u00b0 (Note 1). The solution is then mixed with 365 g. (5.3 moles) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 500 cc. of water and heated in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a two-holed stopper containing a bent tube of large diameter connecting with an efficient condenser (set downward for distillation) and a thermometer dipping into the liquid. The receiver should be so arranged that it can be cooled, if necessary, by a stream of water.\nThe solution is heated slowly until the first appearance of bubbles of carbon dioxide, which occurs when the temperature has reached about 80\u00b0. The flame is then removed and the reaction allowed to proceed by itself (Note 2). If no rise in temperature occurs, heat is very cautiously applied until the temperature rises to 85\u00b0, when the flame is again removed (Note 3). At this temperature the exothermic decomposition of the sodium nitroacetate becomes so rapid that the temperature rises almost to 100\u00b0 without further application of external heat. If heat is applied after the temperature of the liquid reaches 85\u00b0, violent frothing will occur, with serious loss of nitromethane. If the reaction becomes too vigorous it may be checked by applying a wet towel to the flask. Nitromethane starts to distil over at about 90\u00b0. During the spontaneous heating, about 120 cc. of nitromethane distils over, accompanied by about 170 cc. of water (Note 4). This water is saved for redistillation.\nWhen the mixture ceases to maintain its temperature spontaneously at 95\u2013100\u00b0, heat is applied cautiously until the temperature reaches 110\u00b0. About 13 cc. of nitromethane and 200 cc. of water distil over. Further distillation gives water which contains too little nitromethane to pay for recovery. At this point enough sodium chloride and sodium carbonate have separated to cause serious bumping.\nThe water separated from the nitromethane distillates is mixed with one-fourth of its weight of salt, and redistilled, yielding 10\u201312 cc. of nitromethane and about 100 cc. of water. This water on distillation gives 3\u20134 cc. of nitromethane and about 45 cc. of water (Note 5).\nThe total yield of moist product is 125\u2013135 g.; on drying with a little calcium chloride and distilling, 115\u2013125 g. of pure nitromethane, boiling at 98\u2013101\u00b0, is obtained (35\u201338 per cent of the theoretical amount). A small forerun distils over below 98\u00b0, and a little dark brown residue remains (Note 6)."

The alcohol and aldehyde are then carefully distilled off, using a fractionating column and heating in an oil or brine bath (Note 3); when the temperature of the vapors reaches 80\u00b0 fractionation is stopped and the residue is distilled in a current of steam.\nThe oil is separated from the distillate, and the aqueous portion is shaken out once with 150\u2013200 cc. of benzene.

After about one hour, crystals begin to separate; at the end of one and one-half to two hours, the mixture, which bumps considerably, is filtered rapidly by suction, and the crystals of carbanilide washed with 100 cc. of boiling water. The filtrate is chilled, and the phenylurea which crystallizes out is filtered off and rinsed with a little cold water, the washings being discarded. The filtrate is again boiled under a reflux condenser for one and one-half to two hours, or until it begins to bump, and the process is repeated. The above operations are repeated a third time, and each time the phenylurea is collected from the cold filtrate. The mother liquor is finally evaporated to one-half its original volume, and additional crops of carbanilide and phenylurea are so obtained. Further evaporation is not profitable.\nThe crude carbanilide (symmetrical diphenylurea) is practically pure, and may be obtained in large colorless needles melting at 235\u00b0 by recrystallization from alcohol with the use of decolorizing carbon; 1 l. of alcohol is required for every 25 g. of product (Note 3). The weight of the crude carbanilide is 122\u2013128 g. (38\u201340 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe crude phenylurea is somewhat colored and contains a little carbanilide. It may be purified by dissolving in a minimum quantity of boiling water, adding a little decolorizing carbon, and filtering. When the filtrate first begins to cool, a flocculent precipitate of carbanilide is deposited; this must be filtered off while the liquid is still hot. The filtrate, on cooling, yields colorless stout needles or flakes of phenylurea melting at 147\u00b0 (Note 4). The total weight of pure product is 212\u2013225 g.

            "(A) Arsonoacetic Acid.\u2014One hundred grams (0.51 mole) of powdered arsenious oxide is added to the hot solution obtained by dissolving 160 g. (4 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. After the solution has cooled to 20\u00b0, 48 g. (0.51 mole) of chloroacetic acid is added. The suspension is well stirred during about five minutes, when a strongly exothermic reaction begins, the temperature rises to 70\u201375\u00b0, and a clear solution results.\nThe reaction mixture is permitted to stand at room temperature during one hour, or longer if desired (Note 1). The solution is acidified with 160 cc. of glacial acetic acid and, after the temperature has been lowered to 40\u00b0 by cooling, the precipitated arsenious oxide is filtered off by suction and washed with 50 cc. of water.\nThe filtrate is poured into a solution containing 185 g. (0.76 mole) of crystallized barium chloride dissolved in 600 cc. of hot water. Barium arsonoacetate, Ba (O2CCH2AsO3Ba)2 (hydrated), forms a thick, finely divided precipitate. The mixture is stirred for several minutes and then allowed to stand until the following day, when it is filtered upon a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed thoroughly with water (Note 2). The yield of air-dried product is 220 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3).\nSodium arsonoacetate is prepared by adding the freshly filtered and washed barium arsonoacetate as obtained above (without drying) to a solution of 108 g. (0.76 mole) of anhydrous sodium sulfate in 500 cc. of hot water. The mixture is mechanically stirred for one hour, the barium sulfate filtered off, and the filtrate concentrated on the steam bath until crystallization commences. Upon cooling and stirring (Note 4), sodium arsonoacetate separates and is filtered by suction, the filtrate being concentrated to obtain a second crop of crystals. The yield of the combined fractions is 100\u2013110 g. (80\u201388 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Arsenoacetic Acid.\u2014A solution of 12.5 g. of sodium arsonoacetate and 30 g. of sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2 \u00b7 H2O) in 150 cc. of cold 15 per cent sulfuric acid is allowed to stand at room temperature. After two or three days, the yellow precipitate is filtered off, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum over sulfuric acid or phosphorus pentoxide. A second crop is obtained by allowing the mother liquid to stand for two days longer.\nThe arsenoacetic acid consists of minute yellow needles, which do not melt below 260\u00b0 although they undergo considerable decomposition above 200\u00b0. The yield is 5 g. (74 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "A 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a rubber stopper holding a reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer, is clamped over a steam or water bath. In the flask is placed 2.5 l. of absolute alcohol (Note 1) and then there is added gradually, through the condenser, 115 g. (5 atoms) of clean sodium cut into pieces of suitable size. If the action becomes too violent, the mixture may be cooled by water poured over the outside of the flask. The sodium ethoxide solution is stirred, and cooled to about 50\u00b0, after which 825 g. (780 cc., 5.15 moles) of diethyl malonate (Note 2) is added slowly through the separatory funnel. To the clear solution is added gradually 685 g. (535 cc., 5.0 moles) of n-butyl bromide (Note 3). The reaction commences almost immediately and considerable heat is generated. If the addition is too rapid, the reaction may become violent enough to require cooling of the flask by pouring water over it. Up to this point, the time required is about two hours.\nThe reaction mixture is refluxed until neutral to moist litmus; this requires about two hours. The flask is then connected with a condenser set for distillation. As much alcohol as possible is distilled off by means of the steam or water bath. A period of about six hours is required for this distillation, and about 2 l. of alcohol is recovered.\nThe residue from which no more alcohol can be distilled is treated with about 2 l. of water and shaken thoroughly. The upper layer of n-butylmalonic ester is separated (Note 4) and distilled under diminished pressure from a 2- or a 3-l. Claisen flask. First a low-boiling portion is collected, consisting of alcohol, water, and butyl bromide; then a small intermediate fraction of unchanged malonic ester comes over; and finally n-butylmalonic ester boiling at 140\u2013145\u00b0/40 mm., 130\u2013135\u00b0/20 mm., and 235\u2013240\u00b0/760 mm.

The beaker is rinsed out with some of the hot water. The mixture is boiled for five minutes and then filtered through filter paper in a large B\u00fcchner funnel which has been previously heated by blowing steam through it.

The mixture is heated to boiling and filtered through a large preheated B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate on cooling deposits white feathery crystals of o-chloromercuriphenol. The mixture is allowed to stand at least twelve hours and then filtered. The crystals are air-dried. They should be colorless and should melt above 147\u00b0 (m.p. of pure substance 152\u00b0). If the product is pink or melts low it should be recrystallized from hot water. The average yield of fifteen experiments was 45 g. of ortho compound melting above 147\u00b0, which corresponds to 44 per cent of the theoretical amount (Note 5)."

The hot solution is filtered and chilled to 0\u20135\u00b0 in an ice bath, and to it is added 1 l. of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath, and the mixture is stirred vigorously until the temperature falls to 0\u00b0, when the crystalline creatinine is filtered off, washed with ice-cold 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (Note 3) until the filtrate is free of chlorides, and finally with ice-cold methyl alcohol; the product (Note 4) is then dried to constant weight at 40\u201350\u00b0.

(2.7 moles) of commercial creatine hydrate and 400 g. (2.9 moles) of fused zinc chloride is heated in a porcelain dish over a small flame. The mixture melts to a viscous liquid which soon solidifies. The flame is removed when the mixture can no longer be stirred. The mass, when cold, is broken up, and stirred with 500 cc. of cold water until the lumps are softened; the crude creatinine zinc chloride is filtered off with suction on a hardened filter paper and washed with ice water to remove excess zinc chloride. The crude material is now dissolved in 6 l. of boiling 25 per cent aqueous acetic acid, filtered with the use of a little decolorizing carbon, and the solution allowed to stand for forty-eight hours. The crystals that have separated are filtered off, washed with ice water, and dried. The weight is 220\u2013230 g. The filtrate and washings are evaporated to 4.5 l. under reduced pressure in a 12-l. flask; 6.5 l. of methyl alcohol is added and the mixture allowed to stand in a cool place for twenty-four hours. The crystals that separate are filtered off, washed with cold water and dried, and an additional 150\u2013160 g. is thus obtained. The total yield is 370\u2013380 g.

The resulting mass of creatinine hydrochloride crystals is dissolved in 1 l. of water, boiled with a little decolorizing carbon, and filtered. The solution is then diluted to 4 l. with distilled water, and heated to boiling in a 12-l. flask under a reflux condenser. To the hot solution is added, with good stirring, a solution of 500 g. (2 moles) of technical picric acid (containing 10 per cent of water) in 1250 cc. of warm methyl alcohol. Stirring is continued for one hour on the steam bath and the solution allowed to cool. The crystalline precipitate of creatinine picrate is filtered off, washed well with cold water, and dried. It forms long needles which melt at 220\u00b0; the melting point (Note 6) is unchanged on recrystallization from hot water. The yield is 620\u2013630 g.

            "The moist phenylhydroxylamine obtained from 1 kg. (8.1 moles) of nitrobenzene, by the procedure described on p. 445, is weighed and dissolved in 4.5 l. of ordinary ether (Note 1). The ether-insoluble material (sodium chloride and water) is also weighed, the difference between the two weighings being a fairly accurate measure of the amount of phenylhydroxylamine in solution.\nThe ether solution is filtered through a dry filter paper into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask which is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and immersed in an ice-salt bath. When the temperature of the solution has fallen to 0\u00b0 (Note 2), a rapid stream of dry ammonia, from a cylinder of the compressed gas, is passed into the solution.\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the theoretical amount of freshly distilled n-butyl nitrite (95 g. for every 100 g. of phenylhydroxylamine) is added slowly through a dropping funnel (Note 3) and (Note 4). The addition of butyl nitrite usually requires about one hour (Note 5), during which time the stream of ammonia gas is continued in order that ammonia may always be in excess. If this precaution is not observed, a colored product will result. The temperature of the reaction mixture should be maintained below 10\u00b0 and this may be done best by controlling the rate at which the butyl nitrite is added (Note 6). An appreciable rise in temperature will cause the volatilization of considerable quantities of ether and of ammonia (Note 7).\nAfter the butyl nitrite has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred for about ten minutes longer in order to insure completion of the reaction, after which the cupferron is filtered off and washed several times with small portions of fresh ether. The product is spread on sheets of paper until all traces of ether have been lost, and is then stored in bottles where it is exposed to the vapors of ammonium carbonate. This may be done by protecting each cork with a double sheet of filter paper and placing a lump of ammonium carbonate between the cork and the filter paper (Note 8).\nThe yield of cupferron based on a given weight of phenylhydroxylamine averages 85\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount."

The flask and its contents are tared and cooled to 10\u00b0 before the absorption of acetylene is begun. The gas from the tank, A, is washed free from acetone by being passed first through water in the gasometer, B, and then through the concentrated sulfuric acid wash bottle, C.\nFig. 11.\nThe acetylene is absorbed rapidly, with the evolution of considerable heat. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0 by immersing the flask in a freezing mixture. When at intervals the reaction slows down, it becomes necessary to sweep the system free from air which accumulates in the flask. The absorption is continued until about 60 g. (2.3 moles) of acetylene has been absorbed, which requires a period of about two hours (Note 2). During the absorption, the mixture turns first a reddish brown, then a dark brown, and finally almost black.\nThe reaction mixture is freed from the acid by washing once with pure water and then with sodium carbonate solution, to which some sodium chloride is added to aid the separation of the hydrocarbon layer. If emulsification takes place, the addition of ether will remedy the difficulty.\nThe toluene layer is transferred to a 1-l. flask, without drying, and the unchanged toluene distilled off; the ditolylethane is then collected over a range of 295\u2013310\u00b0. There is practically no intermediate fraction, but a tarry residue of about 75 g. remains in the flask. Upon redistillation, the ditolylethane is collected at 295\u2013300\u00b0. The yield is 290\u2013310 g. (60\u201364 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3) and (Note 4)."

        "Procedure": [
            "(A) Apparatus.1\u2014The apparatus is assembled according to Fig. 15. A is a 500-cc. Pyrex filter flask. B is a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask; into one of the side necks is fitted a 300-cc. dropping funnel C\nFig. 15.\n(Note 1), and the second side neck is closed with a loose-fitting, well-greased rubber stopper, which serves as a safety valve against any sudden increase of pressure in the generator. A long (75-cm.) water-cooled bulb condenser D is connected to the middle neck of the generator flask B. The large-bore glass tube E connects the top of the condenser D with trap F, a 500-cc. filter flask, which is connected by means of a short rubber tube to the drying towers G and H (Note 2). These towers are conveniently made from glass condenser jackets; the bottom ends are sealed and the top ends closed with rubber stoppers (Note 3). Tower H is connected to \"sight flask\"; I, a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask. This in turn is connected to the absorption vessels J and K (500-cc. gas washing bottles), which are immersed in an ice-salt bath contained in dish L. Absorption bottle K is connected to \"sight flask\" M, a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask similar to I. By means of the sight flasks I and M the efficiency of absorption can be judged by the depth of color. Flask I also serves to catch any liquid sucked back from the absorption vessels.\nBefore finally assembling the apparatus, the various units are charged as follows: A is one-third filled with water to serve as a bubble counter. Generator B is about one-quarter filled with dry arsenious oxide, pea size or powdered. Drying towers G and H are filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. (It is well to place a wad of glass wool in front of the entrance and exit tubes.) In each of the two absorption bottles, J and K, is placed 200 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl malonate. Dish L is filled with an ice-salt freezing mixture.\nWhen assembled as indicated, the apparatus is ready for operation. Concentrated nitric acid is run, in small portions, into generator B from dropping funnel C. After the action has started, the nitric acid must be forced into flask B by applying a small air pressure at the top of dropping funnel C and then opening the stopcock. Later on, when the gas generation slackens, flask B is heated with a smoky flame. The evolution of gas is maintained at a steady rate by increasing the heat until finally all the arsenious oxide has dissolved and the frothing has ceased. During the whole operation a slow stream of compressed air (Note 4) is passed through the apparatus from \"bubble counter\" A. The stream of air is insufficient if any colorless gas, which turns brown on coming in contact with the air, leaves the apparatus at M. When the arsenious oxide is exhausted, as shown by a slackening in gas evolution, the old generator is removed and a fresh one put in its place. (If the generator is first allowed to cool somewhat, this change can be accomplished without much discomfort.) The moist oxides of nitrogen, in passing up through the condenser D, lose most of their moisture and the gas on passing down through tube E should deposit very little water in trap F. The gas is then thoroughly dried in the towers G and H. When the calcium chloride in G becomes wet (after several runs) the tower is refilled; at the same time G and H are interchanged. After passing through the drying towers and through flask I, the gas is absorbed by the cold ethyl malonate in vessels J and K (Note 5).\n(B) Ethyl Oxomalonate.\u2014A rapid stream of nitrous anhydride is passed into the cold ethyl malonate, which becomes dark green in color. There should be an increase in weight of about 200 g. in absorption bottle J in two to three hours (Note 6).\nThe liquid is left in the freezing mixture for several hours, then gradually allowed to come to room temperature (Note 7). Red gases are slowly evolved. After standing for two days or more at room temperature, the liquid is transferred to a distilling flask provided with a capillary air intake, and the delivery tube connected with a water-cooled condenser and receiver. The distillation is performed under reduced pressure, by the use of a water pump. Considerable nitric oxide is evolved before the pressure drops to about 70 mm. (Note 8).\nThe first fraction consists mainly of water, a little ethyl acetate, and some ethyl oxomalonate which recombines with the water to form ethyl mesoxalate. When the pressure has dropped to 45 mm. and the temperature has risen to 110\u00b0, the receiver is changed (Note 9). The main product, ethyl oxomalonate, now distils at 110\u2013135\u00b0/45\u201350 mm. If the oxidation has been complete, very little residue is left (Note 10). Redistillation gives a golden-yellow liquid boiling between 103\u2013108\u00b0/15 mm. The yield is 160\u2013165 g. (74\u201376 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

When all the sodium is in solution, the flask is cooled and 800 g. (754 cc., 5 moles) of diethyl malonate added through the condenser, with stirring. The mixture is warmed gently on the steam bath and 700 g. (658 cc., 4.1 moles) of diethyl fumarate (Note 1) added from the dropping funnel. During this addition the solution is kept boiling gently, heat being applied if necessary (Note 2). The mixture is boiled for one hour after the diethyl fumarate has been added. It is then cooled and 250 g. (238 cc., 4.2 moles) of glacial acetic acid is added.\nMost of the alcohol is distilled off under slightly reduced pressure on the steam bath and the residue is poured into sufficient distilled water to dissolve all the solid. The water layer is separated and extracted four times with carbon tetrachloride, which is added to the ester layer. The ester-carbon tetrachloride mixture is washed twice with water and the water washings extracted once with carbon tetrachloride. The carbon tetrachloride is distilled off under atmospheric pressure through a column, the moisture being carried over simultaneously.\nThe residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, when the ethyl propane-1,1,2,3-tetracarboxylate comes over at 182\u2013184\u00b0/8 mm.

            "(A) Alcoholysis of Methyleneaminoacetonitrile.\u2014To a solution of 51.5 g. (28 cc., 0.5 mole) of 95 per cent sulfuric acid in 125 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol at 45\u201350\u00b0, contained in a wide-mouthed 250-cc. conical flask, is added 34 g. (0.5 mole) of methyleneaminoacetonitrile (p. 355) (Note 1). The flask is closed with a rubber stopper (Note 2) and vigorously shaken by hand. Solution takes place with evolution of heat, the temperature rising about 10\u201315\u00b0 (Note 3). The liquid separates into two layers, the upper one consisting of methylene diethyl ether; crystallization of the aminoacetonitrile hydrogen sulfate sets in rapidly. The mixture is shaken vigorously at intervals to prevent the formation of a hard cake of crystals. After the mass has stood overnight in the refrigerator at 0\u20135\u00b0, the salt is filtered off and washed with a minimum quantity (20\u201325 cc.) of ice-cold alcohol. The yield is 57\u201362 g. (75\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4).\n(B) Preparation of Glycine.\u2014To a boiling suspension of 253 g. (0.8 mole) of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 500 cc. of water in a 1-l. beaker is added, in portions, 61.6 g. (0.4 mole) of aminoacetonitrile hydrogen sulfate at such a rate that the mixture does not froth over. The beaker is then covered with a 1-l. round-bottomed flask containing cold running water, and boiling is continued until no more ammonia is evolved. This requires six to eight hours. The barium is then quantitatively precipitated by the addition of exactly the necessary amount of 50 per cent sulfuric acid (Note 5). The filtrate is concentrated on a water bath to a volume of 50\u201375 cc.; on chilling, crude glycine crystallizes and is filtered off. The filtrate is again concentrated and chilled and the crystals removed. This process is continued until the final filtrate amounts to about 5 cc. The yield of crude glycine so obtained amounts to 25\u201327 g. This is systematically recrystallized from water, decolorizing with Norite and collecting the material which melts (with decomposition) at 246\u00b0 (corr.) or above. Washing of the successive crops with 50 per cent ethyl alcohol is of great assistance in freeing the crystals of mother liquor. The yield of pure glycine is 20\u201326 g. (67\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount).",
            "In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 8 l. (120 moles) of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and to it is gradually added, with stirring, 189 g. (2 moles) of monochloroacetic acid. The solution is stirred until the chloroacetic acid is dissolved and is then set aside for about forty-eight hours at room temperature. The solution, which is colorless or faintly yellow, is concentrated on a water bath under reduced pressure (Note 1) to a volume of about 200 cc.\nThe concentrated solution of glycine and ammonium chloride is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, the flask is rinsed with a little water, and this is added to the main portion. The volume of the solution is finally brought to 250 cc. with water, and the glycine is precipitated by the gradual addition of 1500 cc. of methyl alcohol (Note 2). The solution is well stirred during the addition of the methyl alcohol and is cooled in an ice box for four to six hours to allow complete crystallization. The solution is filtered, and the glycine crystals are washed by suspending them in 500 cc. of 95 per cent methyl alcohol; they are again collected on the filter and washed with a little methyl alcohol and then with ether. After air drying the yield is 108\u2013112 g. of glycine.\nThis product contains small amounts of chloride and ammonia. For purification it is dissolved in 200 to 215 cc. of water with warming. This solution is shaken with 10 g. of permutit (Note 3) and filtered. The glycine is then precipitated by the addition of approximately five volumes (about 1250 cc.) of methyl alcohol. The glycine is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with methyl alcohol and ether, and dried in the air. The yield is 96\u201398 g. (64\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which darkens at 237\u00b0 and melts at 240\u00b0 with decomposition. It gives no test for chlorides and is free from ammonium salts as indicated by the test with Nessler's reagent."

(0.55 mole) of quinone (Note 1) is added gradually in small portions with constant mechanical stirring. The temperature rises and should be held at 40\u201350\u00b0 during the addition of the quinone. A temperature higher than 50\u00b0 leads to decomposition of the product whereas a temperature lower than 40\u00b0 causes a much slower reaction. Good temperature control can be obtained by using care in adding the quinone and by the use of a cooling bath and efficient stirring. The reaction goes smoothly and does not evolve an excessive amount of heat.\nAfter all the quinone has been added, the solution is allowed to stand. It should be watched closely at first to see that the temperature does not rise above 50\u00b0, but at the same time it is well not to cool it below 40\u00b0. When the mixture starts to cool of its own accord, a precipitate begins to form. As soon as the mixture has cooled to about 25\u00b0 (Note 2), it is poured into 750 cc. of cold water, whereupon a white precipitate separates. The mixture is cooled to about 10\u00b0 and filtered with suction. The product is recrystallized from 250 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and dried. The drying is best done in a vacuum desiccator, through which a very small stream of air is allowed to sweep. Calcium chloride is the best drying agent.\nThe product is practically white and rather granular; it melts at 96\u201397\u00b0. The yield is 120\u2013123 g. (86\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is fairly reactive and tends to decompose upon standing (Note 3), especially if care is not used in drying and handling.

            "(A) Preparation of Ketene.\u2014The arrangement of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 19 (Note 1). The graduated separatory funnel, shown in the diagram, filled with 100 g. (126 cc., 1.7 moles) of commercial acetone, leads into a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask which, in turn, is connected by gas-tight joints (Note 2) to a glass combustion tube filled with broken porcelain, a spiral or bulb condenser, a three-way stopcock, and a reaction flask. In the reaction flask is placed the material with which the ketene is to react (Note 3). A second reaction flask may be placed in series, if desired, to ascertain if any ketene escaped reaction in the first flask.\nFig. 19.\nPrior to either of these steps, fourteen of the twenty burners of the combustion furnace are lighted (Note 4) and tiles are placed over the lighted burners, which finally must be adjusted to yield a maximum temperature. The first two and last four burners are unused.\nWhen the furnace is fully heated, boiling water is placed beneath the round-bottomed flask and cold water passed through the condenser. Acetone is now dropped in at the rate of 3\u20134 cc. per minute. About one-half the acetone should be recovered as distillate in cylinder B (Note 5). Ketene, admixed with methane, carbon monoxide, and ethylene, passes into the reaction flasks (Note 6) in 25\u201329 per cent yields of the theoretical amount. The flow may be interrupted at will by checking the acetone flow (Note 7).\n(B) Preparation of Acetanilide.\u2014Since ketene is a highly reactive gas, it is usually prepared for immediate consumption instead of being isolated as such. It reacts with various groups which contain hydrogen, such as hydroxyl, amino, mercaptan, hydroxylamino, etc., forming acetyl derivatives.\nTwenty-five grams (0.27 mole) of aniline is placed in the reaction flask, D, and 50 cc. of dry ether added as solvent (Note 8). A second reaction flask is connected at C, in which is placed 5 g. of aniline, dissolved in 20 cc. of dry ether. This prevents the escape of ketene vapor at the beginning and at the close of the operation (Note 5). In all, 85 cc. of acetone is passed through the apparatus, 39 cc. of which is recovered as distillate. Therefore, 44 cc. (or 35 g.) of acetone is decomposed. The duration of the run is about thirty minutes. Twenty-one grams of acetanilide, which corresponds to a yield of 25.8 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the amount of acetone decomposed, is isolated from the reaction mixture (Note 9)."

A flannel cloth is used in the filter, or a filtros plate may be cemented into a B\u00fcchner funnel with water-glass. The precipitate is washed well with hot water, after which it is returned to the beaker and digested as before with hot water to which is added a slight excess of ammonia, beyond that required to neutralize any acid present.\nThe product is filtered and dried to constant weight. The filtrate will be clear and will give no precipitate with hydrochloric acid if the conditions of condensation have been correct.\nThe \u03b2-methylanthraquinone is pale tan in color and weighs from 118 to 130 g.

This requires several minutes of stirring. To this mixture is added 450 cc. of 75 per cent sulfuric acid (Note 2).

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 4 kg. (2816 cc.) of c.p. concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) (Note 1). To this is added, in 25-cc. portions, 210 g. (1.23 moles) of nicotine (Note 2). The addition should be made carefully in order that local heating may not occur and material be lost. After each addition of nicotine, the flask should be shaken in order to insure a homogeneous solution. The addition of the nicotine causes the temperature of the liquid to rise somewhat but not sufficiently to cause evolution of nitrogen dioxide. The flask is placed on a steam bath under a hood and heated until the liquid reaches a temperature of 70\u00b0. It is then removed and the reaction allowed to continue spontaneously (Note 3), sufficient heat being evolved to cause the liquid to boil. The boiling ceases after one hour, but the flask is replaced upon the steam bath for ten to twelve hours, during which time there is a more or less continuous evolution of oxides of nitrogen.\nThe contents of the flask are then poured into an evaporating dish and evaporated almost to dryness on the steam bath (about ten hours). The purification which follows is best carried out with the product of two runs such as have been described above.\nAfter the evaporation of most of the liquid, the nicotinic acid nitrate from two runs is transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker, 400 cc. of distilled water is added (Note 4), and the mixture is heated until complete solution results. On cooling, the nicotinic acid nitrate separates as yellow granular crystals and is filtered off. To obtain it absolutely pure, it may be recrystallized in a way similar to that just described but with the use of animal charcoal. It contains one molecule of water of crystallization and has a melting point of 190\u2013192\u00b0 (corr.). The yield is 420\u2013460 g. 83\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe 420\u2013460 g. of crude nicotinic acid nitrate from two runs (not necessarily dry) is dissolved in 900 cc. of boiling water in a 3-l. beaker, and 800 g. of crystalline disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4 \u00b7 12H2O) is added with constant stirring. The resulting thick mixture is stirred and heated almost to boiling for five minutes and then allowed to cool. The mixture is finally chilled to 0\u00b0 by an ice bath. It is well to stir occasionally during the crystallization to prevent the formation of too solid a cake of crystalline material. The nicotinic acid is filtered off upon a 15-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold water.\nThe yield is 260\u2013300 g. of material containing a small amount of mineral salts but otherwise nearly pure. It can be purified further by recrystallization from 2.5 to 3.5 l. (Note 4) of hot water, 150\u2013180 g. of material, which melts at 230\u2013232\u00b0 (corr.), being obtained. The yield of recrystallized material is 50\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the nicotine employed.\nThe recrystallization is the least satisfactory part of this procedure and involves the greatest apparent loss of material; the product before recrystallization is sufficiently pure for most purposes. By evaporation of the mother liquors, 40\u201345 g. of pure nicotinic acid may be obtained, making the total yield of pure material 190\u2013225 g. (63\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount); in addition, a small amount of somewhat less pure material is recovered (Note 5)."

The rate of addition is so adjusted that the temperature rises to 50\u00b0 in thirty minutes, and during the subsequent additions the temperature of the mixture is not allowed to exceed 55\u00b0. The mixture takes on a slightly yellow color. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for three hours, the mixture is filtered by gravity, and the yellow filtrate is acidified with just enough dilute hydrochloric acid to give an acid reaction to litmus. Subsequent to the addition of 30 g. of Norite and stirring for five minutes, the solution is again filtered.\nThe filtrate, which should be colorless, is concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure (Fig. 23) (Note 3) until crystalline material begins to separate. The liquor, amounting to approximately 3 l., is heated on the steam bath at atmospheric pressure and filtered with suction while hot, any crystals remaining on the filter being washed through by aspiration of wet steam. The filtrate is allowed to stand in the refrigerator overnight and the first crop of crystals filtered off. This weighs approximately 300 g. and melts at about 237\u00b0 (corr.). The mother liquor is concentrated to approximately 2 l. and a second crop obtained as above; this weighs 60\u201370 g. and melts at 242\u00b0 (corr.). A third crop of 50\u201360 g. melting at 249\u00b0 (corr.) is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor to 1.2 l. The mother liquor is finally concentrated to a sirup, when a fourth crop weighing about 10 g. and melting at 248\u00b0 (corr.) is obtained.\nThe combined product, weighing 410-420 g., is recrystallized from an equal weight of hot water containing 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The color is removed by the addition of 5 g. of Norite. By suitably concentrating the mother liquors, second, third, and fourth crops may be obtained, all of which appear to be of the same purity as the first crop. The total yield is 360\u2013370 g.

(230 cc., 2 moles) of freshly distilled benzyl chloride in 1 l. of dry ether. If the reaction does not start at once, the flask is partially immersed in a bath containing water heated to about 40\u00b0. As soon as the ether begins to boil, and reaction sets in, the bath is removed and stirring is commenced. The remainder of the benzyl chloride in ether can be added during the course of one-half hour if the reaction is regulated by cooling the greater part of the flask by immersion in ice water (Note 2). The reaction will continue for about fifteen minutes after all the benzyl chloride has been added, and then the mixture is refluxed gently for about fifteen minutes.\nTo the stirred benzylmagnesium chloride is then added 616 g. (522 cc., 4 moles) of freshly distilled diethyl sulfate (Note 3). The addition of diethyl sulfate is so regulated that gentle refluxing takes place throughout the reaction. Once reaction is started with a few cubic centimeters of diethyl sulfate, it is necessary to cool the reaction flask by ice water in order to complete addition within about one hour. When all the ester has been added, stirring is continued with gentle boiling for fifteen minutes (Note 4).\nThe cooled mixture is next poured, with stirring, upon a mixture of 1 kg. of crushed ice, 1 l. of water, and 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After stirring a few minutes to dissolve the sludge, the major part of the water layer is siphoned off and the ethereal solution is separated. The water layer is washed once with about 50 cc. of ether, and this washing is added to the ethereal solution of n-propylbenzene. The ether is removed by distillation from a water or steam bath through a fractionating column. The residue is poured into 1 l. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution in about 50 per cent alcohol, and this mixture is refluxed for one hour (Note 5). After the n-propylbenzene is thrown out by the addition of a large volume of water, the hydrocarbon is separated, combined with an ether extract of the aqueous layer, dried by standing over 10\u201315 g. of solid potassium hydroxide, and fractionally distilled through an efficient column. The yield of n-propylbenzene, distilling at 155\u2013160\u00b0, is 165\u2013180 g. (70\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

(3.2 moles) of phenol in a 1-l. round-bottomed, three-necked Pyrex flask provided with an efficient stirrer, a thermometer, and a connection with a downward condenser. The flask is set in an oil bath which is heated at once to 155\u2013160\u00b0, and the stirrer is run at a rate high enough to insure thorough mixing.\nWhen the inside temperature reaches 140\u00b0, boiling commences and water with a very little phenol begins to distil. The distillation is allowed to continue until 60 cc. (one molecular equivalent) of water has been collected; this usually requires one hour, and the inside temperature rises to 146\u00b0. The downward condenser is then replaced by a reflux condenser (Note 1) and the reaction is allowed to continue until a total of four hours has elapsed from the time the contents of the flask first reached 140\u00b0. After the return condenser has been attached, the inside temperature declines slowly to 141\u00b0 or 142\u00b0 and the reaction mixture becomes thicker and somewhat tarry. After the contents of the flask have been partially cooled, they are poured into 4 l. of water and mechanically stirred; the agitation is continued for a short time in order to break up the tarry material and enable the water to dissolve the hydroxyphenylarsonic acids completely.\nFinely ground barium hydroxide is added gradually to the well-stirred water solution until the material is slightly alkaline to litmus, in order to remove the excess of arsenic acid; when this point is reached, the solution becomes pink. If the procedure is carried out properly, 700\u2013800 g. of Ba(OH)2\u00b78H2O should suffice (Note 2). The time required by this method is greater than when a hot solution of barium hydroxide is used, but the method is more convenient and does not cause such a great increase in volume. After removal of the barium arsenate by filtration, the mother liquor and washings are treated with sulfuric acid until the solution contains neither barium nor sulfate ions. When the barium sulfate has been separated and thoroughly washed (Note 3), the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to about 3 l., neutralized to litmus with sodium hydroxide, filtered, evaporated until the solution becomes well coated with crystals, and then treated with 2.5 volumes of alcohol. After the mixture has cooled in an ice box, the sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is separated, washed with alcohol, and dried in an oven at 80\u00b0. A second crop may be secured from the filtrate by concentrating it further and precipitating with alcohol. The total yield of anhydrous sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is 252 g. (33 per cent of the theoretical amount). By proper manipulation, it is possible to obtain as much as 240 g. in the first crop and to have it free from sulfate, arsenate, and sodium o-hydroxyphenylarsonate which is one of the by-products formed in this reaction (Note 4)."

            "(A) Preparation of Cuprous Cyanide Solution.\u2014Cuprous chloride prepared from 1250 g. (5 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate, according to the directions given on p. 170, is suspended in 2 l. of cold water in a 15-l. crock fitted with a mechanical stirrer. A solution of 650 g. (12.7\u201313 moles) of sodium cyanide (96\u201398 per cent) in 1 l. of water is added and the mixture stirred, whereupon the cuprous chloride enters into solution with considerable evolution of heat (Note 1). The mixture is then cooled by surrounding the crock with cold water (Note 2).\n(B) o-Tolunitrile.\u2014While the cuprous cyanide solution is cooling, 428 g. (427 cc., 4 moles) of o-toluidine is mixed in a 20-l. crock with 1 l. of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and enough cracked ice, about 4 kg., to bring the temperature of the mixture to 0\u00b0. A solution of 280 g. (4.06 moles) of sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water is added, with stirring, to the resulting suspension of o-toluidine hydrochloride, the temperature being kept at 0\u20135\u00b0 by the addition of cracked ice. The addition of the nitrite occupies about fifteen minutes; at the end of the operation, the mixture must show a distinct and permanent reaction for free nitrous acid on testing with starch-iodide paper (Note 3). The final volume of the solution is 5\u20136 l. The mixture is now cautiously neutralized by adding dry sodium carbonate with constant stirring, using litmus paper to determine the end-point; about 200 g. of the anhydrous carbonate is required (Note 4).\nThe cold cuprous cyanide solution is now chilled to 0\u20135\u00b0 by the addition of ice, and 1 l. of benzene (Note 5) is poured on the surface. To this mixture is slowly added the cold neutralized diazonium solution. During the addition, which occupies about thirty minutes, such vigorous stirring is maintained that the benzene on the surface is constantly drawn to the stirrer, and the temperature is maintained at 0\u20135\u00b0 by occasionally adding ice. As soon as the diazonium solution comes into contact with the cuprous cyanide, a dark yellow, oily precipitate is formed which at once begins to give off nitrogen; the resulting nitrile is taken up by the benzene as soon as it is formed (Note 6). When all has been added, the temperature is held at 0\u20135\u00b0 for thirty minutes longer, and then is allowed to rise to that of the room (20\u201325\u00b0), which usually requires about three hours.\nAfter stirring has been continued for two hours longer, the crock is surrounded by hot water or steam and warmed to 50\u00b0 without stirring. The mixture is then allowed to stand until cool, when the aqueous layer is drawn off by means of a siphon. The upper oily layer is transferred to a 12-l. flask and distilled in a current of steam until no more oil passes over; about 10 l. of distillate is collected (Note 7). The water is drawn off and the benzene removed by distillation, by means of a 2-l. round-bottomed flask and a fractionating column about 90 cm. long. When benzene no longer distils over, the distillation is continued in the same apparatus under reduced pressure, and the fraction that boils at 94\u201396\u00b0/20 mm. is collected. A small amount of dark-colored residue remains in the flask. The yield of almost colorless o-tolunitrile is 300\u2013330 g. (64\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(C) p-Tolunitrile.\u2014p-Tolunitrile can be prepared in exactly the same manner from p-toluidine; the product, which distils at 104\u2013106\u00b0/20 mm., solidifies in the receiver to a mass of nearly colorless needles which melt at 25\u201327\u00b0. The yield is the same as with the ortho compound (Note 8)."

            "A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is clamped to a ring stand and equipped with a rubber stopper carrying a glass stirrer with mercury seal, and a reflux condenser connected with a trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97) for removing the evolved hydrogen chloride.\nOne hundred grams (0.68 mole) of phthalic anhydride and 400 g. (462 cc., 4.35 moles) of toluene are placed in the flask, which is cooled in an ice bath while 200 g. (1.5 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 1) is being ground to a fine powder. The chloride is now added all at once (Note 2). Stirring is commenced at once, and the ice bath is removed. The mixture warms up considerably and becomes olive-green in color. When the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins to slacken (ten minutes) a water bath is put into place and heated to 90\u00b0 in the course of forty-five minutes. The temperature of the bath is kept at 90\u00b0 and vigorous stirring continued for two and one-half hours. At this point, the evolution of hydrogen chloride will have practically ceased and the reaction will have been completed. The hot water in the bath is replaced first by cold water and then by ice, while stirring is continued.\nAs soon as the flask is well cooled, it is disconnected and carried to the hood, and ice is slowly added, with shaking, until the dark mass is completely decomposed and the flask is about one-half filled with the mixture. After 150 cc. of crude concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added, the mass coagulates and the solution clears; the flask is then heated on the steam bath while preparations are being made for steam distillation.\nThis operation, which removes the excess of toluene, may be carried out in the same flask and loss by transfer thus avoided (Note 3). The aqueous solution of aluminum chloride and hydrochloric acid, after thorough cooling, is decanted through a suction filter, the residue washed with a little cold water, and that collected on the filter returned to the flask. This residue consists almost solely of p-toluyl-o-benzoic acid, partly crystalline, partly in oily lumps.\nA previously prepared and heated solution of 50 g. of sodium carbonate in 1 l. of water is added, and steam is passed in to provide heat and agitation. With a rapid stream, the acid will go into solution in about ten minutes, leaving a small amount of brown, tarry material and a little alumina undissolved (Note 4). The solution is filtered while hot and transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and the acid precipitated by the addition of 65 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The acid separates as an oil, which soon crystallizes. The solution is cooled in ice and the acid filtered and washed.\nThe air-dried product is pure white and weighs 170 g. (Note 5). After drying at 100\u00b0, the anhydrous acid melts at 138\u2013139\u00b0 and weighs 157 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount). Air-dried material is suitable for the condensation to \u03b2-methylanthraquinone, p. 353. It may be recrystallized from toluene."

A receiver with a side tube is attached to the condenser; this side tube leads to a water trap. The mixture is boiled, with continual stirring, at such a rate that the alcohol is removed as fast as it is formed, but without undue removal of water from the flask (Note 1). The progress of the reaction can be followed by noting the rate at which carbon dioxide passes through the trap. When the temperature at the head of the column approaches 100\u00b0, the flame is turned down so that very little liquid distils over. Heating is continued until evolution of carbon dioxide ceases (Note 2).\nThe flask is now disconnected from the stirrer and column, and the contents distilled off as completely as possible on the steam bath under reduced pressure. The remaining solid is freed from residual moisture and hydrochloric acid by allowing a slow current of dry air to pass over it, while still heating on the steam bath and maintaining a partial vacuum (Note 3). It is then redissolved in distilled water; the solution is filtered with the use of decolorizing carbon, and again evaporated under reduced pressure.\nThe residue, when completely dry, is ground up, mixed to a paste with dry ether, filtered by suction, washed with dry ether, and dried.

This decomposition of the excess chlorosulfonic acid should be carried out in the hood. The solid sulfonyl chloride which separates is collected on a suction funnel (Note 4) and washed with water. The yield of crude material is 90\u201395 g. (77\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the acetanilide).\nThis crude material may be used directly in many preparations such as p-acetaminobenzenesulfinic acid (p. 7). If a pure product is desired, the crude material is dried by pressing on a porous plate and then crystallized from dry benzene. The acid chloride is slightly soluble in benzene, and only 1.5 to 2 g. will dissolve in 100 cc. of hot benzene. On cooling, about 75 per cent of the material separates from the benzene in thick, colorless prisms melting at 149\u00b0 (Note 5)."

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask (Note 1), fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed 3 kg. (1555 cc.) of fuming sulfuric acid (20 per cent of free sulfur trioxide). Then the flask is cooled very efficiently with a thick pack of ice and salt, until the temperature of the acid reaches \u22125\u00b0 (Note 2). The stirring is started, and 700 g. (3.64 moles) of finely powdered u. s. p. citric acid is added gradually. The speed of the addition is regulated according to the temperature of the reaction mixture. The temperature should not rise above 0\u00b0 until half of the citric acid has been added, after which the temperature should not be allowed to exceed 10\u00b0 until the reaction is complete. The addition requires three to four hours, provided efficient cooling is used. The citric acid should be in solution at the end of this time; if not, the stirring should be continued until it has dissolved completely.\nThe temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to rise gradually until a vigorous evolution of gas commences; at this point the flask is cooled with ice water to stop the excessive frothing, but cooling is not carried far enough to stop the evolution of gas entirely (Note 3). After the more vigorous foaming has ceased, the reaction mixture is raised to about 30\u00b0 and kept there until no more foaming occurs. A convenient way of determining this point is to stop the stirring for a moment and allow the mixture to remain quiet. After a minute or so, a clear brown liquid giving off very few gas bubbles should result. This general procedure requires two to three hours.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled down again with ice and salt until the temperature reaches 0\u00b0, then 2400 g. of finely cracked ice is added in small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10\u00b0 until one-third of the ice has been added. Then the temperature may be allowed to rise to 25\u201330\u00b0. The addition of the ice requires about two hours; after this, the mixture is cooled again to 0\u00b0 (Note 4) and then filtered as rapidly as possible through a funnel fitted with a filtros plate (Note 5). The crystals are thoroughly pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The acetonedicarboxylic acid is light gray to white in color. After the suction and pressing have removed practically all of the sulfuric acid, the crystals are transferred to a beaker and stirred with sufficient ethyl acetate (about 200\u2013250 cc.) to make a thick paste. The crystals are filtered with suction. If acetonedicarboxylic acid entirely free from sulfuric acid is desired, the washing with ethyl acetate should be repeated. The yield of practically dry acetonedicarboxylic acid varies from 450\u2013475 g. (85\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6). This may be used directly for the preparation of the ester (p. 237). The acid itself is not stable and after a few hours gradually decomposes (Note 7)."

(5 moles) of cyclohexanol (Note 2) is introduced slowly through the separatory funnel. At first 40\u201350 drops of cyclohexanol are admitted and the reaction mixture is stirred until the reaction has started (four to five minutes) as is indicated by the evolution of oxides of nitrogen (Note 3). Then the reaction flask is placed in an ice-water bath and cooled until the temperature of the oxidizing mixture is 55\u201360\u00b0. The cyclohexanol is then added as rapidly as possible while the temperature of the mixture is kept within these limits. Toward the end of the oxidation (after about 475 g. of cyclohexanol has been added) the ice bath must be removed and sometimes heat must be applied in order to maintain the temperature and avoid crystallization of adipic acid.\nStirring is continued for about one hour after the addition of the last of the cyclohexanol. Then the mixture is cooled to about 0\u00b0 and the adipic acid is collected on a suction filter, washed with 500 cc. of ice water, and dried in the air overnight. The yield is 395\u2013410 g. of white crystals which melt at 146\u2013149\u00b0.

(2.5 moles) of bromobenzene in 1-l. of dry carbon disulfide (Note 1). To this is added 750 g. (5.6 moles) (Note 2) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The mixture is heated on a steam bath until gentle refluxing starts, and then 204 g. (2 moles) of acetic anhydride (Note 3) is added slowly through the dropping funnel. The time of addition is about one hour. Gentle refluxing should be continued throughout the time of addition of the anhydride and for one hour afterward. The reaction is accompanied by a copious evolution of hydrogen chloride which does not entirely cease even after this subsequent heating.\nA condenser is attached to one of the side necks, and the carbon disulfide is distilled without removing the flask from the steam bath. After the removal of the solvent (Note 4), the reaction mixture is allowed to cool somewhat (Note 5); but while it is still warm, it is poured slowly with stirring over cracked ice to which hydrochloric acid has been added. In this way only a small amount of the aluminum chloride addition product remains in the flask. This is decomposed with ice and hydrochloric acid and added to the main product. The volume is now about 5 l. Each 2-l. portion is extracted twice with 300-cc. and 200-cc. portions of benzene or ether. The extracts are combined and washed twice with water, once with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and twice more with water. The final water washings should be practically colorless and the separation sharp, any precipitate being allowed to separate with the water.\nThe extract is dried for one hour with about 30 g. of calcium chloride and filtered, and the solvent is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure with a short column (p. 130). Some low-boiling material comes over first, and then the temperature rises rapidly. If care has been taken in the water decomposition to remove all the aluminum salts (Note 6), the product comes over water-white and crystallizes to a white solid melting at 49\u201350.5\u00b0.

            "To a solution of 25 g. of mercuric chloride in 500 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask, 800 g. of cracked ice is added. A cold solution of 190 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water is added, and a rapid stream of chlorine is passed into the mixture, which must be kept below 5\u00b0. The addition of chlorine is continued in this way until the yellow precipitate of mercuric oxide just disappears. Then 1600 cc. of cold nitric acid (1.5 N) is added slowly, with stirring.\nThe concentration of the hypochlorous acid solution is determined by adding a measured volume to an excess of potassium iodide solution acidified with hydrochloric acid, and titrating with standard thiosulfate solution. Usually the concentration is found to be between 3.5 and 4 per cent. The amount necessary to react with 123 g. (1.5 moles) of cyclohexene is calculated.\nIn a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a good mechanical stirrer (Note 1) is placed 123 g. (1.5 moles) of cyclohexene (p. 183), and to it is added about one-fourth the calculated amount of the hypochlorous acid solution. The mixture is kept between 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0, and stirred vigorously until a 1-cc. test portion gives no yellow color when it is treated with potassium iodide solution and dilute hydrochloric acid. When the first portion of the hypochlorous acid has reacted, a second is added and the process is repeated. When all the hypochlorous acid has been added and the reaction is complete, the oily layer should be on the bottom and a very slight excess of hypochlorous acid should be present, as indicated by the potassium iodide test. If these conditions are not fulfilled, 100-cc. portions of the hypochlorous acid solution are added until the reaction is shown to be complete.\nThe solution is now saturated with salt and distilled with steam (Note 2). About 2 l. of distillate is required before all of the 2-chlorocyclohexanol passes over. The distillate is saturated with salt and the oily layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted once with about 250 cc. of ether. This is added to the main portion, which is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation and the product distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 88\u201390\u00b0/20 mm. (104\u2013106\u00b0/45 mm.) is collected.

This washing removes the natural oils from the hair (Note 4). Two kilos of the dry, washed hair is pushed into a 12-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask, and 4 l. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid (Note 5) is added. An air-cooled reflux condenser, consisting of a wide glass tube, is attached to the flask. The hair is hydrolyzed by heating on the steam bath (Note 6) until the biuret reaction is entirely negative; this requires one hundred twenty to one hundred forty-four hours.\nThe mixture is filtered hot, and the insoluble residue is washed with distilled water. The total filtrate is now partially neutralized with 300 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, while the mixture is well stirred and cooled, and then a saturated solution of 3750 g. of crystallized sodium acetate is added. The Congo red test for mineral acid should then be entirely negative. Care must be taken not to make the solution alkaline with sodium hydroxide (Note 7). After standing for three days at room temperature, the precipitated cystine is filtered on a suction funnel. This crude material, containing, in addition to the cystine, some \"humin\" pigments and tyrosine, is dissolved in 3 l. of 3 per cent hydrochloric acid. The solution is filtered and completely decolorized by two to five treatments with 20\u201325 g. portions of decolorizing carbon (Norite) which has been completely freed from calcium phosphate by boiling with dilute hydrochloric acid and washing with cold water. The filtrate after decolorizing should be water-clear, or at the most only slightly yellow. If it shows more color, the treatment with decolorizing carbon should be carried out again. The solution should finally be filtered once by gravity to remove traces of a solid impurity which is apt to pass through the suction funnel.\nThe cystine is precipitated from the clear solution by adding a filtered saturated solution of 900\u20131000 g. of crystallized sodium acetate until the Congo red reaction is negative. After standing five to six hours (Note 8), the cystine is filtered and washed twice with 100\u2013200 cc. portions of hot, distilled water to remove the last traces of tyrosine. By this method the typical colorless hexagonal plates of cystine are obtained. The yield is 100\u2013106 g. (5.0\u20135.3 per cent of the weight of the starting material)."

To this is added 98.5 g. (0.81 mole) of diallylcyanamide (p. 203) and a few pieces of clay plate to prevent bumping. The mixture is refluxed gently for six hours. During the first fifteen minutes of heating, some bumping occurs. However, the mixture gradually becomes homogeneous and the boiling then proceeds smoothly (Note 1).\nAfter six hours, the solution is cooled to room temperature and a cold solution of 192 g.

The flask is then connected to a condenser for downward distillation and is shaken to mix the two layers. The resulting free amine separates. The flask is heated and the amine, together with some water, distils. The distillation is continued until no amine separates from a test portion of the distillate. There is a small quantity of an oily liquid left floating in the flask. This is probably an impurity from the diallylcyanamide.\nThe weight of water in the distillate is estimated, and about one-half of this amount of potassium hydroxide is added in the form of sticks, so that it will dissolve slowly. The mixture should be kept cool while the potassium hydroxide is dissolving. Bubbles of ammonia gas will be evolved. When solution of the potassium hydroxide is complete, the amine is separated and dried for several hours over solid sodium hydroxide which has been freshly broken up into small lumps.

The flask is arranged for outside cooling by running water. To the solution, 207 g.

In order to add the sodium at this rate, the flask must be cooled during the addition. When the sodium has entirely reacted and the mixture has been cooled to room temperature, the sodium chloride which has separated is removed by suction filtration with the use of thoroughly dry apparatus (Note 3). The salt is washed on the filter with 200 cc. of absolute alcohol, and the washings are allowed to run into the main filtrate.\nThe solution is placed in a 3-l. flask fitted with an 80-cm. fractionating column (Note 4), and the excess chloroform and most of the alcohol are distilled off on a steam or water bath. The distillate is caught in a 2-l. suction flask protected from moisture by a drying tube. This distillation requires five or six hours. A mixture of chloroform and alcohol, weighing about 2000 g., is recovered and saved for the next run (Note 3). The liquid remaining in the flask is decanted from the small amount of salt which has separated, into a Claisen flask with a 30-cm. fractionating column (Note 5). The mixture is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The fraction boiling below 85\u00b0 is mainly alcohol and is discarded. An intermediate fraction of about 100 g., boiling at 85\u2013140\u00b0, contains about one-fourth of the total yield. This may be fractionated but is best added to a subsequent run. The orthoformic ester is collected at 140\u2013146\u00b0 and weighs 120\u2013140 g. (27\u201331 per cent of the theoretical amount). There is practically no higher-boiling material. Another distillation gives almost all the material boiling over a 2\u00b0 range.\nAfter the first run, 400 g. of chloroform and enough absolute alcohol (800\u20131000 cc.) are added to the recovered chloroform-alcohol mixture to give a total volume of 3 l. The sodium is then added as before. After the excess of chloroform and alcohol has been distilled through the fractionating column, the intermediate fraction from the previous run is added before fractionating. The yield from such a run is about 200 g. (45 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6) and (Note 7)."

The flask is then fitted with a fractionating column, 1 meter long, to which are attached a condenser and an automatic separator so arranged that the lighter liquid flows off to a receiver (Fig. 13) (Note 1). The heavier liquid flows through a tower of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and then returns to the reaction flask. The bottom of the tower is connected with a small separatory funnel through which any potassium carbonate solution, which flows from the solid in the tower, may be withdrawn from time to time.\nThe mixture in the flask is slowly distilled (Note 2). As soon as about 500 cc. of the lighter liquid has collected, it is placed in a fractionating apparatus and distilled, the material which boils up to 79\u00b0 being collected separately. This fraction, which consists principally of alcohol, with a little carbon tetrachloride and moisture, is dried with potassium carbonate and returned to the reaction mixture (Note 3). The higher fractions are redistilled.\nThe above process is continued until the distillate no longer separates into two phases (about twenty-seven hours). The liquid in the flask is then distilled with the use of a column until the temperature of the vapor reaches 85\u00b0; the residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 106\u2013107\u00b0/25 mm. is collected. The yield is 920\u2013960 g. of a colorless liquid (80\u201383 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4).",

The oxalic acid, which is almost anhydrous (weighing approximately 180 g.), is placed in a 1.5-l. round-bottomed flask, A, containing 500 cc. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) and fitted up as shown in Fig. 14.\nFig. 14.\nThe flask A is heated by means of an oil bath maintained at 120\u2013125\u00b0 (Note 2); the mixed vapors of alcohol and water, passing through the fractionating column, are condensed in D, and the moist alcohol is delivered under the surface of the alcohol contained in flask B. In flask B are placed 250 cc. of absolute alcohol and about 200 g. of freshly ignited potassium carbonate. Flask B is heated in an oil bath maintained at about 95\u2013100\u00b0. The moist alcohol delivered to the flask B is dried by the potassium carbonate and subsequently returned as vapor under the surface of the liquid in flask A. The tube C, which is provided with a calcium chloride tube and is open to the air, acts as a vent for the otherwise closed system. The reaction is run for about five hours. The excess alcohol is then distilled, the residue of ethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 98\u2013101\u00b0/21 mm. is collected. The yield is 234\u2013264 g.

The light yellow filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to 175 cc. (Note 1) and allowed to stand overnight at \u22128\u00b0. The crystals which separate, amounting to 25\u201326 g., are filtered off on hardened paper. The mother liquor is further concentrated to 75 cc. and again allowed to stand overnight at \u22128\u00b0.

(43 cc., 0.52 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) has been added to dissolve the amine (Note 3); and, finally, a solution of 110 g. (1.58 moles) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Note 4) in 500 cc. of water. The flask is heated over a wire gauze by a Meker burner so that vigorous boiling begins in about forty to forty-five minutes. After one to two minutes (Note 5) of vigorous boiling the reaction is complete. During the heating period, some crystals of isonitrosoacetanilide separate. On cooling the solution in running water the remainder crystallizes, is filtered with suction, and air-dried. The yield is 65\u201375 g. (80\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 175\u00b0.\n(B) Isatin.\u2014Six hundred grams (326 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is warmed to 50\u00b0 in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, and, to this, 75 g. (0.46 mole) of dry (Note 6) isonitrosoacetanilide is added at such a rate as to keep the temperature between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 but not higher (Note 7). External cooling should be applied at this stage so that the reaction can be carried out more rapidly. After the addition of the isonitroso compound is finished, the solution is heated to 80\u00b0 and kept at this temperature for about ten minutes to complete the reaction. Then the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured upon ten to twelve times its volume of cracked ice. After standing for about one-half hour, the isatin is filtered with suction, washed several times with cold water to remove the sulfuric acid, and then dried in the air. The yield of crude isatin, which melts at 189\u2013192\u00b0, is 47\u201352 g. (71\u201378 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is pure enough for many purposes (Note 8).\nFor purification, 200 g. of the crude product is suspended in 1 l. of hot water and treated with a solution of 88 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water. The solution is stirred mechanically and the isatin passes into solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then added, with stirring, until a slight precipitate appears. This requires about 290\u2013300 cc. of an acid made by diluting one volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with two volumes of water (Note 9). The mixture is then filtered at once, the precipitate is rejected, and the filtrate is made acid to Congo red paper with hydrochloric acid. The solution is then cooled rapidly, and the isatin which separates is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The pure product thus obtained weighs 150\u2013170 g. (Note 10) and (Note 11) and melts at 197\u2013200\u00b0 (corr.).\nIsatin may also be crystallized from three times its weight of glacial acetic acid. In this case it is obtained in large brown-red crystals which melt at 196\u2013197\u00b0."

            "In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and 500-cc. separatory funnel, is placed 13.4 g. (0.55 atom) of magnesium shavings (Note 1). The shavings are then covered with 50 cc. of anhydrous ether. A crystal or two of iodine and 3 g. of sec.-butyl chloride (Note 2) are added. The reaction is started by warming the flask with a microburner and is then allowed to proceed by its own heat for twenty minutes. A second addition of 50 cc. of anhydrous ether is made. A solution of 43 g. (the remainder of 0.5 mole) of sec.-butyl chloride in 300 cc. anhydrous ether is added over a period of twenty minutes. Vigorous refluxing is avoided by externally cooling the flask with water. The heat from the reaction causes refluxing to continue for twenty minutes after the addition of the halide solution. The reaction mixture is then gently refluxed for one hour with a microburner. The reaction flask is surrounded by an ice and salt mixture and the solution cooled to \u2212 12\u00b0 in an atmosphere of nitrogen (Note 3). The nitrogen gas, obtained directly from a cylinder, is dried by passing through two wash bottles containing concentrated sulfuric acid and a phosphorus pentoxide tower. It is admitted to the flask through an entry tube 10 mm. in diameter at a height of about 60 mm. above the surface of the ether solution. An additional 100 cc. of ether is added, and the separatory funnel is replaced by a thermometer.\nThe cylinder of nitrogen is then replaced by a cylinder of carbon dioxide. The gas after passing through the drying train enters the reaction flask through the entry tube (Note 4). The rate of flow is regulated so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above \u2212 5\u00b0 when rapid stirring is in progress. After one and one-half hours (Note 5) the temperature drops to \u2212 12\u00b0 and does not rise on increasing the rate of flow of carbon dioxide. The drop in temperature is taken as an end-point for the carbonation.\nThe reaction mixture is then hydrolyzed in the flask with about 500 cc. of 25 per cent sulfuric acid (Note 6). Cooling the solution with ice and water permits of rapid hydrolysis without danger of loss of material through too vigorous refluxing. The mixture is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and the ether layer separated. The water layer is extracted with three 50-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with about 150 cc. of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until all the organic acid is converted to the salt and thus removed (Note 7) and (Note 8).\nThe alkaline extract is boiled in a distillation apparatus, to remove ether and other volatile impurities, until its volume is decreased by 10 per cent. It is then acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the acid layer separated. The water layer is then distilled from a 1-l. flask until no more oily acid comes over (Note 9). The distillate is saturated with salt and the acid layer separated. This water layer, together with the low-boiling fraction from the acid distillation, is distilled, and the distillate salted out as before.\nThe combined acid layers are distilled from a 75-cc. flask connected to an air condenser. The product is collected at 173\u2013174\u00b0. The yield of acid is 39\u201344 g. (76\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the quantity of sec.-butyl chloride used) (Note 10)."

The mixture is heated to the boiling point until all the precipitated amine sulfate has been brought into solution. The solution is somewhat pink. The hot solution is poured rapidly through a large funnel (without a paper), which has been warmed on the steam bath, into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing a filtered solution at room temperature of 70 g. (2.4 moles) of potassium dichromate in 1 l. of water. The flask is shaken to mix the contents thoroughly. The quinone separates at once as a mass of fine, yellow needles. After cooling to 25\u00b0 the material is collected, washed with water, and dried at 30\u201340\u00b0. The crude product is dull yellow; it melts at 124\u2013125\u00b0 to a dark liquid and weighs 53\u201355 g. (Note 1).\nThe crude naphthoquinone is warmed gently on the steam bath with 1.5 l. of ether, when it rapidly dissolves and leaves in suspension a slight amount of dark, fluffy material. The solution is shaken for ten minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon; it is then filtered, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath until crystals begin to form. The solution is then allowed to cool undisturbed, and the clear canary-yellow prisms which separate are collected and washed with ether. The mother liquor is clarified by shaking as before with 7 g. of decolorizing carbon, filtered, and evaporated to a small volume until crystals begin to separate. The crystals are again washed with ether, and the mother liquor is clarified and evaporated once more. The final crop of material is dull in color but yields a pure product on recrystallization. All the material is of a high quality and melts at 124\u2013125\u00b0 to a clear yellow liquid; the yield is 44\u201346 g. (78\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 2)."

(3.29 atoms) of magnesium turnings and 800 cc. of dry benzene (Note 3). Through the dropping funnel is added gradually a solution of 90 g. of mercuric chloride in 400 g. (505 cc., 6.9 moles) of acetone (Note 4), carefully at first and then more rapidly after the reaction starts. The time of addition is about five to ten minutes (Note 5). Sometimes the reaction does not commence until a considerable proportion of the acetone solution of mercuric chloride has been added. In this case the reaction proceeds very vigorously when it does start, and the flask must be cooled in running water to avoid loss through the condenser. As soon as the first vigorous reaction is over, a mixture of 200 g. (258 cc., 3.45 moles) of acetone and 200 cc. of benzene is added (Note 6). When the reaction slows down, the flask is heated on a water bath until no further reaction is evident (about two hours). During this time the magnesium pinacolate swells until it fills the flask about three-fourths full. The flask is removed from the condenser and shaken until the reaction mass is well broken up (Note 7). The condenser is again attached and the heating continued for another hour.\nThrough the separatory funnel is then added 200 cc. of water, and the reaction mixture is heated for another hour. The flask should be shaken occasionally during this time. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 50\u00b0 and filtered. The solid is returned to the flask and heated for ten minutes with a fresh 500-cc. portion of benzene to dissolve any remaining pinacol. The original filtrate and the second portion of benzene, after it is filtered from the magnesium hydroxide, are mixed and distilled to one-half the original volume in order to remove the acetone; the remaining benzene solution is treated with 300 cc. of water and cooled to 10\u201315\u00b0. The pinacol hydrate separates, and after about thirty minutes (Note 8) it is collected on a suction filter and washed with benzene, or better, the mixture is centrifuged in a basket centrifuge. The pinacol hydrate, air-dried at room temperature (Note 9), weighs 325\u2013375 g. (43\u201350 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the magnesium used) (Note 2). The product melts at 46\u201347\u00b0. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes. Occasionally the product is slightly yellow. If such a product is dissolved in an equal weight of boiling water, treated with a little animal charcoal, filtered, and the filtrate cooled in ice, over 95 per cent of the material may be recovered in large white crystals (Note 10)."

The mixture is then distilled until the upper layer of distillate ceases to increase in volume (Note 3). This requires about fifteen to twenty minutes. The pinacolone layer in the distillate is separated from the water and the water is returned to the reaction flask. First, 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to the water, and then a second 250-g. portion of pinacol hydrate. The distillation is repeated. This process is repeated twice more until 1 kg.

            "(A) Apparatus.\u2014The reduction is carried out in a 15 by 23 cm. battery jar (Note 1), which is surrounded by a vessel suitable for a cooling bath. The bottom of the battery jar is covered with mercury, which serves as the cathode of the cell. The anode is a heavy lead coil separated from the catholyte by being suspended in a porous cup. This cup is set upon a support which holds it just above the cathode surface and does not appreciably diminish the latter (Note 2). The cathode is connected with the circuit by means of a glass tube partially filled with mercury and carrying a small piece of platinum wire sealed through the lower end. An efficient mechanical stirrer is provided in the catholyte. The current used in these experiments was 110 d.c., with a field rheostat, having a resistance of 8 ohms and a capacity of 20 amperes, for controlling the current. Any source of current supplying 30\u2013110 volts and 15\u201320 amperes and any rheostat capable of carrying this current may be used. An ammeter reading to at least 15 amperes is connected in the circuit. Several reduction cells of the size described above may be run at one time, if they are connected in series. Figure 25 shows the general set-up.\nFig. 25.\n(B) Reduction of Nitrourea.\u2014After the apparatus is assembled, 600 cc. of 20 per cent sulfuric acid (Note 3) is placed in the battery jar, and the lead anode in the porous cup is also covered with acid of the same strength. The cell is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, the stirrer is started, and, while the solution is cooling, 50 g. (0.48 mole) of nitrourea (Note 4) is added to the catholyte. A thermometer is placed in the catholyte, and when the temperature drops to +5\u00b0 the current is turned on as follows: with the rheostat set for maximum resistance, the current is switched on, then the rheostat is gradually adjusted until the current flowing through the cell is about 0.06 ampere per square centimeter of cathode surface (Note 5). The cell must be efficiently cooled with ice and salt so as to keep the temperature at all times below 10\u00b0 (Note 6). The reduction requires five to six hours. The nitrourea is quite insoluble but gradually dissolves as it is reduced. The foam and clumps of solid are worked down into the liquid occasionally. When almost all the nitrourea is in solution, some of the catholyte should be drawn up with a pipette and used to wash down the nitrourea that adheres to the walls of the vessel. The reduction is continued for about ten to twenty minutes after the nitrourea has dissolved. When the reduction is complete, as is indicated by a marked evolution of hydrogen, the current is shut off, and the porous cup is washed down with a little distilled water and removed.\nThe solution of semicarbazide sulfate is removed from the cell and filtered (Note 7). The filtered solution is concentrated under reduced pressure on a water bath (Note 8) to a volume of 125\u2013150 cc. Meanwhile, considerable semicarbazide sulfate will have crystallized. The mixture is cooled thoroughly in ice and the crystals are collected on a hardened filter paper, or better, on a filtros plate (see Note 5, on p. 11), and washed several times with absolute alcohol to remove sulfuric acid. The crystals are dried on clay plate or paper. The yield is 50\u201357 g. (61\u201369 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 144\u2013145\u00b0 with decomposition."

The mechanical agitation is started and the flask is cooled in a mixture of ice and salt. When the temperature has fallen to \u22125\u00b0, the bromine is allowed to drop in slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains at about \u2212 5\u00b0 and never rises above 0\u00b0 (Note 3). The addition of the bromine requires about one and one-half hours. The solution is usually orange-red in color at the end of the reaction, owing to the slight excess of bromine. It is allowed to warm up to room temperature with continuous stirring (about one-half hour) and is then transferred to a large separatory funnel. The flask is washed once with a 10\u201315 cc. portion of carbon tetrachloride.\nA 500-cc. Claisen flask is arranged for distilling the solvent and the solution is dropped in from the funnel at such a rate that the flask is never more than two-thirds full. The Claisen flask is heated in an oil bath, and the carbon tetrachloride distils when the oil bath reaches about 120\u00b0. As much as possible of the solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure by allowing the temperature of the oil bath to rise to 150\u00b0. The remainder of the carbon tetrachloride is removed under a pressure of about 20 mm. by collecting a fraction until the thermometer registers a sudden rise (temperature of the oil bath about 120\u00b0).\nThe residue in the distilling flask is practically pure 1,2,3-tribromopropane (Note 4) and boils at 100\u2013103\u00b0/18 mm. On cooling in an ice-salt mixture and scratching vigorously, the tribromopropane solidifies to a mass of white needles, which melt below room temperature. The yield is 406\u2013413 g. (96\u201398 per cent of the theoretical amount). If an absolutely colorless product is desired, it is advisable to collect the first few drops of distillate separately, since they may be slightly yellow. The product on long standing becomes yellow, but when the colored product is used in reactions it gives yields that indicate a high degree of purity."
