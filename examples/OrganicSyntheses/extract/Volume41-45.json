        "Procedure": [
            "In a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer of high torque (Note 1), a reflux condenser with a calcium chloride drying tube, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel are placed 133 g. (1.00 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 200 ml. of dry carbon disulfide. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and stirred while 182 g. (1.50 moles) of N,N-dimethylaniline (Note 2) is added through the dropping funnel during a period of 15 minutes. The dropping funnel is rinsed with 20 ml. of carbon disulfide which is then run into the flask. Any aluminum chloride sticking to the walls of the flask is now scraped into the mixture, which is an easily stirred slurry of a white solid in a light-green liquid.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to 5\u201310\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath (Note 3), and, with continued stirring, a solution of 31.7 g. (21.3 ml., 0.250 mole) of oxalyl chloride in 200 ml. of dry carbon disulfide is added through the dropping funnel in the course of 20 minutes. After the addition is complete, the thick black reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, refluxed for 1 hour, and then cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 in an ice bath. The mixture is stirred throughout these steps. One hundred grams of chipped ice is added with stirring, followed by 400 ml. of cold water. Steam is then passed into the flask until the carbon disulfide and unreacted dimethylaniline are removed, and the green-black aluminum complex is decomposed to a mixture of a green solid and a blue solid; this requires 1\u20132 hours (Note 4). The mixture is cooled to 50\u00b0, and the solid, which is principally 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzil, is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel. In order to remove the major part of the impurity, which is somewhat soluble in water, the solid is slurried in 200 ml. of water at 50\u00b0, and the slurry is filtered. This process is repeated twice, and the crude benzil, now a green solid, is washed successively on the funnel with 200 ml. of water at 50\u00b0 and with 100 ml. of cold methanol. After being dried in air, it weighs 44\u201355 g. and melts at 191\u2013196\u00b0.\nThe crude benzil is dissolved in 500 ml. of chloroform. To remove the impurity that remains (Note 5), the solution is shaken with three 400-ml. portions of 6% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution containing 1.0 g. of sodium hydroxide in each portion, and finally with 500 ml. of water. The aqueous layers are combined, warmed to drive off dissolved chloroform, and filtered to separate about 1.5 g. of a yellow-green solid, which is dissolved in the chloroform solution.\nThe chloroform layer is distilled to dryness and the residue is dissolved in 1.5 l. of acetone under reflux. The hot acetone solution is filtered and then allowed to cool in a refrigerator. Yellow 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzil crystallizes from the acetone solution. It is separated by filtration and washed with 100 ml. of cold methanol. After being dried in air, it weighs 28\u201331 g. (38\u201342%); m.p. 200\u2013202\u00b0; \u03bbmaxCH3OH 371 m\u03bc(\u03b5 44,700) (Note 6).\nThe acetone filtrate is concentrated to 700 ml. and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0. An additional 4\u20138 g. (6\u201311%) of slightly less pure benzil, m.p. 198\u2013201\u00b0, crystallizes from solution (Note 7)."

            "In a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube are placed 340 g. (4 moles) of cyanoacetic acid (Note 1) and 2 l. of anhydrous ether. To the stirred solution, 834 g. (4 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride is added in portions through the third neck of the flask, which is sealed between additions. The mixture is cooled occasionally with an ice bath to prevent excessive refluxing, and, after the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 0.5 hour or until the phosphorus pentachloride dissolves completely. The reflux condenser is removed and replaced with apparatus for downward distillation (Note 2), and the ether is distilled from a water bath at 50\u201360\u00b0 (Note 3), after which most of the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at reduced pressure (20\u201325 mm. with a bath temperature of 55\u201365\u00b0) (Note 4), the receiver being cooled in an ice-salt bath. The red, oily residue is dissolved in 200 ml. of benzene and the benzene and residual phosphorus oxychloride distilled under reduced pressure. This operation is repeated with 200 ml. of fresh benzene to ensure complete removal of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 5). The residue is then cooled to room temperature (Note 6) and is transferred to a 500-ml. pressure-equalized dropping funnel for immediate use in the following step.\nThe same 5-l. flask used in the preceding step is used again, without washing; it is fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube, a sealed mechanical stirrer, and the dropping funnel containing the acid chloride. In the flask are placed 296 g. (4 moles) of dry t-butyl alcohol (Note 7) and 484 g. (4 moles) of dimethylaniline in 600 ml. of anhydrous ether (Note 8). The acid chloride is added dropwise to the stirred solution, the mixture being cooled occasionally with an ice bath to prevent excessive refluxing. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours and then stirred gently at room temperature for 15 hours. Two liters of water is added with stirring, and the mixture is filtered with suction through a B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with a matting of glass wool (Note 9). The matting is washed with three 250-ml. portions of ether (Note 10). After separation of the combined ethereal layers, the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with successive portions of 2N sulfuric acid (a total of 1 l.) until free of dimethylaniline, then with two 200-ml. portions of 2N sodium carbonate solution, and dried over sodium carbonate. After removal of the ether by distillation, the residue is transferred to an alkali-washed flask and distilled at reduced pressure through a 20-cm. alkali-washed Vigreux column (Note 11). The yield of colorless product is 355\u2013378 g. (63\u201367%) boiling at 67\u201368\u00b0/1.5mm. (90\u00b0/10 mm., 54\u201356\u00b0/0.3 mm), nD20 = 1.4198."

Erlenmeyer flask is added 0.3 ml. of a catalyst stock solution containing 0.0016 ml. (0.018 mmole) of concentrated fluoboric acid (Note 2) in 3:1 anhydrous diethyl ether-methylene chloride (Note 3). The solution is swirled, and a 0.45M solution of diazomethane (Note 4) in dry methylene chloride is added from a buret (Note 5) at a rate of about 2 ml. per minute. The yellow color of diazomethane disappears rapidly on contact with the reaction mixture and nitrogen is vigorously evolved. When about 3 ml. of diazomethane solution has been added, the reaction becomes sluggish. The yellow color persists for several minutes after the total amount of 3.9 ml. of diazomethane solution (1.76 mmoles) has been added (Note 6). After 1 hour the reaction mixture is filtered to remove a small amount of amorphous polymethylene, which is washed with methylene chloride. The washings are combined with the methylene chloride solution, washed with 5 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, with three 5-ml. portions of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a steam bath in a stream of nitrogen and finally at reduced pressure. The crystalline residue of 0.207 g. (Note 7) is recrystallized in a 10-ml. conical flask from 1 ml. of acetone. When the flask has cooled to room temperature, 0.5 ml. of methanol is added, and the flask is chilled to +2\u00b0 for 2 hours. The crystals are collected on a tared Hirsch funnel of 40-mm. diameter, washed on the funnel with two 0.5-ml. portions of ice-cold methanol, and dried for 2 hours at 40\u00b0/2 mm. The first crop of cholestanyl methyl ether thus obtained forms large colorless glistening plates, m.p. 85.5\u201386\u00b0 (Note 8). An additional 0.002 g. of pure methyl ether adheres to the flask and spatula and is collected by washing with acetone. The total first crop material (0.197 g.) represents a 95% yield of methyl ether (Note 9)."

The nitrogen-inlet tube, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser are removed, and the reaction flask is fitted with a 15 \u00d7 150-mm. Vigreux column for distillation under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture is then distilled (Note 4).

(1.78 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets and 500 ml. of water. A thermometer may be so placed in the third neck that the bulb extends below the surface of the solution. To this solution is added 300 g. (1.71 moles) of methyl 4-methyl-4-nitrovalerate.2 The mixture is stirred and gently heated (Note 1) and (Note 2). After hydrolysis has started, as indicated by changes in appearance of the hazy reaction mixture, the external source of heat is removed. The reaction is complete when the cloudy mixture has changed to a clear solution. This requires about 20\u201325 minutes (Note 3).\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and a saturated solution of potassium permanganate is added in an amount sufficient for a violet color to persist for about 1 minute before turning green (Note 4). About 100\u2013110 ml. is required. Manganese dioxide is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride to remove non-acidic organic material. The aqueous layer is acidified with 18% hydrochloric acid, whereupon a pale yellow or green oil separates as a bottom layer. The oil is removed, and the aqueous layer is washed with methylene chloride. The washings are added to the oil, and the combined product is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Methylene chloride is removed by distillation, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure through a 6-in. Vigreux column (Note 5). The fraction boiling at 125\u2013135\u00b0 (0.9\u20131.5 mm.) amounts to 217\u2013225 g. (79\u201382%) and is a colorless oil that crystallizes on standing or when seeded to give a solid with a melting point of approximately 35\u201345\u00b0. This fraction is redistilled through a 24-in. spinning-band column and gives 166\u2013180 g. (60\u201365%) of colorless 4-methyl-4-nitrovaleric acid, b.p. 122\u2013124\u00b0/0.70\u20130.90 mm., m.p. 45\u201346\u00b0 (Note 6).",
            "B. 2,7-Dimethyl-2,7-dinitro\u00f6ctane. A 200-mm. desiccator is adapted for use as an electrolysis cell. A lid is prepared from a glass plate ground to fit the desiccator; holes are bored in the lid to accommodate electrodes, a thermometer, and a stirrer, and to provide an opening for making additions to the cathode compartment. The cathode (Note 7) is placed in a porous ceramic cup having outside dimensions 4 in. deep, 6 in. long, and 2 in. wide (Note 8). This cup is placed on the glazed ceramic plate of the desiccator under the holes cut in the lid for the cathode and for making additions. The glazed ceramic plate is notched so that it can be slipped down over the supports in the bottom of the desiccator. The notches should be large enough for the ceramic plate to be about halfway between its normal position and the bottom of the desiccator (Note 9). The cathode is a 26-gauge stainless-steel plate 3 in. square (Note 10), and the anode consists of two platinum plates each 0.01 in. thick and 3 in. square (Note 11) placed as close as possible, one on either side, to the ceramic cup without touching the sides of the cup.\nA solution made by dissolving 161 g. (1 mole) of 4-methyl-4-nitrovaleric acid and 33.0 g. (0.5 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 2.7 l. of methanol is added to the cell. The ceramic cup is filled with 200 ml. of 2N potassium hydroxide in methanol. The cell contents are cooled to 20\u00b0 (Note 12), and current is passed through the solution (Note 13). When the current is turned on, vigorous evolution of hydrogen takes place inside the porous cup. Potassium hydroxide (2N) in methanol is added as needed to maintain the original volume inside the cup (Note 14). Carbon dioxide is evolved at the anodes. After about 5 hours, white crystals of the dinitro\u00f6ctane form in the anode solution. As electrolysis proceeds, the resistance of the cell increases, and after several hours the cell is operated at 3\u20135 amperes and 60\u201380 volts. If a current of 3\u20135 amperes cannot be maintained, it is desirable to add 2N potassium hydroxide in methanol to the anode compartment (Note 15) and (Note 16). After 8 hours of operation, the current is shut off, the ceramic cup removed and cleaned, and the anode solution cooled to about \u221230\u00b0. The anode solution is filtered to remove crystals of 2,7-dimethyl-2,7-dinitro\u00f6ctane. The yield of dry product, m.p. 98\u2013100\u00b0, amounts to 50\u201365.5 g. (43\u201356%), which is sufficiently pure for most uses (Note 17). One recrystallization from methanol (Note 18) gives pure 2,7-dimethyl-2,7-dinitro\u00f6ctane, m.p. 100\u2013101\u00b0 (lit.3 101.5\u2013102\u00b0)."

After the system has been flushed thoroughly with prepurified nitrogen, 113 ml. of a 1.13N solution of phenyllithium (0.127 mole) in diethyl ether (Note 4) is added rapidly to the stirred allyltriphenyltin solution. Precipitation of tetraphenyltin occurs immediately, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes in an atmosphere of prepurified nitrogen. Through the dropping funnel is then added 12.0 g. (0.12 mole) of 4-methyl-2-pentanone (Note 5) in 25 ml. of diethyl ether at such a rate that moderate reflux is maintained. Subsequently the reaction mixture is refluxed for 1 hour, allowed to cool to room temperature, and hydrolyzed by adding 100 ml. of distilled water (Note 6). The solid tetraphenyltin is filtered (53.5 g. = 98% yield), and the filtrate is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal extracts and the organic layer are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether by distillation at atmospheric pressure, the residue is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel into a 250-ml. distilling flask and fractionally distilled at reduced pressure using a vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column equipped with a still head of the total-condensing, partial-takeoff type. 4,6-Dimethyl-1-hepten-4-ol, b.p. 70\u201371\u00b0/20 mm., nD20 1.4403, is obtained in 70\u201375% yield (12.0\u201312.8 g.)

            "To 500 ml. of absolute methanol (Note 1) in a 1-l. electrolytic (tall form) beaker is added 1.1 g. (0.05 g. atom) of clean sodium metal. After solution of the sodium, 216 g. (1.0 mole) of methyl hydrogen sebacate (Note 2) is dissolved in the sodium methoxide solution. A magnetic stirring bar is placed in the beaker which is then fitted with a large neoprene stopper (Note 3) holding a platinum sheet anode, 12 cm.2 in area; and two platinum sheet cathodes, approximately 5.3 cm.2 in area, spaced equidistantly on either side of the anode at a distance of approximately 1.5 cm. (Note 4). The stopper is also provided with a stoppered entry tube and an efficient reflux condenser (Note 5).\nThe electrodes are connected to a suitable variable source of direct current (Note 6), the magnetic stirrer is started, and a potential of about 50 volts is applied. This results in a current flow of 1\u20132 amperes. The solution soon comes to boiling; the voltage is then regulated so that a rapid reflux is maintained (Note 7).\nCompletion of the run, after 30\u201340 hours, is indicated when a few drops of the solution show an alkaline reaction to phenolphthalein. No harm is done if the electrolysis is carried a few hours beyond this point; however, after excessively long periods, formation of polymeric material lowers the yield and renders purification of the product rather troublesome.\nUpon completion of the reaction (Note 8) the solution is acidified with acetic acid, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in about 1.4 l. of ether and filtered into a 2-l. separatory funnel through fluted paper. After the ether solution has been washed with two 300-ml. portions of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 9), the ether is removed on a steam bath. The residue is dissolved in about 1.5 l. of warm methanol, and the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystallized product is collected by suction filtration on a B\u00fcchner funnel and pressed well. The product is rather waxy and is best washed by transferring it to a beaker and stirring thoroughly with about 150 ml. of cold methanol. The white crystals are then collected and pressed well again. If the filtrate is colored, the crystals are washed again with a smaller quantity of methanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to one-half the original volume and chilled in ice to yield a few grams of additional product of the same melting point. The combined lots are dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield amounts to 116\u2013126 g. (68\u201374%) of white, microcrystalline dimethyl octadecanedioate, m.p. 57\u201358\u00b0."

            "A. 1,5-Hexadien-3-ol (Note 1). In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel and an ice-water condenser are placed 153.0 g. (6.28 g. atoms) of magnesium turnings, 360 ml. of anhydrous ether (Note 2), and a few crystals of iodine. A solution of 351.0 g. (2.90 moles) of allyl bromide (Note 3) in 2.6 l. of ether is added in small portions until the reaction begins, and then at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing of the ether. The addition requires about 3 hours, after which the reaction mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for an additional hour. Acrolein (Note 4) (104.0 g., 1.86 moles) is added during 2 hours, and this causes gentle refluxing. After an additional hour at room temperature the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 2 l. of ice water. The precipitate is dissolved by adding slowly a solution of 120 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 400 ml. of water (Note 5). The organic layer is separated and the water layer extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are dried over 8\u201310 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether, the residue is distilled through a 6-in. column packed with glass helices to yield 104\u2013108 g. (57\u201359%, based on acrolein) of 1,5-hexadien-3-ol; b.p. 62\u201365/50 mm., nD25 1.4440.",
            "B. 1,3,5-Hexatriene. In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a graduated dropping funnel are placed 114 g. (0.42 mole) of phosphorus tribromide (Note 6) and 2 drops of 48% hydrobromic acid. As the contents of the flask are stirred and maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0 by means of an ice-water bath, 98 g. (1.00 mole) of 1,5-hexadien-3-ol is added in the course of 1.5 to 1.75 hours. The mixture is allowed to stir at 10\u201315\u00b0 for 40 minutes and then to stand at room temperature overnight. The flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath for 20 minutes, and the upper organic layer is decanted from the residue while still cold. The organic layer is successively washed with three 40-ml. portions each of ice water, 5% sodium bicarbonate, and water. The crude bromohexadiene weighs 147\u2013153 g. (91\u201395%) (Note 7).\nIn an assembly similar to that used for the previous reaction, 90 g. (0.67 mole) of dimethylbenzylamine (Note 8), 0.13 g. of hydroquinone, and 500 ml. of water are stirred and heated at 50\u00b0. The crude bromohexadiene (107 g., 0.67 mole) is added in the course of 20\u201340 minutes, and stirring and heating are maintained at 50\u00b0 for 2\u20132.5 more hours. The flask is then fitted for downward distillation, and the mixture is distilled at about 40\u201350\u00b0 and 30 mm. until no more oil distils with the water. A total of 133\u2013200 ml. of distillate is collected. This is discarded.\nA solution of sodium hydroxide (106 g., 2.7 moles) in 535 ml. of water is placed in a 2-l. flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an outlet arranged for downward distillation into an ice-cooled receiver. The aqueous solution of the quaternary bromide is added dropwise to the boiling solution of sodium hydroxide during a period of 2.5\u20134 hours (Note 9). The hexatriene and dimethylbenzylamine which form are distilled with the water. Distillation is continued for 10\u201315 minutes after the final addition of quaternary bromide solution. The clear upper layer of the distillate is separated, cooled to 5\u201310\u00b0, washed with three 170-ml. portions each of cold 2N hydrochloric acid and water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The oil is then distilled, a spinning-band column being used to give 32.0\u201334.0 g.. (54\u201360%) of 1,3,5-hexatriene; b.p. 80\u201380.5\u00b0, nD20 1.5103\u20131.5119 (Note 10)."

            "In a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer are placed 700 ml. of formic acid (88%) and 140 ml. of hydrogen peroxide (30%, 1.37 moles). While the temperature is kept at 35\u201340\u00b0 (Note 1), 116.2 g. (117.3 ml., 1.00 mole) of indene (98%) (Note 2) is added dropwise, with stirring, over a period of 2 hours. An additional 100 ml. of formic acid is used to rinse the last of the indene from the dropping funnel into the reaction flask. The reaction solution is stirred at room temperature for 7 hours to ensure complete reaction (Note 3). The solution is transferred to a 2- or 3-l. Claisen flask, and the formic acid is removed under aspirator pressure (b.p. 35\u201340\u00b0/20\u201330 mm.), care being taken to maintain the boiler temperature below 60\u00b0 (Note 4). The residue, after being cooled to room temperature, is a yellowish brown crystalline solid (Note 5), the color being due to contamination by a small amount of brownish oil.\nIn a 5-l. flask fitted with a long condenser (about 40 cm.) connected to an ice-cooled receiver is placed 2 l. of 7% (by volume) sulfuric acid. The solution is heated to boiling, and the crude monoformate of 1,2-indanediol is added. Steam is introduced and the mixture is steam distilled, while external heat is applied with a flame in order to maintain the boiler contents at a constant volume of 2 l. The steam distillation is carried out at the rate of about 1 l. per hour until 5\u20136 l. of distillate have been collected and the 2-indanone has stopped distilling (Note 6). The dark-brown oily residue becomes semisolid at room temperature.\nThe cold distillate is filtered with suction, and the white crystalline solid is sucked thoroughly dry on the filter (Note 7). The crystals are dried further in a vacuum desiccator (at about 1 mm.) at room temperature or below for about 12 hours. The melting point of the 2-indanone is 57\u201358\u00b0 (Note 8). The yield is 90\u2013107 g. (69\u201381%)."

(2.0 moles) (Note 1) of resorcinol (Note 2) is placed in a 1.3-l. hydrogenation bomb together with 40.0 g. of finely powdered nickel catalyst (Note 3). The hydrogenation is carried out under an initial pressure of about 1900 lb. of hydrogen with agitation. The reaction is slightly exothermic, and gentle heating is applied to maintain a temperature of 45\u201350\u00b0 (Note 4). The hydrogenation is continued until about a 10% excess of the theoretical amount of hydrogen (2.0 moles) has been absorbed (Note 5). At this point, the agitation is stopped, and the bomb is cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. beaker, and the catalyst is removed by filtration with the aid of three 50-ml. portions of water for the combined operations. The filtrate and washings are transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask and treated with 33.5 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (for partial neutralization), 145 ml. of dioxane, and 335 g. (2.4 moles) of methyl iodide (Note 6). The reaction mixture is refluxed for a total of 12\u201314 hours. After 7 or 8 hours, an additional 33.5 g. (0.24 mole) of methyl iodide is added. The system is cooled several hours in an ice bath, and the 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione which crystallizes is collected by filtration (Note 7), washed with four 200-ml. portions of cold water (Note 8), and then dried in an oven at 110\u00b0.

The flask is heated to about 100\u00b0 for a few minutes and then cooled to room temperature. A solution of 178 g. (1.30 moles) of n-butyl bromide in 300 ml. of dry ether is prepared; and of this solution about 10 ml., together with 30 ml. of dry ether, is run into the flask. The reaction is started by heating to reflux for a few seconds, the stirrer is started, and the remainder of the bromide solution is added at such a rate as to maintain constant reflux (about 1 hour).\nAfter the addition has been completed, the solution is heated under reflux for 10\u201315 minutes. The flask is now surrounded by an ice and water bath, and stirring is continued for 15 minutes (Note 4). From a graduated dropping funnel, a solution of 56.8 g.

The suspension is stirred vigorously, and 3N methanolic potassium hydroxide solution is added dropwise from the dropping funnel until, at an apparent pH of 6\u20138, but closer to pH 8 (pH paper), the paraformaldehyde begins to dissolve and the suspension assumes a clearer appearance. About 10 ml. of the alkaline solution is required, and the addition takes about 10 minutes. About 15\u201320 minutes after addition of the alkaline solution is complete, the paraformaldehyde dissolves completely. Shortly thereafter, the solution temperature reaches a maximum of 13\u201314 degrees above room temperature and then slowly drops. Stirring is continued 1 hour after addition of the alkaline solution is complete.\nStirring is continued while the added alkali is completely neutralized by adding concentrated (36N) sulfuric acid (1 ml.) dropwise from a medicine dropper over a period of about 3 minutes until an apparent pH of about 4 is reached (Note 2). The solution is then stirred for an hour, during which time the pH should not change (Note 3).\nThe precipitated potassium sulfate is filtered by passing the solution through a 12-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The light-yellow or yellowish green filtrate is transferred to a 5-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a Claisen head containing a capillary ebulliator tube and a thermometer, and connected to a water-cooled condenser. The condenser is connected through a vacuum adapter to a 3-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, cooled in ice, to act as a receiver. About 2.3 l. of pure, unchanged nitromethane is removed by distillation at aspirator pressure and a water-bath temperature of 40\u201350\u00b0. The distillation takes about 6\u20137 hours.\nThe golden-yellow residue (315\u2013365 g.) is transferred to a 1-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing an equal weight of diphenyl ether (Note 4). The flask is fitted with a Claisen head containing a capillary ebulliator tube and a thermometer, and connected to a water-cooled condenser. The condenser is connected to a 3- or 4-port fraction cutter fitted with 100\u2013500 ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flasks, at least one of which is 500 ml. or larger to accommodate the main fraction (Note 5). The mixture is distilled under the vacuum of a good pump. The fore-run, b.p. 29\u201333\u00b0 at about 0.10 mm., consisting of nitromethane (about 56 ml.), can be distilled at a water-bath temperature of 32\u201379\u00b0 and usually passes directly into the Dry Ice trap protecting the vacuum pump. The temperature then rises as 2-nitroethanol and diphenyl ether codistil. The main fraction, a two-phase distillate initially richer in 2-nitroethanol than diphenyl ether, gradually changes in composition until the proportion of 2-nitroethanol becomes negligible. The main fraction of 410\u2013425 g., b.p. 54\u201357\u00b0 at about 0.10 mm. (or 64\u201366\u00b0 at about 0.4 mm.), collects at a water-bath temperature of 79\u201388\u00b0. Care should be taken to prevent clogging of the condenser or fraction cutter with solid diphenyl ether (m.p. 27\u00b0). The distillation is continued until the proportion of 2-nitroethanol (lower layer) observed in the distillate becomes negligible, and the temperature suddenly starts to rise. At this point heating is stopped, but the residue is cooled to room temperature or below before the vacuum is broken (Note 6).\nThe two-phase main fraction of the distillate is placed in a 500-ml. separatory funnel and the lower layer of crude 2-nitroethanol (185\u2013200 g., 146\u2013158 ml., n25D 1.4493\u20131.4513, containing about 92\u201394 mole % 2-nitroethanol) is drawn off. The 2-nitroethanol is then extracted in a 500-ml. separatory funnel with an equal volume of light petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201368\u00b0, such as Skellysolve B) or hexane, and the colorless lower layer of 2-nitroethanol (174\u2013188 g., 46\u201349%, n25D 1.4432\u20131.4433, containing about 98 mole % 2-nitroethanol) is drawn off (Note 7) and (Note 8). The product turns light yellow after standing for a day or more."

(0.72 g. atom) of zinc-copper couple and 250 ml. of anhydrous ether. A crystal of iodine is added, and the mixture is stirred until the brown color has disappeared (Note 4). A mixture of 53.3 g. (0.65 mole) of cyclohexene and 190 g. (0.71 mole) of methylene iodide is added in one portion (Note 5). The reaction mixture is then heated under gentle reflux with stirring. After 30\u201345 minutes, a mildly exothermic reaction occurs which may require cessation of external heating. After the exothermic reaction has subsided (approximately 30 minutes), the mixture is stirred under reflux for 15 hours. At the end of this time, most of the gray couple has been converted to finely divided copper. The ether solution is decanted (Note 6) from the copper and unreacted couple, which are then washed with two 30-ml. portions of ether. The washes are combined with the bulk of the solution and shaken with two 100-ml. portions of saturated ammonium chloride solution (Note 7), 100 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 ml. of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The ether is distilled through a 20 \u00d7 2-cm. column packed with glass helices.

Dry tert-butyl alcohol (1250 ml.) is distilled directly into the reaction flask under nitrogen. One hundred grams (2.6 g. atoms) of potassium cut into about ten pieces is added. The stirred mixture spontaneously warms to the melting point of potassium (62\u00b0) in the course of 15\u201360 minutes, whereupon the metal disperses into droplets. As the potassium gradually dissolves, the temperature of the mixture rises to the boiling point of tert-butyl alcohol. The rate of solution of the potassium should be such that the tert-butyl alcohol refluxes gently, and this rate is regulated by the speed of stirring. If the boiling becomes too vigorous, the stirring is stopped completely, and if necessary the reaction vessel is cooled by immersion in a bath of cold oil kept in readiness for this purpose. Potassium tert-butoxide gradually precipitates, and the mixture is a thick suspension when all the potassium has reacted (Note 1).\nN-o-Tolylformamide (135 g., 1.00 mole) (Note 2) is added to the hot stirred suspension, which becomes a clear solution within a few minutes.

After the mixture has been heated for 8\u201312 hours, the flask is removed from the hot plate-stirrer and the black contents upon cooling separate into two layers. The upper layer, a brown mush of adamantane and other products, is decanted carefully from the lower black tarry layer into a 600-ml. beaker. The Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed five times with a total of 250 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) with decantation into the same beaker (Note 6), (Note 7). The petroleum ether suspension is warmed until all the adamantane is in solution; there should be an appreciable excess of solvent. The solution is decolorized by careful addition of 10 g. of chromatography-grade alumina, the hot solution filtered, and the alumina and the beaker washed thoroughly with solvent. The nearly colorless filtrate (Note 8) is concentrated to a volume of about 200 ml. by distillation and then cooled in a Dry Ice-acetone bath. The solid adamantane is removed by suction filtration and there results 27\u201330 g. (13.5\u201315.0%) of crystals, melting point about 255\u2013260\u00b0 (Note 9), (Note 10). One recrystallization from petroleum ether raises the melting point to 268\u2013270\u00b0 (Note 11), (Note 12)."

Careful heating is continued, and a mixture of 2-cyclopentenone and water begins to distil with the temperature in the distilling head rising from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 (Note 3). The temperature of the flask is gradually increased as necessary to maintain a reasonably rapid distillation rate.\nThe reaction is complete when approximately 10% of the original material remains in the distilling flask. The distillation normally requires 30\u201360 minutes.\nThe distillate, containing 2-cyclopentenone, water and varying amounts of cyclopentenediols, is dissolved in 150 ml. of methylene chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is carefully removed through a Vigreux column and the residue purified by distillation. After a forerun (b.p. 50\u2013150\u00b0), there is collected 44\u201349 g.

            "A. Hexahydrogallic acid. A solution of 50 g. (0.266 mole) of recrystallized gallic acid monohydrate (Note 1) in 225 ml. of 95% ethanol (Note 2) is placed in a 1-l. high-pressure hydrogenation bomb (Note 3) with 8 g. of 5% rhodium-alumina catalyst (Note 4). The bomb is then closed, hydrogen admitted at full tank pressure (2200 lb., (Note 5)), and the temperature raised to 90\u2013100\u00b0 (Note 6) while agitation is commenced. When the hydrogen uptake is complete (8\u201312 hours), heating is discontinued and the bomb is allowed to cool. The residual hydrogen is bled off, and the contents of the bomb are rinsed out with two 40-ml. portions of warm distilled water and then heated to boiling on the steam bath for 5 minutes to dissolve any product which has crystallized on the catalyst. After removal of the catalyst by suction filtration (Note 7), the colorless filtrate (Note 8) is concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure (preferably using a rotary evaporator). The viscous residue which may have begun to deposit crystals is diluted with 75\u2013100 ml. of ethyl acetate and the product allowed to crystallize at 0\u00b0 for several hours or overnight. The product is collected on a 9-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 75 ml. of cold 3:1 ethyl acetate-absolute ethanol and finally with 100 ml. of 30\u201340\u00b0 petroleum ether. When dry, it weighs 21\u201324 g. (45\u201351%); an additional 2\u20134 g. can usually be obtained by concentration of the mother liquors and crystallization from ethyl acetate. Recrystallization is achieved by dissolution of the combined products in the minimum amount of boiling water (Note 9), suction filtration if necessary to remove suspended matter (Note 10), addition of hot ethanol to bring the volume of the solution to about 110 ml., and finally addition of about 35 ml. of acetone, sufficient to produce a faint cloudiness. The solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and is then stored at 0\u00b0 overnight. The fine, colorless crystals are collected on a 7-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 80 ml. of cold 5:3 absolute ethanol-acetone, then with 100 ml. of 30\u201340\u00b0 petroleum ether. The product when dry weighs 18\u201320 g. (38\u201343%). The yield may be increased somewhat by concentration of the combined mother liquor and washings, and treatment as before with ethanol and acetone. The melting point is not a useful criterion of purity, since the hexahydrogallic acid decomposes on heating (Note 11). The product is apparently substantially the all-cis isomer.2",
            "B. Hexahydrogallic acid triacetate. A suspension of 10 g. (0.057 mole) of the dry, recrystallized hexahydrogallic acid in 40 ml. of acetic anhydride is treated with 1 drop of concentrated sulfuric acid, which initiates the reaction (Note 12). Most of the solid then goes into solution with some evolution of heat. The reaction is completed on a steam bath for 30 minutes. The acetic acid and most of the excess anhydride are then removed on the steam bath under reduced pressure with the aid of an oil pump. Twenty-five milliliters of water is added, and the mixture is shaken and heated on the steam bath for 10 minutes in order to hydrolyze residual acetic anhydride and the mixed anhydride of the product and acetic acid. Most of the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure on the steam bath; the product usually crystallizes during this process. About 15 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is heated on the steam bath until the solids dissolve. The solution is first allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and then stored at 0\u00b0 for several hours to complete crystallization. The colorless crystals are collected, washed rapidly with 10\u201315 ml. of cold water, and dried at 60\u00b0 or in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature. The yield is 15\u201317 g., m.p. 152\u2013154\u00b0. The product may be recrystallized by dissolution in 25\u201330 ml. of hot acetone and addition of 50 ml. of 30\u201340\u00b0 petroleum ether. The colorless crystalline granules are collected by suction filtration and washed with a small amount of 2:1 petroleum ether(30\u201340\u00b0)-acetone. The recrystallized product when dried amounts to 13.5\u201314.5 g. (78\u201384%), m.p. 155\u2013156\u00b0 (Note 13)."

            "Ninety grams (90.2 ml., 0.839 mole) of o-toluidine is slowly added to a mixture of 90 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 180 ml. (1.90 mole) of acetic anhydride contained in a 750-ml. two-necked flask equipped with a thermometer and a two-hole cork stopper for a gas inlet tube (Note 1). Acetylation occurs with evolution of heat. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath (Note 2) and nitrosated by rapid admission of a stream of nitrous gases (Note 3). The nitrous gases are obtained by the action of nitric acid (density 1.47) on sodium nitrite (Note 4). Technical grade, large-grain sodium nitrite (180 g.) is placed in a 1-l. suction flask to which a dropping funnel is fitted by means of a rubber stopper (Note 5). The acid (a total of about 250 ml. is used) is added dropwise from the dropping funnel. The rate of the gas evolution should be such that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between +1\u00b0 and +4\u00b0 (Note 6). The gas is passed through a wash bottle (with inlet and outlet positions reversed) containing some glass wool and positioned between the generating flask and the reaction flask. After about 6 hours the nitrosation is complete, and the solution exhibits a permanent black-green color due to excess N2O3 (Note 7).\nThe solution of N-nitroso-o-acetotoluidide is poured onto a mixture of 400 g. of ice and 200 ml. of ice water in a beaker, covered loosely with a watch glass, and allowed to stand in an ice bath for 2 hours. The oil which separates is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted by shaking with several portions of benzene (total volume 500 ml.). The combined extract is washed with three 100-ml. portions of ice water and, after shaking with 30 ml. of methanol to remove remaining acetic anhydride, is allowed to stand, lightly covered, in an ice bath for 1 hour. Next, the mixture is washed with three 100-ml. portions of ice water, and the cold benzene solution is allowed to stand, loosely covered, over calcium chloride in the refrigerator overnight (Note 8). The brown solution is decanted from the drying agent into a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and the calcium chloride is washed (by decantation) with 800 ml. of benzene. The combined benzene layer and washings are warmed to 35\u00b0 in a large water bath and maintained at this temperature for 1 hour (internal temperature, (Note 9)(Note 10)), and then at 40\u201345\u00b0 for 7 hours. These temperatures must be strictly adhered to; otherwise overheating can occur (Note 11).\nAfter the completion of the decomposition, the solution is boiled for a short time by heating on a steam bath. The cooled solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with 200 ml. of 2N hydrochloric acid and then with three 50-ml. portions of 5N hydrochloric acid. The combined acid extracts are treated with excess ammonia, at which point the indazole precipitates. The mixture is kept in the refrigerator for 2 hours, and the solid is then collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed with water, placed in a beaker covered with a piece of paper, and dried overnight at 100\u2013105\u00b0. The yield of crude, light brown indazole, m.p. 144\u2013147\u00b0, is 36\u201346 g. (36\u201347%) (Note 12). For purification, vacuum distillation in a Claisen flask, modified for distillation of solids, is suitable. This gives 33\u201343 g. of colorless indazole (b.p. 167\u2013176\u00b0/40\u201350 mm.) with a melting point of 148\u00b0 (Note 13)."

(0.35 mole) of 85% potassium hydroxide in 75 ml. of water, followed by 38.7 g. (0.35 mole) of methylisourea hydrochloride (Note 1). The clear liquid is diluted with 150 ml. of acetone, and the resulting suspension, containing finely divided crystalline solid, is treated with 27.0 g. (24 ml., 0.2 mole) of recently distilled phenyl isothiocyanate.\nAfter the additions have been completed, the third neck of the flask is closed and the temperature of the stirred reaction mixture is raised to its boiling point during 15\u201320 minutes, then heating under reflux is continued for 10\u201315 minutes. The contents of the flask, which first change to a greenish yellow clear solution, then later separate into two phases, are kept well mixed by rapid stirring (Note 2). The flask is next disconnected, fitted with a stillhead, and the acetone is distilled rapidly at 25\u201335\u00b0 under reduced pressure. The residual semicrystalline suspension, or two-phase mixture containing the crude product in the upper viscous layer, is carefully stirred onto 300\u2013400 g. of crushed ice. This yields the crude isobiuret as a very pale-yellow granular solid, which is collected by suction filtration, washed with successive small portions of water, drained well, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The dry product is dissolved 120\u2013150 ml. of boiling benzene. Small quantities of suspended yellow powdery material (and possibly droplets of water) are removed by gravity filtration through a heated funnel or by suction filtration through a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel. The clear yellow filtrate deposits large prismatic crystals of 1-phenyl-2-thio-4-methylisobiuret, which are collected by suction filtration at room temperature, washed with a little benzene, and air-dried. The yield of material having a melting point in the range of 122\u2013128\u00b0 is 27\u201331.5 g. (65\u201375%) (Note 3).

The outlet of the condenser is protected from the atmosphere by a T-tube through which a slow stream of nitrogen is passed. The flask is purged with nitrogen, and about 1.5 l. of anhydrous liquid ammonia is either poured or distilled into the flask. A small crushed crystal of ferric nitrate nonahydrate is added, followed by 23 g.

Sodium methylacetylide precipitates as a flocculent gray solid. The solid carbon dioxide is removed from the condenser, and the ammonia is evaporated overnight under a slow stream of nitrogen. A hot water bath may be used to drive off residual ammonia. One liter of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 3) and 500 ml. of anhydrous ether are added, and with rapid stirring a slow stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide from a cylinder is passed into the mixture (Note 4). After 8 hours the rate of absorption of carbon dioxide is very slow. Any solid caked on the inside walls of the flask should be scraped off with the glass paddle stirrer. A very slow flow of carbon dioxide is continued overnight (Note 5).\nThe solvent is removed as completely as possible by distillation on a steam bath under water-pump vacuum. Two hundred milliliters of water is added, and the solid is dissolved by swirling the flask (Note 6). The solution is filtered if suspended solid is present. The aqueous solution is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether. The aqueous layer in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask is then cooled in ice, and a mixture of 70 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 200 g. of ice is added slowly with swirling. The acidified solution is continuously extracted with 200 ml. (or more) of ether for 24\u201336 hours. The extract is evaporated in a stream of air or nitrogen to give tetrolic acid in the form of a mushy tan solid that is further dried in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid for 2 days (Note 7).

            "The apparatus consists of a 200-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with thermometer, reflux condenser, and gas-inlet tube. The flask is charged with 17.8 g. (0.10 mole) of 3-benzoylpropionic acid (Note 1), 10.6 g. (10.6 ml., 0.10 mole) of benzaldehyde, 61.3 g. (57 ml., 0.60 mole) of acetic anhydride, and 8.2 g. (0.10 mole) of powdered anhydrous sodium acetate (freshly fused). The flask is placed in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 95\u2013100\u00b0 and is kept there for 2 hours while dry oxygen-free nitrogen is passed through the reaction mixture (Note 2). At the end of this time the flask is removed from the oil bath, and the hot solution is decanted from the sodium acetate into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The solution is kept at 0\u20135\u00b0 in a refrigerator for 1 hour, during which time \u03b1-benzylidene-\u03b3-phenyl-\u0394\u03b2,\u03b3-butenolide separates as an orange solid.\nAbout 40 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to the contents of the flask, and the butenolide is brought into suspension by thoroughly breaking up all lumps with a spatula. The suspension is filtered with suction, and the filter cake is washed with 30 ml. of cold 95% ethanol and then with 100 ml. of boiling water to remove any sodium acetate present. The butenolide is obtained as a yellow solid, m.p. 149\u2013154\u00b0, weight 11.1\u201312.4 g. (45\u201350%), after being dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator.

The mixture is stirred after the addition of the reactants until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases.\nThe flask is then cooled in ice water, and the contents are filtered with as little suction as possible (Note 3). The filter cake is pressed dry and washed with three 15-ml. portions of tetrachloroethane first used to rinse out the flask. The combined filtrates are dried with a little calcium chloride. Sometimes the solution contains a little bromine; it is removed by adding allyl alcohol dropwise until the bromine color is discharged (usually 0.5\u20131.0 ml. suffices).\nThe solution is decanted into a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask containing a carborundum chip. The material is distilled through a 20-cm. column of glass helices or a 30-cm. spinning-band column. The fore-run boiling below 75\u00b0/760 mm. is bromocyclopropane pure enough for most purposes; weight 9.8\u201311.2 g. (41\u201346%); nD25 1.455\u20131.459; d426 1.506 (Note 4).

After a fore-run of dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane and vinyl acetate is collected at atmospheric pressure, a receiver cooled in solid carbon dioxide and acetone is attached, and crude 2-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate is rapidly distilled by gradually reducing the pressure to about 10 mm. (Note 7). Redistillation through a 30-cm. column packed with glass helices provides 22\u201330 g. (27\u201337%) (Note 8) of the acetate, b.p. 60\u201365\u00b0/100 mm., nD25 1.3916\u20131.3921.",

The apparatus is similar to that described in a previous volume.3 It consists of a \"Vycor\" glass reaction tube, 60 cm. long by 25 mm. outside diameter, mounted vertically in an electric furnace about 35 cm. long (Note 9). Attached to the top of the tube is a graduated dropping funnel. A thermocouple well extending to the center of the heated section is inserted through the bottom of the tube. The heated section of the tube is packed with quartz tubing (8 mm. outside diameter), cut into 0.5-cm. lengths, and held in place by indentations in the tube. Ten centimeters from the bottom of the tube is a side arm leading successively to two traps cooled with solid carbon dioxide and acetone, an inlet tube for nitrogen, a manometer, and a vacuum pump.\nThe system is evacuated to a pressure of 5\u201310 mm., and the tube is heated to 700\u00b0, measured at the center of the heated zone. 2-Chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate is admitted at the rate of 10\u201320 g. per hour. From 70 g. (0.35 mole) of the cyclobutyl acetate there is obtained 62\u201368 g. of mixed solid and liquid condensate (Note 10).

The mixture is heated under reflux until all the salt dissolves (about 15 minutes). The solution is cooled to 130\u00b0, 610 ml. (10 moles) of 82% hydrazine hydrate is added through the reflux condenser, and the mixture is refluxed for 4 hours (Note 5).\nPotassium hydroxide (168 g., 3.0 moles) is dissolved in 400 ml. of triethanolamine by heating the mixture to boiling in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask (about 15 minutes is required). At the end of the reflux period, the hot reaction mixture is transferred to a good hood if it is not already in one, the condenser is removed, and the hot potassium hydroxide solution is added cautiously but rapidly to the stirred reaction mixture (Note 6). The open reaction mixture is at least two-thirds immersed in the oil bath to help prevent foaming over and is heated strongly and rapidly in order to drive off water and excess hydrazine hydrate. After 2\u20133 hours the temperature inside the flask reaches about 140\u00b0, and decomposition of the bis-hydrazone begins, with evolution of nitrogen and considerable foaming. Foaming over is prevented by judicious regulation of the heating, good stirring, and occasional addition of a little silicone oil, which is a good antifoaming agent (Note 7). The temperature is raised as rapidly as possible to 195\u00b0 (about 2 hours is needed) and held at this temperature for 6 hours. The final oil bath temperature is 200\u2013220\u00b0.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to about 100\u00b0 (Note 5), washed out of the flask with 5 l. of hot water (Note 8), and acidified to a pH between 2 and 3 with 1.4 l. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the docosanedioic acid that has precipitated is collected on a 25-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible (Note 9). The filter cake is suspended in 5 l. of water with mechanical stirring and collected on the B\u00fcchner funnel as before. The moist filter cake is dissolved in 700 ml. of hot 2-methoxyethanol, the hot solution is filtrate through a fluted paper in a heated funnel, and the filtrate is gradually cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0.

            "A. Potassium salt of ethyl o-nitrophenylpyruvate. Anhydrous ether (300 ml.) is placed in a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a motor-driven stirrer (with seal), and a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube. Freshly cut potassium (39.1 g., 1.00 g. atom) is added. Caution! Follow the precautions for handling potassium described in an earlier volume.2\nA slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask above the surface of the stirred liquid, and a mixture of 250 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol and 200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added from the dropping funnel just fast enough to maintain mild boiling. When all the potassium has dissolved (Note 1), the nitrogen is shut off. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, and 2.5 l. of anhydrous ether is added. Diethyl oxalate (146 g., 1.00 mole) is added with stirring, followed after 10 minutes by 137 g. (1.00 mole) of o-nitrotoluene. Stirring is discontinued after an additional 10 minutes, and the mixture is poured, with the aid of a connecting tube, into a 5-l. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is stoppered and set aside for at least 24 hours. The lumpy deep-purple potassium salt of ethyl o-nitrophenylpyruvate is separated by filtration (Note 2) and washed with anhydrous ether until the filtrate remains colorless. The yield of the air-dried salt is 204\u2013215 g. (74\u201378%).",
            "B. Ethyl indole-2-carboxylate. Thirty grams (0.109 mole) of the potassium salt is placed in a 400-ml. hydrogenation bottle and dissolved by addition of 200 ml. of glacial acetic acid, producing a yellow, opaque solution (Note 3). Platinum catalyst3 (0.20 g.) is added, the bottle is placed in a Parr low-pressure hydrogenation apparatus, and the system is flushed several times with hydrogen. With the initial reading on the pressure gauge about 30 p.s.i., the bottle is shaken until hydrogen uptake ceases and then for an additional 1\u20132 hours (Note 4). The catalyst is removed by filtration and washed with glacial acetic acid. The filtrate is placed in a 4-l. beaker, and 3 l. of water is added slowly with stirring. Ethyl indole-2-carboxylate precipitates as a yellow solid. It is separated by filtration, washed with five 100-ml. portions of water, and dried over calcium chloride in a desiccator. It weighs 13.2\u201313.6 g. (64\u201366%; 47\u201351% based on o-nitrotoluene); m.p. 118\u2013124\u00b0.\nThe dried ether can be further purified by treatment with charcoal and recrystallization from a mixture of methylene chloride and light petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201368\u00b0).

            "A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, an inlet for dry nitrogen, and a mechanical stirrer is flushed with dry nitrogen. It is then charged with 340 g. (4.00 moles) of piperidine (Note 1) 4.4 g. (0.19 g. atom) of sodium, and 5.0 g. (5.1 ml., 0.063 mole) of pyridine (Note 2). While a slow stream of nitrogen continues to pass through the flask, the solution is heated under reflux with high-speed stirring for approximately 10 minutes. During this time most of the sodium reacts without evolution of hydrogen, and the dispersion darkens. The dispersion, which contains some finely divided solids, is cooled and transferred to a 2-l. stirred autoclave (Note 3) under nitrogen. An additional 85 g. (1.00 mole) of piperidine is used to wash the last portions of the dispersion into the autoclave.\nThe autoclave is pressured with ethylene (Note 2) to 400 lb./in.2 with stirring (Note 4). It is then heated to 100\u00b0 with stirring, which causes the pressure to rise to about 555 lb./in.2. It is maintained at 100\u00b0 with stirring until a gradual drop in pressure ceases; this usually takes about 2.5 hours, but it may take as long as 10 hours (Note 5). The autoclave is cooled to room temperature, and the excess ethylene is vented. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, the autoclave is rinsed with 100 ml. of methanol that is added to the flask, and the mixture is fractionated through a 90-cm. column packed with glass helices.

            "A. 5-(p-Hydroxybenzal)hydantoin. An intimate mixture of 6.11 g. (0.050 mole) of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Note 1) and 5.5 g. (0.055 mole) of hydantoin (Note 2) is placed in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask. Dry piperidine (10 ml.) is added, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube is fitted to the flask, and the flask is immersed in an oil bath so that the level of the reaction mixture is the same as the oil level of the bath. The oil bath is heated slowly to 130\u00b0 and is held at this temperature for 30 minutes; foaming and gentle boiling occur. The reaction mixture is cooled, and 200 ml. of water at about 60\u00b0 is added. The contents of the flask are stirred by means of a glass rod until a clear red solution is obtained (Note 3). Any traces of tarry material are removed by filtration. The solution is cooled to room temperature, transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and acidified by dropwise addition of 20 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture stands at room temperature a few hours, and then the yellow precipitate of 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed thoroughly with cold water (Note 4). After being dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide, the crude hydantoin weighs 8.5\u20138.8 g. (83\u201386%). It melts at 310\u2013315\u00b0 (dec.) and is sufficiently pure for the next step and other preparative purposes (Note 5).",
            "B. p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid. Crude 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin (8.5 g., 0.042 mole) and a few chips of porous plate are placed in a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a gas-inlet tube (Note 6). A slow stream of oxygen-free nitrogen (Note 7) is introduced. As soon as the air has been swept out of the apparatus, 240 ml. of 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (w/v) is added through the dropping funnel. The mixture is boiled for 3 hours in an oil bath at 170\u2013180\u00b0 (Note 8). The 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin dissolves rapidly, and a clear orange solution is obtained that becomes less deeply colored during the reaction. The reaction mixture is cooled by replacing the oil bath by a bath of cold water. Without interrupting the stream of nitrogen, 100 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that foaming and heating of the mixture are not excessive. The flask is disconnected, and 5 g. of sodium bicarbonate is dissolved in the mixture (Note 9).\nThe liquid is transferred to a continuous extractor (Note 10) and extracted with ether until the supernatant layer of ether remains colorless (about 2 hours). The ethereal extract is discarded (Note 11). The aqueous solution is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and acidified by the cautious addition of 60 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid (Note 12). The solution is returned to the extractor, which is attached to a tared round-bottomed flask. The solution is extracted with ether until no more p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid is obtained (Note 13). The undried ether solution is evaporated to dryness on a boiling water bath to give crude p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid as a pale-yellow crystalline mass. The mass is broken up with a spatula, and the flask is kept over potassium hydroxide in a vacuum desiccator until its weight is constant. The yield of crude acid is 6.9\u20137.2 g. (92\u201396%). It melts at 210\u2013215\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 14).\nTwelve milliliters of water for each gram of the crude acid (83\u201386 ml.) is added to the flask, which is then attached to a reflux condenser and immersed in an oil bath at 150\u00b0. After 10\u201320 minutes of boiling, a clear pale-yellow solution is obtained. This is filtered through a fluted filter into an Erlenmeyer flask. After crystallization has started, 8.3\u20138.6 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid (1.2 ml. of acid for each gram of crude acid) is added, and the mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, during which period it is occasionally agitated. Crystallization is completed by keeping the flask in a refrigerator for at least 10 hours. The product is separated by suction filtration and washed with a small amount of ice water. The purified p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid weighs 4.4\u20134.7 g. (59\u201363%) and melts at 216\u2013218\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 14) and (Note 15)."

After completion of the addition, the flask is protected by a drying tube, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature under a hood for 3 days. During this period, the color of the mixture changes from deep yellow through brown to black.\nThe flask is fitted with a Claisen head, and excess thionyl chloride is distilled at reduced pressure (water pump) and collected in a receiver cooled in a mixture of dry ice and acetone (Note 5). The flask is heated with a water bath that is slowly raised from room temperature to about 90\u00b0, then held at that temperature until no more distillation occurs and a black residue remains.\nThe black residue is cooled to 0\u00b0, and 100 ml. of ice-cold ethanol is added very cautiously to react with residual thionyl chloride. An additional 400 ml. of ice-cold ethanol is added, and the solid mass left at the bottom of the flask is broken up with the aid of a rod (Note 2). The resultant light-brown powder is collected by suction filtration, preferably on a sintered glass funnel, and washed with five 150-ml. portions of ethanol.

This solid is now continuously extracted with absolute ethanol for 24 hours in a Soxhlet apparatus. The alcohol is distilled from the extract on a steam bath, and the crude sodium 4-pyridinesulfonate is dissolved in about 160 ml. of hot water. After 320 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid has been added with mixing, the solution is cooled to room temperature. The precipitate of sodium chloride is filtered, and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a steam bath.

The modest heat of reaction requires the application of some heat throughout the reaction period in order to maintain reflux. After the addition is completed, the solution is heated at the reflux temperature for an additional 30 minutes (Caution!

(3.0 moles) of 2-aminopyridine (Note 1) in 500 ml. of acetic acid. The solution is cooled to below 20\u00b0 by immersion in an ice bath, and 480 g. (154 ml., 3.0 moles) of bromine dissolved in 300 ml. of acetic acid is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a period of 1 hour. Initially the temperature is maintained below 20\u00b0, but after about half the bromine solution has been added it is allowed to rise to 50\u00b0 to delay as long as possible the separation of the hydrobromide of 2-amino-5-bromopyridine. At 50\u00b0 the hydrobromide usually begins to crystallize when about three-quarters of the bromine has been added. When addition of bromine is completed, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour and is then diluted with 750 ml. of water to dissolve the hydrobromide. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 5-l. beaker and are neutralized, with stirring and cooling, by the addition of 1.2 l. of 40% sodium hydroxide solution.\nThe precipitated 2-amino-5-bromopyridine, contaminated with some 2-amino-3,5-dibromopyridine, is collected by filtration and, after washing with water until the washings are free of ionic bromide, is dried at 110\u00b0 (Note 2). The 2-amino-3,5-dibromopyridine is removed from the product by washing with three 500-ml. portions (Note 3) of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201380\u00b0). The yield of 2-amino-5-bromopyridine, m.p. 132\u2013135\u00b0, sufficiently pure for use in the next stage, is 320\u2013347 g. (62\u201367%) (Note 4) and (Note 5).",

(0.5 mole) of 2-amino-5-bromopyridine is added at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 5\u00b0. Twenty-six milliliters (39 g., 0.57 mole) of 95% nitric acid is added dropwise with stirring at 0\u00b0, and the mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0 for 1 hour, at room temperature for 1 hour, and at 50\u201360\u00b0 for 1 hour. The contents of the flask are cooled and poured onto 5 l. of ice and neutralized with 1350 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide solution.

The mixture is heated on a steam bath (Note 11) for 1 hour, and at the end of this period the iron is removed by filtration and is washed three times with 10-ml. portions of hot 95% ethanol. The filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness, and the dark residue is recrystallized from 50 ml. of water, 1 g. of activated carbon being used and the mixture being filtered while hot. The charcoal is washed with hot ethanol to avoid losses. 2,3-Diamino-5-bromopyridine crystallizes as colorless needles, m.p. 163\u00b0. The yield is 6.5\u20137.1 g. (69\u201376%).",

When absorption of hydrogen is completed, the catalyst is removed by filtration, and, after saturation with potassium carbonate (about 330 g. is required), the resulting slushy mixture is extracted continuously with ether until all the precipitate completely disappears (usually about 18 hours, but this depends on the efficiency of the extraction apparatus). The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue of crude 2,3-diaminopyridine is recrystallized from benzene (about 600 ml. is required) using 3 g. of activated charcoal and filtering rapidly through a preheated B\u00fcchner funnel.

            "Five hundred forty-five grams (4.00 moles) of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Note 1) is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 90-cm. Vigreux column, and dropping funnel (not of the pressure-equalizing variety). The Vigreux column must extend sufficiently into the top of a well-ventilated hood to entrain effectively the fumes that will be generated later in the operation. The phenol is melted with the aid of an external oil bath or Glascol\u00ae heating mantle and heated to about 100\u00b0. The heating bath is removed, and 27.6 g. (1.20 g. atoms) of sodium in cubes about 1 cm. on a side or smaller is added to the stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 150\u2013160\u00b0. The molten mass gradually becomes dark red in color as the sodium dissolves. While the addition and solution of the sodium is proceeding, a cold solution of about 0.25 mole of chloramine in 250 ml. of ether is prepared (Note 2).\nWhen all the sodium has dissolved, the phenoxide-phenol mixture is heated to 150\u00b0. With the oil bath or heating mantle still surrounding the flask, and with a protective shield between the reaction vessel and the operator (Note 3), the cold ethereal chloramine solution is added with rapid stirring in a thin stream from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not drop below 125\u00b0. Best results are obtained if the thin stream of ether solution can be added directly to the molten mass without first touching the walls of the flask.\nWhen the addition is completed, the heat source is removed and the dark-colored contents are allowed to cool until another 0.25 mole of ethereal chloramine has been prepared and is ready for use; a wait of 1.5\u20132 hours between chloramine additions is convenient but not essential to the success of the experiment. The cooled reaction mixture is then reheated to 150\u00b0, and the process is repeated. This sequence is repeated until a total of four 0.25-mole portions of chloramine are added.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool. The dropping funnel, thermometer, and Vigreux column are replaced with a stopper and short-path distillation head. The mixture is stirred while the excess phenol is removed by distillation at water-aspirator pressure; b.p. 105\u2013110\u00b0 (14 mm.). When the temperature begins to rise above 110\u00b0 (14 mm.), the distillation is stopped and the residue is allowed to cool (Note 4).\nWater (500 ml.) and 500 ml. of ether are added to the residue, and the mixture is well stirred. The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the two layers are carefully separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two additional 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed twice with 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The dark residue is transferred to a distillation flask and distilled through a 30-cm. Vigreux column to yield a crystalline fraction, b.p. 130\u2013155\u00b0 (13 mm.) (Note 5). Recrystallization of this distillate from ligroin gives 68\u201380 g.

In the preparation of this reagent commercial anhydrous liquid ammonia (500 ml.) is introduced from a cylinder through an inlet tube. To the stirred ammonia is added a small piece of clean lithium metal. After the appearance of a blue color a few crystals of ferric nitrate hydrate (about 0.25 g.) are added, followed by small pieces of freshly cut lithium metal (Note 2) until 1.73 g. has been added. After all the lithium has been converted to the amide (Note 3), 17.6 g. (0.2 mole) of ethyl acetate (Note 4) is added, and the gray suspension is stirred for about 30 seconds. To the gray suspension is added 36.4 g. (0.2 mole) of benzophenone (Note 4) dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous ether. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and is then neutralized by the addition of 13.4 g. (0.25 mole) of ammonium chloride. The liquid ammonia is then removed by use of a steam bath while 200\u2013300 ml. of ether is being added (Note 5). When the ammonia has been removed, 200 ml. of cold water is added. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is further extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is evaporated.

            "A. Triethyl oxalylsuccinate. In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride drying tube is placed 356 ml. (276 g., 6.00 moles) of anhydrous ethanol (Note 1). Sodium (23 g., 1.0 g. atom) is added in small portions at a rate sufficient to keep the ethanol boiling. External heating is required to dissolve the last portions of the metal. After all the sodium has dissolved, the excess ethanol is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure; as the mixture becomes pasty, dry toluene is added in sufficient amounts to permit stirring and to prevent splattering of the salt. Distillation and addition of toluene is continued until all the ethanol is removed and the contents of the flask reach a temperature of 105\u00b0 (Note 2). The sodium ethoxide slurry is cooled to room temperature and 650 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, followed by 146 g. (1.00 mole) of diethyl oxalate. To the yellow solution there is added 174 g. (1.00 mole) of diethyl succinate, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 12 hours.\nThe mixture is hydrolyzed by the addition of 500 ml. of water with stirring. The layers are separated, the ether layer is washed with 150 ml. of water, and the ether layer is discarded. The combined aqueous layers are acidified with 100 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid, and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of ether, which are added to the oily layer. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the ether is removed by evaporation under water-pump pressure at a bath temperature of 35\u201345\u00b0. Triethyl oxalylsuccinate, a yellow oil weighing 235\u2013250 g. (86\u201391%), remains in the flask (Note 3).",

The dark-brown damp acid is converted to the ammonium salt by repeated extraction with hot dilute ammonium hydroxide (1 part by volume of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and 2 parts of water) followed by decantation. The combined decanted solutions are treated with Norit\u00ae while still hot, filtered, and then strongly acidified while still hot with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitated acid is digested for at least several hours (Note 4). After the suspension has been cooled, the crude brown-colored acid is removed by filtration, washed with cold water, and air-dried to give 113 g. (77%) of product. The crude acid is recrystallized from 900 ml. of 50% aqueous methanol to yield 95 g. (65%) of tan-colored needles, m.p. 202\u2013206\u00b0 (Note 5)."

(0.30 mole) of benzoic acid (Note 3) in 86.5 g. (0.90 mole) of methanesulfonic acid (Note 4) in a 500-ml. tall-form beaker. The reaction temperature is maintained at 25\u201330\u00b0 by means of an ice-water bath. The reaction is exothermic during the hydrogen peroxide addition, which requires approximately 30 minutes. During this period the benzoic acid completely dissolves.\nThe solution is stirred for an additional 2 hours and is then cooled to 15\u00b0. Fifty grams of chopped ice and 75 ml. of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution are cautiously added in sequence while the temperature is maintained below 25\u00b0 during the dilution (Note 5). The contents of the beaker are transferred to a separatory funnel, and the peroxybenzoic acid solution is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of benzene at room temperature (Note 6). The aqueous layer is discarded, and the combined benzene extracts are washed twice with 15 ml. of cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution to ensure complete removal of methanesulfonic acid and hydrogen peroxide, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Iodometric titration of an aliquot of the benzene solution (Note 7) indicates that the conversion of benzoic to peroxybenzoic acid is 85\u201390%. This solution can be used directly for epoxidation or other oxidation reactions without further treatment (Note 8)."

The flask is charged with 453 g. (3.1 moles) of silver difluoride (Note 2) and 500 ml. of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (Note 3), and phenyl disulfide (100 g., 0.458 mole) (Note 4) is weighed into the solid addition funnel. The stirrer is started, and phenyl disulfide is added to the slurry in small portions. An exothermic reaction occurs, and after the addition of several portions the reaction mixture reaches a temperature of 40\u00b0 (Note 5). By intermittent use of a cooling bath and by adjusting the rate of addition of the disulfide, the reaction temperature may be maintained between 35\u00b0 and 40\u00b0. The addition of the phenyl disulfide requires 45\u201360 minutes. On completion of the addition the suspension of black silver difluoride has been converted to yellow silver monofluoride, and the exothermic reaction gradually subsides. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15\u201330 minutes without external cooling and then quickly heated to reflux.\nThe reaction mixture is filtered hot through a fluted filter paper under a blanket of dry nitrogen into a dry, 1-l., round-bottomed flask. The residue of solid silver fluoride is washed with a total of 500 ml. of boiling 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane in portions (Note 6). The filtrates are combined and distilled through a short Vigreux column, an oil bath not heated over 70\u00b0 being used (Note 7). The residue of phenylsulfur trifluoride is transferred to a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask and distilled, b.p. 47\u201348\u00b0 (2.6 mm.), through a Claisen-type distillation column, discarding a small fore-run. The product is obtained in a yield of 84\u201392 g. (55\u201360%) as a colorless liquid, m.p. \u221210\u00b0 (Note 8). Since phenylsulfur trifluoride slowly attacks Pyrex\u00ae glass, it should be used immediately. It can be stored for several days in glass at \u221280\u00b0 or in polyethylene, however, and may be stored indefinitely at room temperature in bottles of Teflon\u00ae polytetrafluoroethylene resin or aluminum (Note 9)."

The mixture is placed in an agitated 2-l. hydrogenation autoclave and hydrogenated at 90\u00b0 under an initial pressure of 100 atm. (Note 4). Slightly more than the calculated amount of hydrogen (3 moles) is absorbed within 30\u201360 minutes. The mixture is cooled to 25\u00b0, and the catalyst is separated by filtration and washed with 100 ml. of ethanol. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness under water-aspirator vacuum at a bath temperature of 50\u201360\u00b0. The residue, semicrystalline 1-carbethoxymethyl-4-carbethoxypiperidine hydrobromide, is taken up in 500 ml. of ice-cold water. The solution is added to 500 ml. of chloroform in a 5-l. beaker immersed in an ice bath, and an ice-cold solution of 150 g. of potassium carbonate in 250 ml. of water is added gradually with stirring (Note 5). After the carbon dioxide evolution has subsided, the mixture is placed in a 2-l. separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken for some time. The lower, organic layer is drawn off and washed once with 200 ml. of water. The aqueous layers are combined and washed once with 500 ml. of chloroform.

            "C. 3-Quinuclidone hydrochloride. A 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a Hershberg stirrer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a condenser connected to a source of dry nitrogen. Absolute toluene (330 ml.) and 80 g. (2.05 g. atom) of potassium free of oxide crust are added. (Caution! Directions3 for the safe handling of potassium should be consulted.) The air in the flask is replaced by an atmosphere of dry nitrogen that is maintained until the reaction mixture is decomposed. The flask is heated in an oil bath until the toluene begins to reflux gently. As soon as the potassium is molten, it is pulverized by vigorous stirring. One hundred twenty-five milliliters (98.6 g., 2.14 moles) of absolute ethanol (Note 6) is added through the addition funnel within 30 minutes while heating and stirring are continued. After disappearance of the potassium the temperature is raised to 130\u00b0, and a solution of 200 g. (0.822 mole) of 1-carbethoxymethyl-4-carbethoxypiperidine in 500 ml. of absolute toluene is added within 2 hours. The mixture is stirred and heated for an additional 3 hours.\nThe resulting solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 and decomposed by careful addition of 500 ml. of 10N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous phase is separated, and the toluene layer is extracted with two 250-ml. portions of 10N hydrochloric acid. The aqueous extracts are combined and heated under reflux for 15 hours to effect decarboxylation. The hot, dark-colored solution is treated with 10 g. of activated charcoal, filtered, and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue is washed into a separatory funnel with 300 ml. of water. The solution is treated with saturated aqueous potassium carbonate solution until it is alkaline to litmus; the carbonate solution must be added very carefully to prevent excessive foaming. Solid potassium carbonate is added until a thin slurry is obtained, and the slurry is extracted with four 400-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried for at least 60 minutes over calcined potassium carbonate and then filtered.\nThe ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath through a column filled with Raschig rings. The yellowish crystalline residue is treated with 150 g. of ice and 150 g. (130 ml.) of 10N hydrochloric acid, and the solution is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (Note 7). The crystalline residue is dissolved in the minimum amount of hot water (about 70 ml.), and boiling isopropyl alcohol (about 1.5 l.) is added until crystalline 3-quinuclidone hydrochloride begins to separate. The mixture is cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0, and the solid is separated by filtration, washed with acetone, and dried.

A 1-l. four-necked flask (or a three-necked flask with a Y-tube connection) is outfitted with a Trubore\u00ae stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask, and a reflux condenser in whose outlet is placed a T-tube, one side of which leads to a bubble counter and the other is connected to a source of pure nitrogen. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and a suspension of 23 g. (1.0 mole) of sodium in 350 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 1) and (Note 2) is prepared in the flask. There is then added dropwise with stirring 73.0 g. (1.1 moles) of freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (Note 3). As the exothermic reaction begins, evolution of hydrogen through the bubble counter can be observed immediately. The temperature of the reaction mixture should be kept below 35\u201340\u00b0 by intermittent cooling of the flask with an ice bath. At the end of the reaction the color of the solution should be a pale rose; exposure to air causes a rapid change in color to dark brown (Note 4).",
            "B. 4,6,8-Trimethylazulene. Caution! 2,4,6-Trimethylpyrylium perchlorate is explosive. Operations with it should be conducted behind a shield. The arrangements of the reaction flask used in the preparation of cyclopentadienylsodium are now altered for the next step. While increasing the nitrogen flow rate strongly, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a wide-mouthed powder funnel. The strong flow of pure nitrogen coming out of the flask and around the powder funnel prevents the atmosphere from diffusing into the flask to any appreciable extent. Then, with strong stirring of the reaction mixture, 142 g. (0.64 mole) of 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium perchlorate (Caution! Moistened with dry tetrahydrofuran, (Note 5)) is added in small portions through the powder funnel at such a rate that the immediate exothermic reaction which ensues maintains the temperature of the reaction mixture between 42\u00b0 and, at most, 48\u00b0. The color of the reaction mixture turns purple immediately on addition of the 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium perchlorate. Usually the addition requires about 1 hour; then the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 minutes. The powder funnel is replaced with a stopper, the condenser is turned downward for distillation, and about 130 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is removed by distillation while stirring is continued. For the distillation the flask is heated on a steam bath, and the temperature of the reaction mixture at the end of the distillation is about 68\u201370\u00b0. The color of the distillate is a weak violet owing to the co-distillation of a small amount of 4,6,8-trimethylazulene. After the reaction mixture has cooled, it is transferred to a 3-l. separatory funnel and diluted, first with 75 ml. of methanol and then with 1 l. of water. This causes the separation of a dark violet oil which is taken up in 400 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) and separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous layer is extracted again with 200 ml. of fresh petroleum ether, and the combined petroleum ether extracts are washed five times with 175-ml. portions of water. Since a small quantity of a greasy by-product separates at the interface during the washing with water, the petroleum ether extract, after the final washing, is purified by passing it through a B\u00fcchner funnel lined with asbestos fibers as a filtering aid. After the filtrate has been dried over calcium chloride, the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is carefully freed of solvent by heating on a steam bath under reduced pressure for 4 hours.\nThe crude product is then transferred to an apparatus suitable for distillation of solids (Note 6), and this is joined to a high-vacuum system capable of a vacuum in the range of 10\u22125 mm. Distillation begins when the bath temperature reaches about 190\u00b0; a boiling point of around 120\u00b0 is usually observed. When the distillate first begins to appear brown rather than violet, the distillation is stopped immediately (Note 7). The crystalline distillate (ca. 70 g.) is dissolved in 20 ml. of hot ethanol, filtered while hot, and allowed to cool. The solid (about 60 g. of crystals, m.p. 74\u201376\u00b0) is recrystallized from 20 ml. of ethanol to yield 47\u201353 g. (43\u201349%) of 4,6,8-trimethylazulene as dark-violet plates, m.p. 80\u201381\u00b0 (Note 8)."

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 2-l. four-necked flask (or a three-necked flask with a Y-tube connection) outfitted with a stirrer, a short reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask, 148 g. (2.0 moles) of anhydrous t-butyl alcohol and 1020 g. (945 ml., 10.0 moles) of acetic anhydride are mixed with stirring and cooled to \u221210\u00b0 by means of an ice-salt cooling bath. Then 250 g. (150 ml., 1.75 moles) of 70% perchloric acid is added rapidly from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture over a period of 5\u20137 minutes (Note 2). With the first few drops a vigorous reaction begins which is manifested by evolution of fumes, coloration of the reaction mixture to orange and then reddish brown, and a rapid rise in temperature. When the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 40\u201350\u00b0, crystals of 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium perchlorate should begin to separate (Note 3); then the temperature is allowed to rise to 100\u00b0. The rate of perchloric acid introduction and the use of the cooling bath are then so controlled that the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained between 100\u00b0 and 105\u00b0. Toward the end of the addition the perchloric acid may be added quite rapidly and the desired temperature may still be maintained. After all the perchloric acid has been added, the cooling bath is removed and stirring of the mixture is continued. The temperature remains at about 90\u00b0 for 10 or 15 minutes and then falls to about 75\u00b0 after 30 minutes. The dark-brown stirred mixture is cooled once again until the temperature has fallen to 15\u00b0. The crystalline 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium perchlorate, which has separated, is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and is washed on the funnel with a 1:1 mixture of acetic acid and ether and then washed twice with ether (Note 4). Suction is stopped before the crystals are dry. The product can be air-dried to give 195\u2013210 g. (50\u201354%) of yellow crystals, m.p. 244\u00b0 dec. (Note 1), (Note 5), and (Note 6). For storing or for use in the preparation of 4,6,8-trimethylazulene, however, it is best to place the product in a cork-stoppered flask and moisten it with dry tetrahydrofuran.",
            "In a 2-l. four-necked flask (or a three-necked flask with a Y-tube connector) equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer extending nearly to the bottom of the flask is placed 550 ml. (595 g., 5.83 moles) of acetic anhydride which is cooled to 0\u00b0 with an ice-salt bath. Then 180 ml. (300 g., 2.09 moles) of a 70% solution of perchloric acid is added with stirring at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above 8\u00b0 (Note 1). This step takes about 3 hours. The mixture is continually cooled and stirred, and 240 ml. (204 g., 2.09 moles) of mesityl oxide is then added slowly. The slow addition of 370 ml. (400 g., 3.92 moles) of acetic anhydride follows. The ice bath is then replaced by a water bath; the temperature of the reaction mixture will usually rise to 50\u201370\u00b0 because of the heat liberated by the exothermic reaction, and the reaction mixture will turn dark. The reaction mixture is heated on a steam bath for 15 minutes to complete the reaction, and the mixture is then allowed to cool and stand at room temperature for 2 hours. The crystals, which have separated from the brown solution, are collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and are washed on the funnel twice with 100-ml. portions of acetic acid, twice with 100-ml. portions of absolute ethanol, and twice with 100-ml. portions of absolute ether. This gives 250\u2013260 g. (54\u201356%) of pale-yellow to light-brown crystals, m.p. 240\u00b0 dec. (Note 2). For storage the crystals should be transferred, without drying, to an ordinary flask, moistened with dry tetrahydrofuran, and then kept in this state by stoppering the flask with an ordinary cork (Note 3)."

            "Hydrogen fluoride (50 g., 2.5 moles) is distilled from the cylinder through a polyethylene tube into a 250-ml. polyethylene transfer bottle which has been previously weighed and calibrated. A vent is provided during this process by inserting a large-gauge hypodermic needle through the bottle cap. No provision against atmospheric moisture is necessary. The bottle is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath, and 45\u201350 ml. of liquid hydrogen fluoride is collected. The amount of liquid obtained can be determined by weight difference; however, since an excess of hydrogen fluoride is employed, the exact weight need not be determined. The time required for collection of the hydrogen fluoride can be appreciably shortened by placing the cylinder in a pan of warm water.\nThe reaction itself is carried out in a 1-l. polyolefin bottle (Note 2) or fused silica flask (Note 3) fitted with an inlet tube (Note 4) leading to the bottom of the reaction vessel and a reflux condenser which is connected to a hydrogen chloride absorber or which leads directly to the hood. A condenser suitable for work with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride can easily be prepared from a glass-jacketed polyolefin, Teflon\u00ae, silica, or copper tube (Note 5).\nBenzoyl chloride (281 g., 2.0 moles) is placed in the reaction vessel, and the hydrogen fluoride gas is then introduced by its distillation from the transfer bottle through the inlet tube. Prior to this distillation the hypodermic needle is closed off by a metal cap. The hydrogen fluoride is added over a period of approximately 1 hour. Generally, external cooling is not needed, as the evaporating hydrogen chloride cools the reaction mixture. When the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is warmed to 30\u201340\u00b0 and kept at this temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is then washed in an ordinary glass separatory funnel (Note 6) with 500 ml. of ice water in which 12.5 g. (0.2 mole) of boric acid is dissolved (Note 7). The organic layer is quickly separated, and to it are added 10 g. of anhydrous sodium fluoride and 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate (Note 7). The mixture is allowed to stand for 30 minutes and is then filtered and distilled through a short Vigreux column. The yield of benzoyl fluoride b.p. 159\u2013161\u00b0, n15D 1.4988 (Note 8), is 187\u2013200 g. (75\u201380%)."

A dry 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a Vibromischer stirrer (Note 1), a reflux condenser, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing side tube.2 A nitrogen-inlet tube is connected to the top of the dropping funnel, and an outlet tube is placed on the top of the condenser and connected to a mercury valve. The latter consists of a U-tube the bend of which is just filled with mercury.\nTo the flask are added 13.4 g. (0.58 mole) of clean sodium and 200 ml. of absolute toluene. The Vibromischer stirrer is activated, the toluene heated to reflux, and the agitation continued at this temperature until all the sodium is pulverized into a very fine sand. The agitation is ceased, and the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The nitrogen flow rate is increased, the Vibromischer stirrer is replaced with a conventional sealed mechanical stirrer with a Teflon\u00ae blade, and a solution of 85 g. (0.6 mole) of 2-carbomethoxycyclopentanone (Note 2) in 450 ml. of absolute benzene is placed in the addition funnel.\nThe stirrer is started, and the solution in the addition funnel is added over a 2-hour period without external heating (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated under reflux for 2.5 hours, at the end of which time the mixture has a pasty consistency. A solution of 106 g. (0.84 mole) of benzyl chloride in 100 ml. of dry benzene is added in one portion, the mixture heated under reflux for 14 hours, and the solution (Note 4) poured into 600 ml. of water. The benzene layer is separated, the aqueous layer extracted twice with ether, and the combined benzene-ether extract washed with 100 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid distilled to yield 108\u2013116 g.

As soon as all the lithium iodide has dissolved (Note 9), 30 g. (0.129 mole) of 2-benzyl-2-carbomethoxycyclopentanone dissolved in 30 ml. of 2,4,6-collidine (Note 10) is added to the boiling, faintly yellow solution; and during this process the solution turns darker in color and a precipitate forms (Note 11). Evolution of carbon dioxide begins immediately, and its formation can be followed by passing the nitrogen flush through a saturated barium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated under reflux and a nitrogen atmosphere for 19 hours, at the end of which time the evolution of carbon dioxide is very slow (Note 12).\nThe mixture is cooled and poured onto a mixture of 200 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, 200 ml. of ether, and 100 g. of ice.

The reaction mixture turns into a deep-red turbid solution within a few minutes, and then suddenly a heavy yellow precipitate of ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate separates. To the mixture 15 ml. of water is added, and stirring is continued for 1 hour. The mixture is filtered with suction, and the residue is washed with two 30-ml. portions of a 3% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and with two 15-ml. portions of 96% ethanol.\nThe ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate obtained is transferred immediately to a 1-l. beaker fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. Water (250 ml.) is added, and the temperature is raised to 30\u00b0. A solution of 28.4 g. (0.30 mole) of chloroacetic acid in 30 ml. of water is neutralized with sodium carbonate [18.6 g. (0.15 mole) of Na2CO3\u00b7H2O in 70 ml. of water] and is added to the well-stirred dithiocarbamate suspension over a 10-minute period (Note 3). In the beginning the suspension gradually becomes less viscous, but at the end of the addition it rapidly turns into a creamy mass. Another 250 ml. of water is added to facilitate stirring, which is continued for 1 hour after the addition at about 30\u00b0.\nThe creamy suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the electrodes of a pH meter are inserted (Note 4). A solution of 20.5 g. (0.15 mole) of zinc chloride (Note 5) in 75 ml. of water is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a period of 45 minutes, while the pH is maintained at 7 by the simultaneous dropwise addition of a 4N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (Note 6).

            "A. 2,5-Dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione. A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding small pieces of sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) as rapidly as possible to 900 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol contained in a 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two stoppers and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube packed with calcium chloride and soda lime. The reaction is completed by heating the mixture under reflux for 3\u20134 hours (Note 1). To the hot solution is added diethyl succinate (348.4 g., 2 moles) (Note 2) in one portion (Caution! Exothermic reaction), and the mixture is heated under reflux by maintaining the original bath temperature for 24 hours. A thick pink-colored precipitate is formed almost immediately and remains throughout the reaction.\nAt the end of the 24-hour period, the ethanol is removed under reduced pressure on a steam bath. A 2N sulfuric acid solution (2 l.) is added to the warm residue, and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 3\u20134 hours (Note 3). The solid is removed by suction filtration and washed several times with water. The air-dried product is a pale-buff powder weighing 180\u2013190 g., m.p. 126\u2013128\u00b0. The solid is added to 1.5 l. of ethyl acetate, the mixture is heated to boiling and is filtered rapidly while hot (Note 4). The filtrate is chilled, and it yields cream to pink-cream colored crystals of 2,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione, 160\u2013168 g., m.p. 126.5\u2013128.5\u00b0. The filtrate is concentrated to one-tenth of its original volume in order to obtain a second crop of crystals, 5\u20137 g., m.p. 121\u2013125\u00b0. The total yield is 165\u2013175 g. (64\u201368%).",
            "B. 1,4-Cyclohexanedione. The purified 2,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione (170 g., 0.66 mole) (Note 5) and 170 ml. of water are placed in a glass liner (vented) of a steel pressure vessel of 1.5-l. capacity (fitted with a pressure-release valve). The vessel is sealed, heated as rapidly as possible to 185\u2013195\u00b0, and kept at this temperature for 10\u201315 minutes (Note 6). The reaction vessel is immediately removed from the heater, placed in a large tub of ice water, and cooled to room temperature. The gas pressure then is carefully released. The resulting yellow to orange liquid is transferred to a distillation flask with the aid of a minimum volume of ethanol, and most of the water and ethanol is removed under reduced pressure by means of a rotary evaporator. The flask is attached to a short heated column fitted with a short air condenser. The remainder of the water and ethanol is removed under reduced pressure, and the 1,4-cyclohexanedione is distilled, b.p. 130\u2013133\u00b0 (20 mm.). The product solidifies to a white to pale-yellow solid, m.p. 77\u201379\u00b0, yield 60\u201366 g. (81\u201389% yield from 2,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione). The compound may be conveniently recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride (7 ml. per gram of dione); the purified product is obtained as white plates, m.p. 77\u201379\u00b0 (90% recovery)."

To this solution is added 58 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84), and the salts which precipitate are dissolved by addition of a minimum quantity of distilled water; the total volume of the solution usually does not exceed 225 ml.\nA solution of 64 g. (0.5 mole) of cyclo\u00f6ctanol (Note 1) in 1.25 l. of acetone (Note 1) is added to a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a long-stem dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a powerful mechanical stirrer (Note 2). The vigorously agitated solution is cooled in a water bath to about 20\u00b0. The chromic acid oxidizing reagent is added from the dropping funnel as a slow stream, and the rate of addition is adjusted so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 35\u00b0 (Note 3). The addition is continued until the characteristic orange color of the reagent persists for about 20 minutes (Note 4) and (Note 5). The volume of reagent added is about 120 ml.\nThe stirrer is removed, the mixture is decanted into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and the residual green salts are rinsed with two 70-ml. portions of acetone. The rinsings are added to the main acetone solution and additional oxidizing agent is added, if necessary, to ensure complete reaction. The stirrer is replaced and isopropyl alcohol is added dropwise until the excess chromic acid is destroyed (Note 6). In small portions and with caution there is added 63 g. of sodium bicarbonate, and the suspension is stirred vigorously until the pH of the reaction mixture tests neutral (Note 7). The suspension is filtered and the filter cake is washed with 25 ml. of acetone. The filtrate is concentrated by distillation through a 75-cm. length of Vigreux column until the pot temperature rises to 80\u00b0 and a water film begins to develop in the lower portions of the distillation column (Note 8). The cooled pot residue (about 110 ml.) is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, 500 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution is added, and the mixture is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with a total of 25 ml. water in several portions, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the ether distilled at atmospheric pressure. The pot residue is distilled under reduced pressure, b.p. 76\u201377\u00b0 (10 mm.) (Note 9). The yield of cyclo\u00f6ctanone is 58\u201360 g. (92\u201396%), m.p. 40\u201342\u00b0.\nAn additional 2.2 g. (4%) of cyclo\u00f6ctanone may be obtained by addition of 250 ml. of water to the green salts formed during the reaction (Note 10), extraction of the mixture with ether, distillation of the ether, and addition of 12 ml. of acetone. To the acetone solution there is added sufficient chromic acid oxidizing reagent to permit the orange color of the reagent to persist (Note 11), and the mixture is processed as above."

Attached to the top is a 100-ml. dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing side arm2 that has an inlet for nitrogen (Note 3). A thermocouple well inside the tube holds a movable thermocouple and extends to the bottom of the heated section (Note 4). The bottom of the reactor is fitted to a 500-ml. side-arm flask packed in ice. The side arm leads to two traps in series cooled in ice and to a final trap cooled in a bath of dry ice and acetone (Note 5).\nThe hottest part of the tube, which is near the middle of the heated section, is maintained at 550\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0 while dry oxygen-free nitrogen is passed successively through a flowmeter and the tube at about 150 ml. per hr. for at least 30 minutes (Note 6).

Ketene can be kept for as long as 2 weeks in this way, although some transformation to high-boiling material occurs (Note 11). However, pure ketene can be readily obtained from a partially decomposed mixture by simple distillation from the trap (Note 11) and (Note 12). Caution!

(1.5 moles) of cyclohexanone in 400 ml. of 15N aqueous ammonia (6.0 moles) in a 1-l. beaker is stirred mechanically and cooled to 0\u00b0 with an ice-salt mixture. Maintaining the temperature of the solution between 0\u00b0 and +10\u00b0, 124 g. (1.0 mole) of 90% hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (Note 1) is added in portions of about 1 g. The addition requires about 1 hour, and the mixture is stirred for another hour at 0\u00b0 and allowed to stand overnight at \u221215\u00b0 in a refrigerator. The precipitated crystalline cake is filtered and pressed tight with a glass stopper. The solid is washed with 50-ml. portions of ice-cold ether, toluene, and finally ether. There is obtained 110\u2013115 g. of product which is 70\u201390% pure (Note 2) and (Note 3). The product is divided into two portions, each of which is boiled briefly with a 50-ml. portion of toluene; the solutions are decanted from small salt residues and cooled to 0\u00b0 for 2 hours. The precipitates are filtered with suction and washed with 50 ml. of ice-cold petroleum ether. The combined yield of 3,3-pentamethylenediaziridine is 68\u201378 g.

A dense crystalline solid begins to form immediately, and after the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The dropping funnel is replaced by a gas-inlet tube which is connected to a cylinder of sulfur dioxide through a wash bottle containing concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide is bubbled through the stirred mixture until all the precipitate is dissolved. The mildly exothermic reaction is controlled by occasionally cooling the reactants with an ice bath. The benzene solvent is removed from the clear solution under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure from a Claisen flask with Vigreux indentations.

            "A 3-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser (surmounted by a drying tube), thermometer, and addition funnel is charged with 800 ml. of 3M methylmagnesium bromide solution (2.4 moles) (Note 1) and 600 ml. of anhydrous ether. The solution is stirred and cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 while a solution of 135 g. (83 ml., 0.80 mole) of thiophosphoryl chloride (Note 2) in 85 ml. of ether is added over a period of 3 hours. A thick white precipitate forms during the course of the addition. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is poured onto 500 g. of ice in a 4-l. beaker. Sulfuric acid (900 ml. of 10% solution) is added over a period of 20 minutes with gentle stirring. The mixture is filtered, and the white solid product is washed with 4 l. of water and recrystallized from 2 l. of ethanol. The product is dried over phosphorus pentoxide in a vacuum desiccator to give 50\u201355 g. (67\u201374%) of white crystalline tetramethylbiphosphine disulfide, m.p. 223\u2013227\u00b0 (Note 3). Evaporation of the mother liquor to a volume of 900 ml. gives an additional 3 g. of tetramethylbiphosphine disulfide, m.p. 222\u2013225\u00b0."

            "A solution of 0.54 g. (2 mmoles) of ferric chloride hexahydrate and 0.33 g. (3 mmoles) of diethylammonium chloride (Note 1) in 5 g. of methanol is added to a solution of 11.2 g. (0.1 mole) of 1-octene (Note 2) and 0.42 g. (2 mmoles) of benzoin (Note 3) in 36 g. (0.3 mole) of chloroform (Note 4). The resulting homogeneous mixture is introduced into a Carius tube of about 100-ml. capacity. Air is displaced by dropping a few pieces of dry ice into the tube (Note 5). The tube is sealed (Note 6), heated to 130\u00b0, kept at that temperature for 15 hours, cooled to room temperature (Note 7), and opened. The contents of the tube are transferred to a separatory funnel, and the tube is rinsed with about 10 ml. of chloroform. The reaction mixture is washed with 40 ml. of water. The aqueous solution is extracted with 10 ml. of chloroform, and the extract is added to the original chloroform layer. Solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure (bath temperature up to 130\u00b0). The distillation flask is allowed to cool, and distillation is continued at 25 mm. (bath temperature up to 120\u00b0) (Note 8). The flask is cooled again, and distillation is continued to dryness at 0.1 mm. (bath temperature up to 150\u00b0), giving crude 1,1,3-trichloro-n-nonane (19.4 g.) as a yellow oil, b.p. 60\u201385\u00b0 (0.1 mm.), n25D 1.4650. The purity of this product is 95% (Note 9), and the actual yield is 80%. Fractionation of this material through a 13-in. Vigreux column gives 15 g. (64%) of pure, colorless 1,1,3-trichloro-n-nonane, b.p. 61\u201362\u00b0 (0.1 mm.), n25D 1.4640 (Note 10) and (Note 11)."

            "A 500-ml. one-necked flask with a side arm to admit nitrogen is fitted with a reflux condenser protected at the top by a T-tube through which nitrogen is slowly passed during the entire reaction (Note 1). In the flask there is placed 12 g. (0.44 g. atom) of aluminum wool (Note 2), and the system is thoroughly dried by flaming (Note 3) and then cooled to room temperature. A positive pressure of nitrogen is maintained in the system by admission of the gas through the side arm while the flask is detached from the condenser, stoppered, and transferred to a nitrogen-filled dry box. To the flask there is added 80 g. (0.23 mole) of diphenylmercury (Note 4) which is spread evenly on top of the aluminum wool, followed by 340 ml. of sodium-dried xylene. The flask is stoppered, returned to the condenser, and immersed in a preheated oil bath, which is maintained at 140\u2013150\u00b0. The reaction mixture is allowed to reflux for 24 hours, the water drained from the condenser, and the top of the condenser is connected to a vacuum system through a trap cooled in dry ice. The xylene is distilled by gradually reducing the pressure to 20\u201330 mm. The flask is cooled to room temperature and nitrogen readmitted.\nThe flask is returned to the dry box, and the nearly dry solid that remains in it is transferred to an extraction thimble (123 mm. \u00d7 43 mm.) previously dried in a vacuum oven. The product is extracted in a dried Soxhlet apparatus (250 mm. \u00d7 50 mm.) with 250 ml. of dry ether (Note 5) in a carefully dried 300-ml. flask. The extraction is continued for 15\u201320 hours (Note 6), during which time white crystals of triphenylaluminum etherate form in the flask. The flask and its contents are placed in a dry box, the ether is decanted, and the crystals are washed several times by decantation with small portions of dry ether. The triphenylaluminum etherate is dried at 25\u00b0 under reduced pressure; m.p. 126\u2013130\u00b0. The ether of crystallization is removed by heating the etherate at 150\u00b0 (0.1 mm.) for about 13 hours (Note 7). Pure triphenylaluminum, m.p. 229\u2013232\u00b0, is obtained; yield 23\u201327 g. (59\u201370%)."
