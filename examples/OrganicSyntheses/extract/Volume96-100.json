            "Largely driven by the needs of the life sciences and material chemistry, the demand for ever more efficient procedures for cross coupling does not seem to cease. While palladium-based methods continue to dominate the field at large, the last decade has witnessed the development of a number of innovative new concepts that enrich the portfolio of the practitioner and even challenge organopalladium catalysis in certain ways.\nOne of these developments relates to the use of early transition metals in lieu of palladium (or other noble metals); actually, this megatrend reaches far beyond cross coupling chemistry.2 Utilitarian arguments render iron a particularly attractive candidate, because it is cheap, abundant, readily available, environmentally benign and hardly toxic for humans. Moreover, research into homogeneous organoiron catalysis holds the promise of opening entirely new fields of application by leveraging the unique chemical properties of this element in the midst of the periodic table.2,3\nScattered reports on the use of iron catalysts for \"cross coupling\" date back to the time before this expression had actually been coined. The first deliberate investigation was reported by Kochi and coworkers,4,5 who showed that simple iron salts are capable of catalyzing the coupling of Grignard reagents with alkenyl halides. Since the yields were variable and the reaction seemed to lack generality, only few applications followed up on this lead finding. It was Cahiez and coworkers who found that the robustness of this process can be largely improved by using aprotic dipolar cosolvents, preferentially N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one (NMP), which seems to stabilize the actual catalyst and/or activates transiently formed organoiron intermediates.6,7\nCanonical Cross Coupling\nOur group showed that the substrate scope reaches far beyond alkenyl halides. In 2002, we reported the first iron-catalyzed cross coupling reactions of aryl- and heteroaryl halides and -sulfonates (Figure 1).8,9,10,11,12 Shortly thereafter, alkenyl triflates (Figure 2) and acyl chlorides were found to be equally privileged coupling partners.13 The 2005 Organic Syntheses procedures describing the preparation of 4-nonylbenzoic acid, a component of liquid crystalline materials, captures this state of development of iron catalysis well in that it highlights the following notable virtues: (i) high yields with Grignard reagents bearing \u00df-hydrogen atoms, (ii) exceptionally fast reaction rates at (or below) room temperature, (iii) ready scalability, (iv) convenient ligand-free conditions, and (v) a surprisingly large tolerance vis-\u00e0-vis a number of functional groups that are susceptible to uncatalyzed attack by Grignard reagents. Equally important is the fact that electron deficient (hetero)aryl chlorides proved to be more suitable for iron- catalyzed cross coupling than the corresponding bromides or iodides. When working with electron rich (hetero)arenes, however, the corresponding triflates have to be used.8,9,11 Moreover, it is possible to engage substrates carrying more than one chloride or -sulfonate group either into exhaustive, or site-selective or consecutive one-pot coupling reactions.9,10,11,12,13\nFigure 1. Iron-catalyzed alkyl/(hetero)aryl cross coupling reactions;9 (throughout this article, the segment derived from the Grignard reagent is shown in red)\nFigure 2. Iron-catalyzed cross coupling of alkenyl sulfonates with MeMgX 13,27,28,29,30,31\nIn view of these favorable attributes, it may not come as a surprise that this chemistry was rapidly embraced by the academic and industrial community.14,15,16,17,18 The selected larger scale applications shown in Figure 3 are instructive and illustrate the current state of the art.19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26\nFigure 3. Applications on larger scale19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26\nOur initial reports had already shown that aryl triflates and even (electron-deficient) aryl tosylates can be cross coupled with alkyl-Grignard reagents in good to excellent yields using Fe(acac)3 as a simple yet efficient precatalyst (cf. Figure 1).8,9 Alkenyl sulfonates followed shortly thereafter (Figure 2);13,27,28 a recent Org. Synth. procedure further illustrates their utility.29 Building on these lead discoveries, the scope of the reaction was explored30,31,32,33 and other viable leaving groups were identified, including phosphonates,23,32,34,35,36,37 sulfamates,32,38,39 carbamates,38,62 carboxylates,40,64 trialkyl ammonium salts,65 and even various (thio) ethers.61,63 A few selected examples are compiled in Table 1.\nAlthough the cost of the iron salt is hardly a limiting factor, attempts were made to lower the loading; applications using \u2264 1 mol% are not uncommon.20,41,42 Non-hygroscopic and hence practical Fe(acac)3 is the most popular precatalyst; in certain cases, other salts such as FeCln (n = 2, 3), FeF3-3H2O,38,49 or iron thiolates43 show better performance. Likewise, numerous iron complexes (formed ex situ or in situ) show good application profiles.\nNMP remains the preferred co-solvent for iron-catalyzed cross coupling reactions (although certain reactions work better in its absence). This compound, however, is potentially repro-toxic. Therefore many attempts were made to avoid its use altogether or substitute NMP by more benign additives, solvents or ligands.6,29,44,45,54 Among them, cyclic ureas such as N,N-dimethylimidazolidin-2-one (DMI)55 and various (di)amines, especially TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine),29,46,47,48 are most common; their use, however, often mandates slow addition of the Grignard reagent to the reaction mixture. Moreover, numerous reports rely on the use of NHC's or (chelating) (di)phosphines.49,50,51,52,53\nTable 1. Iron-catalyzed cross coupling: Representative examples\nThese advances notwithstanding, some important limitations also need to be mentioned. In contrast to palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, which excel when it comes to the formation of C(sp2)-C(sp2) or C(sp2)-C(sp) bonds, most notably aryl-aryl bonds, iron catalysis is currently much less adequate for this very purpose; competing homo-coupling of the Grignard reagent limits the scope. Although advances have been reported, a general solution that truly rivals palladium (or nickel) catalysts in this particularly important field of applications currently remains elusive.9,38,39,49,66,67,68,75\nThe fact that Grignard reagents are privileged nucleophiles denotes an advantage and a serious limitation at the same time. They are cheap and industrially viable but obviously limited with regard to functional group compatibility. Yet, the exceptional rate of many iron-catalyzed cross coupling reactions partly mitigates this shortcoming: thus, a number of substrates has been successfully engaged, which carry electrophilic substituents that might not subsist in the presence of organomagnesium reagents otherwise. Without claim to be complete, the list includes: alkyl- and aryl halides, amides, carbamates, enoates, epoxides, esters, isocyanates, ketones, nitriles, sulfonates, sulfonamides, thio-carbamates; such kinetic selectivity, however, is potentially case-dependent. Therefore the need persists to enlarge the portfolio of adequate nucleophiles. Encouraging results have been obtained with organomanganese,69,70 -zinc,59,71,72,73 -lithium,74 -copper, 75 and -boron reagents.76,77,78,79,80\nIn this context, it is pointed out that alkyl/aryl cross coupling can also be effected without preparing a Grignard reagent in a separate step.81,82 As an example, treatment of a mixture of cyclopentyl bromide and 1-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene with magnesium and catalytic amounts of FeCl2 in THF/TMEDA at ambient temperature afforded 1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene in 67% yield on up to 60 kg scale (Figure 3).83 As the Grignard reagent transiently formed is directly consumed, large concentrations will not be build-up at any point in time.\nNon-Canonical Cross Coupling\nThe promise that cheap and benign iron catalysts allow palladium to be substituted - at least in certain cross coupling reactions - was (and is) a major incentive.6,8,9 It soon became clear, however, that this metal is also able to promote cross coupling reactions of substrates that have little or no precedent in the classical canon.\nThe readiness with which primary and secondary alkyl halides participate in iron-catalyzed cross coupling with arylmagnesium halides and other nucleophiles illustrates the point.47,48,50,51,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91 The functional group tolerance is remarkable and even sterically hindered alkyl halides usually react well (Table 2). Moreover, exploratory studies showed that asymmetric enantioconvergent cross coupling of racemic secondary alkyl halides is possible with iron catalysts bearing chelating diphosphine ligands that are chiral at phosphorus (Scheme 1).92\nScheme 1. Pioneering study into asymmetric iron-catalyzed aryl/alkyl cross coupling92\nEven less conventional substrates work well (Table 2). 1-Alkynylcyclopropyl tosylates, for example, react with Grignard reagents in the presence of Fe(acac)3 cat. under net propargylic substitution;112 this striking result illustrates that even tertiary alkyl electrophiles can be successfully engaged in iron-catalyzed cross coupling.52,112 Yet, this pattern contrasts the behavior of most other propargylic compounds, which usually afford allenes by SN2' type substitution reactions (except for some propargyl bromides).93,94,95,96,97,113 For propargylic epoxides it was shown that the RMgX reagent approaches syn to the O-atom, whereas organocopper reagents deliver the R-substituent anti to the leaving group.95,113\nAn unconventional cross coupling reaction is manifest in the conversion of lactone-derived gem-dichloroalkenes into non-terminal alkynes (Scheme 2).98,99,100 Note that the R-group of the organolithium reagent is incorporated into the product as the substituent capping the alkyne; this transformation likely proceeds via carbenoid intermediates. Even more involved cross coupling \"cascades\" are known in the literature (Scheme 2).101,102\nTable 2. Iron-catalyzed cross coupling of unorthodox electrophiles\nScheme 2. Some unorthodox iron-catalyzed \"cross coupling\" reactions99,101,102,118\nThe iron-catalyzed ring opening/cross coupling of 2-pyrone derivatives is fairly unique.116 In a formal sense, the enol ester moiety embedded into the heterocyclic ring serves as a leaving group. The available mechanistic evidence, however, suggests that the iron catalyst formed in situ does not insert into the C-O bond; rather, coordination to the pyrone \u03c0-system is thought to trigger a 1,6-addition/ring opening cascade. Whether the ring opening step itself is an electrocyclic process or follows an ionic mechanism remains to be firmly established. In any case, this chemistry is compatible with functional groups and various donor sites; it gives access to non-thermodynamic dienoates that are difficult to make in isomerically pure form otherwise. A late-stage application during the total synthesis of the potent anticancer agent pateamine A illustrates this aspect (Scheme 2).117,118\nThis Discussion Addendum cannot provide a comprehensive treatise of iron-catalyzed cross coupling, broadly defined;14,15,16,17,18 rather, the chosen examples are meant to illustrate the tremendous advances in the field since the original Org. Synth. procedure was published in 2005. Although further growth can be safely anticipated, iron catalysis at large awaits better mechanistic understanding.2 The massive analytical challenges notwithstanding, substantial recent progress provides an encouraging outlook.119,120"

In a 500-mL one-necked round-bottomed flask (24/40), glyoxal (60 mL, 73 g, 0.50 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) is dissolved in MeOH (250 mL). The resulting solution in the 500-mL flask is then added via a glass funnel to the 2000-mL flask over 2 min. The 2000-mL reaction flask is equipped with a reflux condensor, which is sealed with a rubber septum (Note 4) (Figure 1A) and placed into an oil bath (preheated at 50 \u00b0C). The reaction mixture is stirred (Note 5) at 50 \u00b0C (Note 6) for 15 min (Note 7), after which the oil bath is removed to allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature (Note 8) over 30 min. Subsequently, the reaction mixture is stirred (Note 5) at room temperature (Note 8) for an additional 10 h (Figure 1B), the resultant yellow solid is collected by filtration (Note 9) and rinsed with MeOH (3 \u00d7 200 mL) in a glass fritted funnel (Note 10) (Figure 1C). The resulting yellow solid is transferred to a 1000-mL one-necked round-bottomed flask (24/40) and volatiles are removed on a rotary evaporator (35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C, 20 min) (Note 11) followed by further drying under vacuum (Note 12) at room temperature (Note 8) for 16 h to afford 167 g (89%) of N,N\u2032-1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,4-diazabutadiene as a yellow solid (Note 13).\nFigure 1.

Both reaction flasks are equipped with 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnels (Figure 2A), which are charged with a solution of TMSCl (2 \u00d7 15 mL, 2 \u00d7 13 g, 0.23 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 15) in EtOAc (2 \u00d7 15 mL) and sealed with a rubber septum (Note 4). The reaction flasks are placed in an oil bath, which is preheated at 70 \u00b0C (Note 6). After the reaction mixtures are stirred at 70 \u00b0C (Note 6) for 10 min, the TMSCl solutions are added dropwise over 45 min with the external temperature maintained between 65 \u00b0C and 75 \u00b0C (Note 6) (Figure 2B). The resulting mixtures are stirred (Note 5) at 70 \u00b0C (Note 6) for an additional 2 h (Figure 2C). The flasks are then removed from the oil bath and cooled in an ice-water bath (Note 16) for ca. 20 min to allow the internal temperature of the reaction mixture to reach 15 \u00b0C (Note 17).\nFigure 2.

After evaporation of the volatiles on a rotary evaporator (35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C, 20 min) (Note 11), the solid is further dried by heating in an oil bath (preheated at 150 \u00b0C) at 150 \u00b0C (Note 6) under vacuum (Note 12) (Figure 3B) for 10 h to afford 73 g of compound 2 as a pinkish solid (75%) (Note 18) (Figure 3C).\nFigure 3.

In air, a 1000-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40), equipped with a Teflon-coated egg-shaped magnetic stirbar (3/4\u2033 \u00d7 2\u2033), is charged with N,N\u2032-1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium chloride (2) (52 g, 0.12 mol, 1.0 equiv) and t-BuOK (18 g, 0.15 mol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 19). The flask is evacuated (Note 12) at room temperature (Note 8) for 12 h, then backfilled with nitrogen (Note 20), subsequently sealed with a rubber septum and connected to a Schlenk line via a needle adapter (Figure 4A). The flask is evacuated (Note 12) for 3 min and then backfilled with nitrogen. The procedure is repeated three times, and the flask is filled with nitrogen and kept under a positive pressure of nitrogen via a gas inlet (Note 20) through the needle adapter. Anhydrous THF (240 mL) (Note 21) is then added via syringe (Note 22), and the resulting orange heterogeneous mixture (Note 23) is stirred (Note 5) under an atmosphere of nitrogen (Note 20) at room temperature (Note 8) for 10 h (Figure 4B and C). The reaction mixture is exposed to air and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) (Note 11) to afford a yellow solid. Toluene (450 mL) (Note 24) is added to the flask, and the flask is then placed into an oil bath that is preheated to 55 \u00b0C (Note 6). After the orange heterogeneous mixture is stirred at 55 \u00b0C (Note 6) for 10 min (Figure 5A), the flask is removed from the oil bath, and the hot orange mixture in the flask is poured in 5 portions into a 350 mL funnel that is preloaded with a pad of Celite (Notes 9 and 25). Suction is applied to dry the filter cake.\nFigure 4.

Elution with toluene (100 mL) is repeated twice. The filtrate is collected, transferred to a 1000-mL one-necked round-bottomed flask (24/40), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (15 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) (Note 11) to afford a beige solid (Note 26) (Figure 5C), which is immediately dissolved in THF (240 mL) (Note 27) to afford an orange solution, and the solution is transferred into a two-necked, 1000-mL round-bottomed flask.\nFigure 5. Appearance of the A) toluene solution while heating, B) filtration set-up, and C) carbene intermediate\nWhile exposed to air, the 1000-mL flask is equipped with a glass thermometer and a Teflon-coated egg-shaped magnetic stirbar (3/4\u2033 \u00d7 2\u2033) is added. The orange solution is stirred (Note 5) and cooled in a dry ice-MeOH/H2O bath to between -55 \u00b0C and -45 \u00b0C (bath temperature) (Note 28) for 10 min (Figure 6A). 1,1,1,2,2,2-Hexachloroethane (29 g, 0.12 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 29) is then added to the reaction flask in 5 roughly equal portions over 5 min with the internal temperature maintained between -45 \u00b0C and -40 \u00b0C.\nFigure 6. A) Reaction set-up, B) appearance after addition of Cl3CCCl3, and C) appearance after 20 h\nAfter addition, the reaction flask is sealed with a rubber septum (Note 4), and the reaction mixture is stirred (Note 5) between -55 \u00b0C and -45 \u00b0C (bath temperature) (Note 28) for an additional 30 min (Note 30) (Figure 6B). The dry ice-MeOH/H2O bath is then removed. The reaction mixture is stirred (Note 5) and allowed to warm to room temperature (Note 8) over the course of 45 min and then stirred (Note 5) at room temperature (Note 8) for an additional 20 h (Figure 6C). The resulting heterogeneous mixture is filtered through a fritted funnel (Note 9), and the resulting filter cake is rinsed with THF (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 31) and then with toluene (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 31) (Figure 7A). The resultant colorless solid is ground into a fine powder in a porcelain mortar (Figure 7B). The resulting powder is transferred into a 500-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40), heated to 180 \u00b0C (Note 32) under vacuum (Note 12) for 24 h using a heating mantle connected to a variac, (Figure 8A) to afford 45 g of the title compound (3) as a colorless powder (80%) (Note 33) (Figure 8B).\nFigure 7.

In air, a 500-mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask (24/40), with a side arm fitted with a T-bore glass stopcock, is equipped with a Teflon-coated egg-shaped magnetic stirbar (3/4\u2033 \u00d7 2\u2033). N,N-1,3-Bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-chloroimidazolium chloride (3) (14 g, 31 mmol, 1.5 equiv) and CsF (25 g, 0.17 mol, 8.0 equiv) (Note 34) are added to the Schlenk flask. The flask is subsequently shaken manually for 30 sec to afford PhenoFluorMix as a colorless powder. The flask is then equipped with a glass stopper (24/40), connected to a Schlenk line via the side arm, evacuated (Note 12) and heated in an oil bath (preheated at 140 \u00b0C) at 140 \u00b0C (Note 6) for 1 h. The oil bath is then removed to allow the flask to cool to room temperature (Note 8) over the course of 45 min. The flask is backfilled with nitrogen and left under an atmosphere of nitrogen via a nitrogen inlet (Note 20) through the side arm. The glass stopper is removed, and estradiol-enanthate (8.00 g, 20.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 35) is added in one portion within 1 min. The flask is subsequently equipped with a Dimroth condenser, which is connected to the Schlenk line via a glass adaptor (hose connection, vacuum/gas) (Note 36). The side arm is subsequently closed, and the entire reaction apparatus is evacuated (Note 12) for 3 min via the glass adaptor and then backfilled with nitrogen. After the evacuation-backfilling procedure is repeated three times, the reaction apparatus remains under a positive pressure of nitrogen (Note 20) via a nitrogen inlet through the glass adaptor (Figure 9A). Anhydrous toluene (300 mL) (Note 21) is subsequently added through the side arm via syringe (Notes 22 and 37). The resulting colorless heterogeneous mixture is stirred at 600 rpm (Note 5) at room temperature (Note 8) for 30 min (Figure 9B), and the reaction flask is subsequently transferred into an oil bath, which is preheated to 120 \u00b0C (Note 6).\nFigure 9.

Upon exposure to air, the Dimroth condenser is removed, and the resulting brown heterogeneous mixture in the flask is filtered using a glass-fritted funnel with 150-mL capacity (Note 9) to give a colorless filter cake and a brown filtrate. The reaction flask is rinsed with dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 38), and the resulting mixture is poured onto the filter cake, and suction is applied to dry the filter cake. The dichloromethane rinse procedure is repeated three times. The collected filtrate is transferred into a 1000-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 mmHg, 42 \u00b0C) (Note 11) to afford a brown solid. Hexanes (100 mL) (Note 39) is added to the flask, which is subsequently shaken manually for 2 min. The resulting heterogeneous mixture is filtered through a glass-fritted funnel with 150-mL capacity (Note 9) to give a brown filter cake and a light brown filtrate. The flask is rinsed with hexanes (20 mL), and subsequently the resulting mixture is poured onto the filter cake, and suction is applied to dry the filter cake (Figure 10A). The hexanes rinse procedure is repeated three times. The filtrate is then transferred into a 250-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) (Note 11) to afford a brown oil, which is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (Note 40).\nFigure 10.

Reaction set-up for the formation of the boronic ester 1\nThe mixture is refluxed with stirring for 2 h under an argon atmosphere (Note 5). The resulting colorless solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is then transferred to a 1 L-separatory funnel and washed with tap water (80 mL x 3) and brine (70 mL x 1). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (15 g) (Note 6) and filtered with pleated filter paper (#2 filter paper) to give a colorless solution, which is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (50 \u00b0C, 780 to 60 mmHg) and the resulting residue is then dried in vacuo (0.80 mmHg) for 1 h. The resulting colorless solid is dissolved in 230 mL of Et2O-hexane (Notes 7 and 8) (4:1, Et2O:hexane) by warming the solution on a water bath (50 \u00b0C). The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (50 \u00b0C, 780 to 400 mmHg) to provide a colorless precipitate. The precipitate is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (11 cm diameter) with #1 filter paper and washed with cold hexane (10 \u00b0C) (Note 7), giving the title compound 1 as colorless plates (12.5 g, 50.4 mmol, 91%) (Figure 2) (Notes 9 and 10).\nFigure 2.

The side neck of Flask B is sealed with a rubber septum. The reflux condenser and the connecting adapter are connected to an argon/vacuum line and the bottom is capped with Flask A.

            "The conjugate addition of enantiopure lithium N-benzyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amide to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters and amides displays high diastereoselectivity with extremely wide substrate scope and thus this process has been recognized as one of the most robust and reliable methods to prepare \u03b2-amino acid derivatives. The stereochemical outcome of this process is predictable in most cases and is rationalised by a transition state mnemonic.2 This methodology has found numerous applications, including in the areas of target synthesis and molecular recognition phenomen\u03b1, and was comprehensively reviewed in 2005,3 2012,4 and 2017.5\nLithium Amide Family and Selective Deprotection Strategies\nIn addition to the most commonly employed lithium amide reagent, lithium N-benzyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amide, more than 20 analogues which incorporate allyl, various substituted benzyl, haloalkyl, and methylheteroaryl groups have been developed for conjugate addition. Enantiomerically pure lithium amides 18 and 21 as a chiral \"hydroxylamine equivalent\" and a chiral \"aniline equivalent\", respectively, have also been developed. Conjugate additions of some representative members of the lithium amide family are presented below and the conjugate addition products 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 and 22 were isolated as single diastereoisomers (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1. Conjugate additions of representative lithium amides [PMP = 4-methoxyphenyl; TDBMS = tert-butyldimethylsilyl]6,7,8,9,10,11\nSeveral chemoselective deprotection methods for removal of the N-protecting groups have been developed. For example, treatment of 23 with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in MeCN/H2O at rt for 2 h12 gave selectively mono-debenzylated \u03b2-amino ester 24 in 60% yield.13 Oxidative removal of the N-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl group within 25 with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) gave 26 in 98% yield.14 The p-methoxy variant, incorporating an N -\u03b1-methyl-p-methoxybenyl group, can be removed under various acidic conditions; for example: treatment of 10 with HCO2H and Et3SiH gave 27 in 81% yield.7 Treatment of 28 with a Pd catalyst and N,N-dimethylbarbituric acid 29 smoothly removed the N-allyl group to give 30 in 97% yield (Scheme 2).15\nScheme 2. Representative chemoselective N-deprotections [PMP = 4-methoxyphenyl; TDBMS = tert-butyldimethylsilyl]\n\u03b1-Functionalisation of \u03b2-Amino Acid Derivatives\nIn order to expand the structural diversity of the accessible \u03b2-amino acid derivatives, \u03b1-functionalisation of the \u03b2-amino ester has been investigated. \u03b1-Functionalisation of the \u03b2-amino acid derivatives can be achieved via elaboration of the intermediate enolate resulting from conjugate addition of a lithium amide reagent to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester with an electrophile (tandem manner). Alternatively, \u03b1-functionalisation can be achieved upon formation of the corresponding \u03b2-amino enolate upon deprotonation of a \u03b2-amino ester with a strong base (e.g., LDA, NaHMDS etc) followed by treatment with an electrophile (stepwise manner). The stereochemical outcome and diastereoselectivity of these processes depends on the nature of the substrate and the electrophile.16 For example, \"tandem\" conjugate addition/alkylation upon reaction of (S)-32 and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester 31 followed by the addition of allyl bromide to the intermediate lithium (Z)-\u03b2-amino enolate (Z)-33 gave 34 in 60% yield as an 85:15 mixture of C(2)-epimers,17 while treatment of \u03b2-amino ester 35 with LiTMP to form the corresponding enolate (E)-36 in situ and addition of acrolein 37 gave 38 in 96% yield as a single diastereoisomeric product (Scheme 3).18\nScheme 3. \"Tandem\" and \"stepwise\" \u03b1-functionalisation strategies\nTreatment of \u03b2-amino enolates, derived from the conjugate addition of an enantiopure lithium amide 40 to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester 39, with various electrophiles facilitated the preparation of a range of \u03b1-fluoro,\n\u03b1-mercapto, and \u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino acid derivatives 41. For example, Duggan and co-workers reported the tandem conjugate addition/fluorination of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester using the electrophilic fluorinating agent N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI), which gave anti-\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-amino ester 42 in 77% yield.19 Similarly, anti-\u03b1-tert-butylthio-\u03b2-amino ester 43 was obtained in 88% yield as a single diastereoisomer by in situ enolate trapping with TsStBu.20 In situ enolate oxidation with the requisite antipode of canmphorsulfonyloxaziridine (CSO) has been well-established as a powerful tool for asymmetric anti-aminohydroxylation and has been frequently reported in the literature (>50 examples in the last 5 years). For example, 44 was obtained by conjugate addition of (R)-32 to the requisite \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester followed by enolate oxidation with (-)-CSO in 80% yield as a single diastereoisomer (Scheme 4).21,22\nScheme 4. \u03b1-Functionalisation of \u03b2-amino enolates\nThe corresponding syn-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino ester 47 can be prepared via an oxidation/diastereoselective reduction protocol.23 For example, Swern oxidation of anti-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino ester 45 gives the corresponding ketone 46, and reduction with either NaBH4 in MeOH or DIBAL-H in THF gives typically a >90:10 mixture of syn-47 and anti-45, respectively, and the corresponding syn-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino ester 47 can be isolated as a single diastereoisomer. Representative recent examples are shown below (Scheme 5).22,24,25\nScheme 5. Preparation of syn-\u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy esters\nCyclic \u03b2-Amino Acid Syntheses\nPreparations of enantiopure cyclic \u03b2-amino acids were also developed via conjugate addition of lithium N-allyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amide or lithium N-but-3-enyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amide to a suitable \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester followed by ring-closing metathesis as the key steps. For example, conjugate addition of lithium (S)-N-allyl-N-(\u03b1-methylbenzyl)amide (S)-6 to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester 51 (derived from sorbic acid) gave \u03b2-amino ester 52 in 78% yield. Ring-closing metathesis of 52 with Grubbs I catalyst gave the cyclic \u03b2-amino ester 53 in 77% yield. Stepwise hydrogenation of 53 in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst and subsequent hydrogenolytic removal of the N-protecting group gave amino ester 55 in 79% yield (from 53). Acid-mediated ester hydrolysis gave (S)-homoproline 56 in 96% yield (Scheme 6).26 Application of this methodology, involving the conjugate addition of an enantiopure lithium amide incorporating alkenyl functionality to the requisite \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters followed by ring-closing metathesis, provided key intermediates for a wide range of azacyclic scaffolds such as cyclic \u03b2-amino acids 57-59, pyrrolidines,27 piperidines,28,29,30 and pyrrolizidines.17,31,32\nScheme 6. Preparation of cyclic \u03b2-amino acids\nRearrangement towards \u03b1-Amino Acids\nSynthetic routes to access natural and non-natural \u03b1-amino acid derivatives have also been developed via the aminohydroxylation of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester and stereospecific rearrangement via the corresponding aziridinium ion intermediate.24,25 For example, aminohydroxylation of 1 with (R)-32 and (-)-CSO gave anti-\u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino ester 60 in 56% yield and >99:1 dr. Treatment of 60 with Tf2O and DTBMP 61 activates the hydroxy group within 60 as a triflate followed by formation of the corresponding aziridinium ion intermediate 62 upon displacement by the adjacent tertiary amino group. Subsequent regioselective ring-opening of 62 with H2O gave \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b1-amino ester 63 in 68% yield and >99:1 dr after purification. Deprotection of 63 via hydrogenolysis in the presence of a Pd catalyst followed by acid-mediated hydrolysis gave (S,S)-\u03b2-hydroxyleucine 64 in 69% yield and \u226596:4 dr over 2 steps (Scheme 7).33 This rearrangement progresses via an aziridinium ion intermediate using other nucleophiles (such as fluoride and azide) allowed access to various \u03b2-functionalized \u03b1-amino acid derivatives in high diastereoisomeric purity.34\nScheme 7. \u03b1-Amino acid synthesis via aziridinium rearrangement\nIn conclusion, the conjugate addition of enantiopure lithium amides to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has consistently been demonstrated in high chemical yield and excellent diastereoselectivity with a wide range of substrate scope. Significant development for the elaboration of the resultant \u03b2-amino ester products or \u03b2-amino enolates has been achieved in the past few years and this will continuously contribute not only to the area of amino acid/peptide chemistry but also in the areas of natural products and pharmaceutically important target syntheses."

            "For the past 50 years, benzynes and related arynes have been a major subject of study among physical organic chemists due to their unusual electronic and structural properties. However, the utility of these strained intermediates in the domain of chemical synthesis has only relatively recently undergone a vibrant expansion. The direct insertion of aryne and heteroaryne moieties into carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom \u03c3 bonds presents an intriguing and unique strategy for the rapid functionalization of aryl and heteroaryl systems. Following our 2009 Organic Syntheses article on the acyl-alkylation of arynes with \u03b2-ketoesters,2 there have been numerous reports of related transformations involving these highly reactive intermediates. This discussion addendum is intended to document advances made in the field of (hetero)arynes since our initial disclosure. Topics covered will be divided as follows: recent methods for the acyl-functionalization of arynes, syntheses of related strained systems, applications in heterocycle synthesis, miscellaneous transformations, and strategic uses in natural product synthesis. A supplemental review on aryne insertions into \u03c3 bonds is available.3 Applications of arynes in transition metal catalysis will not be discussed in detail, however there are thorough reviews on the subject.4,5\nAcyl-functionalization of Arynes\nYoshida reported an analogous acyl-alkylation method to ours, but using trifluoromethyl ketones (2, Scheme 1).6 The trifluoromethyl group is required because it enhances the acidity of the \u03b1-keto C-H bonds. The authors note that the presence of bulky R groups on the aryl system of 2 results in competitive O-addition of the enolate intermediate.\nScheme 1. Aryne insertion into benzyl trifluoromethyl ketones\nOur lab has discovered a related insertion of arynes into various symmetrical imides 3 to afford acyl-aminated arenes 4 (Scheme 2).7 The difunctionalized products can be derivatized to quinolones and indoles. Christmann and coworkers later applied the principles of flow chemistry to this acyl-amination protocol with unsymmetrical imides, achieving the total synthesis of several natural products.8\nScheme 2. Aryne insertion into imides\nThe Biju group disclosed an amino-carboxylation of arynes using aniline derivatives (Scheme 3).9 This method offers a divergent approach for the synthesis of differentially substituted acyl-aminated arenes depending on the electronics of the aniline ring.\nScheme 3. Tunable acyl-amination of arynes with anilines\nArynes in Heterocycle Synthesis\nPerhaps the greatest recent synthetic advances in aryne chemistry are dedicated to the one-step construction of heterocycles (Figure 1). Larock provides an excellent review on the subject.10 The Larock group has also disclosed numerous aryne annulation approaches for the synthesis of dihydrobenzisoxazoles (5),11 indazoles (6),12,13 and pyrido[1,2-a]indoles (7 and 8).14 Shioji and coworkers disclosed the preparation of xanthones (9), xanthenes, and xanthols using arynes.15 Our lab has reported the divergent synthesis of iminoindenones and iminoisobenzofurans (10) via a three-component procedure.16 We have also disclosed the one-pot preparation of 3-hydroxyisoquinolines (11) through an acyl-alkylation/condensation approach.17 Additionally, we reported the formation of N-phenyl acridone (12) by means of a C-N insertion of \u03b2-lactam.18 The Studer lab disclosed the rapid synthesis of N-substituted carbazoles (13) by reacting arynes with nitrosoarenes.19 Greaney and coworkers prepared phenoxathiin-dioxides (14) via a thia-Fries/cyclization process.20 The Kobayashi group reported the formation of isocoumarins (15) via a Pd-catalyzed three-component reaction between arynes, alkynes, and carbon dioxide.21 Isocoumarins can also be prepared under transition-metal-free conditions.22 Biju presented methods for the synthesis of oxaphosphacycles (16),23 phthalimides (17),24 and indoles (18).25 The Greaney lab has also synthesized indoles from arynes by means of a Fischer indole-type reaction.26 The Miyabe group reported the synthesis of benzofurans (19).27 They have also discovered the cycloaddition between arynes and DMF to afford 4-aminobenzopyrans such as20.28 The Li group prepared benzothiazoles (21) by means of a relay aryne sequence.29 Lastly, Su and coworkers prepared 2-arylated benzoxazoles (22) by means of a domino aryne reaction.30\nFigure 1. Various heterocycles recently assembled by aryne annulation methods\nMethods for the Synthesis Heteroarynes and Other Strained Intermediates\nIn 2010, our lab reported the formation of highly substituted aryne precursors and their potential synthetic applications in the construction of complex molecules (Figure 2).31 The marked carbons denote the preferred site of selective nucleophilic attack following aryne formation.\nFigure 2. Synthesizable highly substituted aryne precursors\nThe laboratory of Garg has investigated various insertion strategies with heteroarynes and other strained ring systems. Because many of these reactions result in unsymmetrical products, they have computationally derived a model for predicting the regioselectivity during the insertion step based on angle distortion.32,33 This model has been exploited for the regioselective insertion of indolynes,34 pyridynes,35,36 piperidynes,37 as well as various oxacyclic alkynes (Figure 3).38 Contemporaneously, the Danheiser lab reported the first preparation and diverse applications of N-tosylpiperidynes.39 It is worthwhile to note that the preferred site of nucleophilic attack may be either enhanced or overturned depending on the substitution pattern on the heteroaryl ring. The chemistry of pyrimidynes has also been investigated, but there have been no reports of their successful formation.40\nFigure 3. Strained heterocycles studied recently by the Garg and Danheiser labs\nSimilar insertion strategies have been achieved with strained non-aromatic carbocycles such as cyclopentyne (23, Figure 4),41 cyclohexyne (24), and cyclic allene 25.42\nFigure 4. Strained non-aromatic ring systems\nThe Hoye group has vigorously studied the generation of arynes via an unusual hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction (HDDA, Figure 5).43,44 Areas of study in the field are numerous, including Lewis-acid-promoted C-H insertion,45 domino reactions,46,47 photochemistry,48,49 mechanistic studies,50,51 multicomponent reactions,52 and natural product diversification.53 The regioselectivity for the ensuing insertion process is influenced by both the choice of nucleophile and the substituents on the aryne system.54 The Lee group has demonstrated that these HDDA adducts can also participate in ene reactions.55\nFigure 5. A hexadehydro-Diels-Alder affords an aryne\nThe advent of silylaryl-1,3-ditriflates such as 26 has given rise to aryne relay chemistry (Scheme 4). Li and coworkers demonstrated the utility of these substrates as a means to generate trifunctionalized systems with thioamides, furnishing benzothiazoles (27).29 A plausible mechanism for this process is shown below. They have also achieved similar relay chemistry with sulfoxides56 and sulfonamides.57,58,59 In 2016, Yoshida reported an advancement of this concept.60 The Li group discovered that these latent 1,2-benzdiynes can also participate in ene reactions.61\nScheme 4. One-pot elaboration of 1,2-benzdiyne precursor 26 to benzothiazole 27\nMiscellaneous Transformations\nMany recent methods involving arynes are not readily classifiable in the above sections. This section provides a brief survey of such transformations. The Greaney group has discovered a means of difunctionalizing arynes with thioureas to afford thioaryl amidines.62 They also pioneered other heterofunctionalization strategies via three-component coupling63 and Truce-Smiles rearrangement.64 The Biju group has found many novel applications of arynes, including their ability to induce 2,3-Stevens rearrangements in allylthioethers.65,66 They have also identified arynes as latent aryl anion equivalents.67 The Studer lab has reported the formation of ortho-sulfinylaryl vinyl ethers,68 biphenyls,69 trialkylstannyl arylphosphanes,70 and sulfonium ylides71 by means of aryne insertion chemistry. The Lautens group has actively explored the applications of the intramolecular aryne-ene reactions.72,73\nDespite a resurgent interest in the study of benzyne, there remain relatively few methods for the preparation of the trimethylsilylaryl triflate precursor (1, Scheme 5).74 In 2009, the Garg lab reported a facile synthesis of precursor 1 in three steps starting from phenol (28).75 Thus, 28 was treated with isopropyl isocyanate (29) to afford carbamate 30. Following N-silylation, a directed ortho-lithiation and subsequent trapping with TMSCl provides silylarene 31 upon acidic workup. The carbamate functionality of 31 is next cleaved by aminolysis to form transient phenol derivative 32, which is converted to silylaryl triflate 1 by reaction with N-phenyl triflimide.\nScheme 5. Garg's 3-step synthesis of benzyne precursor 1\nThere has been one report harnessing arynes and cyclic alkynes for the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centers (Scheme 6).76 Chiral enamine auxiliaries bearing 9-anthryl substituents were found to confer the highest levels of stereoinduction.\nScheme 6. Asymmetric formation of quaternary centers with arynes\nArynes in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn recent years, arynes have enjoyed a privileged role in total synthesis. For more information, we recommend consulting two reviews77,78 and the references therein. In 2010, our lab performed an enantioselective synthesis of (-)-curvularin (34, Scheme 7) and (\u2212)-diplodialide C via aryne acyl-alkylation.79 The requisite macrocycle 33 was constructed by means of a ring-closing metathesis.\nScheme 7. Concise synthesis of 34 enabled by aryne acyl-alkylation\nSimilarly, Yoshida and coworkers presented an expedient approach to the synthesis of cytosporone B (35, Scheme 8), relying on an acyl-alkylation disconnection.80\nScheme 8. Retrosynthetic analysis of 35 leads to an aryne insertion\nThe Buszek group reported the total synthesis of cis-trikentin A (37, Scheme 9) using an indolyne cycloaddition.81 In this case, the indolyne intermediate is generated from dibromide 36 via lithium-halogen exchange and subsequent elimination.\nScheme 9. Facile synthesis of 37 via an indolyne cycloaddition\nLikewise, the Garg lab reported a synthesis of various N-methylwelwitindolinones such as 3882 by means of an indolyne cyclization (Scheme 10).83,84,85,86,87 Here, indolyne formation is triggered by base-induced halide elimination. The authors note minor issues of competing O-addition of the enolate in intermediate 39.\nScheme 10. Garg's retrosynthetic analysis of 38 reveals an indolyne annulation\nArgade and coworkers disclosed the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-cruciferane (40, Scheme 11) using aryne chemistry.88 Notably, the crucial aryne insertion step occurs in excellent yield.\nScheme 11. Expedient total synthesis of 40 by aryne cyclization\nThe Garg lab has incorporated carbazolyne chemistry in the total syntheses of tubingensin A89 (41, Scheme 12) and tubingensin B.90 The labeled quaternary stereocenter in 41 is formed in good yield and with exquisite diastereoselectivity due to the rigid conformational constraints on the system.\nScheme 12. Retrosynthesis of tubingensin A (41) by carbazolyne annulation\nGarg has also synthesized indolactam-containing natural products such as indolactam V (43, Scheme 13).91 The strategically placed bromide substituent in 42 is essential for overturning the inherent regioselectivity associated with the key C-N bond-forming step.\nScheme 13. Synthesis of indolactam V (43) by indolyne amination\nThe Lee group leveraged HDDA chemistry for the rapid total synthesis of selaginpulvilin D (46, Scheme 14).92 It is interesting to note that despite occurring under formally oxidizing conditions, the benzyne intermediate arising from an intramolecular HDDA of tetrayne 44 undergoes in situ transfer hydrogenation by the action of cyclooctane to afford fluorenone 45.\nScheme 14. Lee's total synthesis of 46 hinges on an elegant oxidation/intramolecular HDDA/hydrogenation sequence\nIn 2018, the Sarpong lab reported the acyl-alkylation of benzyne derivative 47 to access the seven-membered carbocyclic core of the diterpenoid alkaloid cossonidine (Scheme 15).93 Once again, a bromide substituent is necessary in order to ensure proper regioselectivity.\nScheme 15. Sarpong's acyl-alkylation approach to the central seven-membered ring of cossonidine\nZhu and coworkers disclosed a novel heteroannulation of arynes using \u03b1-amino imides.94 This method was employed for the total synthesis of (+)-hinckdentine A (48, Scheme 16).\nScheme 16. Zhu harnessed a novel acyl-amination strategy for the total synthesis of 48\nRecently, our lab reported the non-biomimetic total syntheses of (-)-jorunnamycin A (50, Scheme 17) and (-)-jorumycin in 15 and 16 steps, respectively.95 Amid this route, one of the necessary isoquinoline monomers was prepared using aryne chemistry. In this instance, the acyl-alkylation product is subjected to in situ condensation with ammonium hydroxide to afford densely functionalized isoquinoline 49.17 Remarkably, four of the five carbon-based stereocenters present in 50 are set in one step via an iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Unlike previous approaches to these bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline natural products, this route is amenable to the synthesis of a diverse array of nonnatural analogs, because the aryne chemistry is independent of classical Pictet-Spengler approaches that have been employed in the syntheses of these alkaloids.\nScheme 17. Formation of isoquinoline monomer 49 en route to (-)-jorunnamycin A (50) and (-)-jorumycin\nConcluding Remarks\nClearly the field of aryne chemistry has experienced rapid growth over the last decade. In addition to the discovery of various methods strategically related to our initial acyl-alkylation disclosure, there have been many other impressive applications in the context of methods and total synthesis. Based on these recent developments, it is evident that these curious and highly reactive intermediates will continue to inspire chemists to discover new and synthetically useful reactions for the foreseeable future."

            "The benzofuran scaffold is an important heterocyclic core component found in several natural products and in polymers.2,3 Typically, 2,3-disubstituted benzofurans are notable building blocks in many medicinal and biologically active compounds.4,5,6,7,8,9 In addition, 3-substituted benzofurans act as anticancer agents,10 antitubercular agents,11 antimicrobial agents,12 antiviral agents,13 and anti-inflammatory agents.14 They also act as enzyme inhibitors,15,16 ischemic cell death inhibitors,17 receptor agonist-antagonists,18 and use as diagnostic imaging agents targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.19 Although syntheses of 2-substituted or 2,3-disubstituted benzofurans are most common, the syntheses of 3-substituted benzofurans are rare.20,21,22,23,24 In 2004, our group reported an unprecedented reaction of acrylate formation from readily available aldehydes starting materials and ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) in the presence of Br\u00f8nsted acid, HBF4\u2219OEt2.25 While studying the substrate scope of benzaldehydes to prepare substituted 3-hydroxyacrylates, our group reacted salicylaldehyde with EDA and isolated a very low mass of acrylates with a larger portion of the hemiacetal, 3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrofuran. The hemiacetal underwent dehydration in the presence of concentrated H2SO4 to form the 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran. The general scope of the reaction was also investigated using various commercially available substituted salicylaldehydes and EDA. The acid catalyzed dehydration via cyclization produced the products in excellent yields.26\nAlternate methods to prepare 3-alkoxycarbonyl benzofurans\nMost alternate syntheses of 3-alkoxycarbonyl benzofuran involve transition metal catalysis. In 1982, Ortar et al. reported the synthesis of 3-methoxycarbonyl benzofurans by the oxidation reaction of chromanones with excess thallium trinitrate (TTN) in methanol in the presence of trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF). The product was isolated as a pale-yellow liquid in only 23% yield (Scheme 1).27\nScheme 1. Synthesis by a thallium catalyzed oxidation annulation\nHenke and coworkers reported a new synthetic route to 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran (Scheme 2a).28 In this two-step procedure, the first step involved the Michael addition of 2-bromophenol with ethyl propionate in the presence of trimethylamine to prepare 3-(2-bromophenoxy)-acrylic acid ethyl ester. Second, a palladium-catalyzed intramolecular Heck coupling of the 3-(2-bromophenoxy)acrylic acid ester created 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran as a yellow oil in 61% yield.\nLater, Frontier et al. applied a similar synthetic strategy as reported by Henke et al.28 involving 3-(2-iodophenoxy)acrylic acid ethyl ester to prepare 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran in 74% yield (Scheme 2b).29 The ester was produced from the reaction of 2-iodophenol and ethyl propionate in the presence of N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\nWang and coworkers reported the formation of 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran in 81% yield from (E)-3-phenoxyacrylates through the direct oxidative cyclization by a palladium catalyst (Scheme 2c).30 The corresponding acrylates were prepared from phenol and propynoic acid ethyl ester in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO).\nScheme 2. Syntheses by a palladium-catalyzed cyclization\nMorice et al. reported the preparation of several 3-methoxycarbonyl benzofurans based on the conversion of 3-coumaranones into their corresponding triflates, followed by palladium assisted CO insertion reactions in methanol (Scheme 3).31 3-Coumaranones were prepared from o-methoxybenzoic acids with oxalyl chloride and diazomethane followed by decomposition of the diazo ketone in acetic acid/sodium acetate solution.\nScheme 3. Synthesis by a palladium assisted CO insertion\nKarchava et al. reported the preparation of 3-methoxycarbonyl benzofuran from hydroxyacrylates. First, the methyl-2-bromophenylacetates were treated with methyl formate in the presence of sodium hydride and after acidic work up, the mixture provided the acrylate product. Later, a copper-catalyzed cyclization of the acrylate produced 3-methoxycarbonyl benzofuran in 88% yield (Scheme 4).32\nScheme 4. Synthesis by a copper-catalyzed cyclization\nRecently, in 2016, Yao et al. reported the synthesis of 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran by a Rh(III)-catalyzed reaction between salicylaldehyde and ethyl 2-diazo-3-oxopropanoate in dichloroethane (DCE).33 Silver triflimide (AgNTf2) favored the formation of 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran via a tandem C-H activation/decarbonylation/annulation process in 72% yield (Scheme 5).\nScheme 5. Synthesis by a rhodium-catalyzed annulation\nApplications of our method in organic synthesis\nCompared to the alternative syntheses of 3-alkoxycarbonyl benzofuran, our synthetic method is simple, less time consuming, and high yielding with inexpensive and commercially available starting materials. This one-pot synthetic method has been used by us and by other groups in the preparation of several biologically active compounds as described herein.\nTelvekar and coworkers synthesized N'-benzylidene benzofuran-3-carbohydrazides from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofurans (Scheme 6).34 All these compounds were found to be active against tuberculosis and showed antifungal activity against Candida albicans.\nScheme 6. Synthesis of N'-benzylidene benzofuran-3-carbohydrazide\nEccles and coworkers synthesized several leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) inhibitors from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran (Scheme 7).35 LTA4H inhibitors are used in inflammatory diseases, such as bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma.\nScheme 7. Synthesis of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) inhibitor\nMorrow et al. synthesized pterocarpene and coumestan-type heterocycles by the Mitsunobu coupling of 3-(hydroxymethyl)benzofurans with o-iodophenols (Scheme 8).36 Pterocarpans have been shown to exhibit broad spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci. Coumestans, such as coumestrol and flemmichapparin C, have also been shown to display antibacterial, antifungal, and antimyotoxic effects.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of pterocarpenes and coumestans\nTolstikov et al. reported several regioselective Diels-Alder reactions of Danishefsky's diene with 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofurans (Scheme 9).37 These reactions provided effective method for the construction of the heterocyclic skeleton of hexahydrodibenzofuran-7-one and tetrahydrodibenzofuran-7-one. These tricyclic fragments are the structural motifs of many pharmacologically vital substances, such as plant alkaloids morphine, galanthamine, lycoramine, and lunarine, linderol A, and several selective estrogen receptor \u03b2 -agonists.\nScheme 9. Construction of heterocyclic skeleton\nElofsson and coworkers constructed a library based on the 3-carboxy 2-aryl benzofuran scaffold from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran (Scheme 10).38 These two scaffolds are core components in many biologically active natural and synthetic compounds of which many display a wide range of activities including antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antimitotic activities.\nScheme 10. Synthesis of 2-arylbenzofuran-3-carboxamide derivatives\nZhao et al. reported a total synthesis of paeoveitol, the norditerpene natural product which has antidepressant ability, from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran (Scheme 11).39 Our published procedure was employed to synthesize 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran, which was reduced to paeoveitol D. Paeoveitol was synthesized by an unusual intermolecular ortho-quinone methide cycloaddition with paeoveitol D with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity.\nScheme 11. Total synthesis of paeoveitol via paeoveitol D\nLater, Chen and coworkers reported the first catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-paeoveitol and (-)-paeoveitol from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran via a biomimetic hetero-Diels-Alder reaction in the presence of chiral phosphoric acids as catalysts (Scheme 12).40\nScheme 12. Asymmetric synthesis of (+)-paeoveitol and (-)-paeoveitol\nBongen et al. reported an efficient asymmetric synthesis of 7-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylic acid, BRL-37959 (Scheme 13).41 3-Ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran was reduced by magnesium turnings in methanol to form 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, which was resolved by dynamic kinetic resolution. Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction of the enantiopure product followed by acidic hydrolysis produced (R)-BRL-37959, which acts as analgesic agents with low gas irritancy.5\nScheme 13. Synthesis of enantiopure (R)-BRL-37959\nRecently, in 2018, our group reported the synthesis of 7-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylic acid, BRL-37959 and its analogs from 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran (Scheme 14).42 To synthesize BRL-37959, incorporation of a benzoyl group at the C-6 position of benzofuran ring by the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction was the main challenge. Our recent method demonstrates that bismuth (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate can be used as a catalyst for the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction with good yield. This efficient method allowed the production of many analogs of BRL-37959 in high yield.\nScheme 14. Synthesis of BRL-37959 and its analogs\nIn summary, 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran plays a pivotal role in the field of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. The concise synthesis of 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran was reported by our group with excellent yield from commercially available starting materials. In this addendum, we discussed several alternate methods for the preparation of 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran and applications of our published method to synthesize important biologically active compounds. In the future, our developed method of preparing 3-ethoxycarbonyl benzofuran could be a valuable procedure in making benzofuran-ring containing natural and unnatural products."

            "There has been remarkable progress in organophosphine-catalyzed reactions,2 especially the processes involving [4C+X] annulations, because of their potential application in building 5-8-membered cyclic products. The phosphine-catalyzed [4 + 2] annulation between 2-alkyl-but-2,3-dienoates and aldimines, first reported by our group in 2003, has become a powerful tool in the construction of substituted tetrahydropyridine derivatives (Scheme 1).3 According to the generally accepted mechanism, nucleophilic addition of tri-n-butylphosphine to the \u03b2-position of \u03b1-alkyl allenoates results in the formation of a resonance stabilized zwitterionic species A. The nucleophilic addition of the enolate A into N-tosylimine 2 produces sulfonamide B. Through proton transfer, the species B equilibrates with the vinylogous phosphonium ylide C/D. One more proton transfer facilitates the formation of the sulfonamide anion in E, which undergoes conjugate addition to the \u03b1, \u03b2 -enoate, followed by \u03b2 -elimination of tributylphosphine, resulting in the formation of tetrahydropyridine 3. This Discussion Addendum focuses on new developments of this [4 + 2] annulation-including its asymmetric versions and synthetic utility-since 2003.\nScheme 1. Mechanism for \u03b1-alkylallenoate-imine [4 + 2] annulation by Kwon\nWhen reacting 2-substituted 2,3-butadienoates and N-tosylimines in the presence of tributylphosphine, Kwon's [4 + 2] annulation proceeds to afford tetrahydropyridines with high efficiency and diastereoselectivity. Specifically, ethyl \u03b1 -methylallenoate undergoes the [4 + 2] annulation with a variety of N-tosylarylimines to provide tetrahydropyridines, typically in over 90% isolated yields. The allene-imine [4 + 2] annulation is a robust process, with the gram-scale preparation of tetrahydropyridines having been reported.3\nWhile 2-methyl-2,3-butadienoate undergoes efficient [4 + 2] annulations with N-tosylimines, 3-methyl-3,4-pentadienone experiences a surprising cascade event, incorporating two molecules of the imine in the process. For instance, in 2005 Shi presented a rare example for the synthesis of cinnamyl tetrahydropyridyl ketone from 3-methyl-3,4-pentadienone and N-tosylimines in the presence of tributylphosphine (Scheme 2).4 This reaction generated the phosphonium enolate G as the intermediate responsible for incorporating another unit of the imine and affording the corresponding cinnamyl tetrahydropyridyl ketone.\nScheme 2. Shi's formation of tetrahydropyridine derivatives\nLater in 2012, Ye and co-workers employed saccharin-derived cyclic ketimines in [4 + 2] annulations, allowing rapid access to a variety of functionalized tricyclic tetrahydropyridines in good yields (Scheme 3).5\nScheme 3. Ye's synthesis of functionalized polycyclic tetrahydro-pyridines\nIn 2014, Guo and co-workers identified cyclic sulfamate as the imine component of the phosphine-catalyzed [4 + 2] annulation protocol (Scheme 4).6 The reaction was efficient at producing the tricyclic sulfamate 8 in high yield.\nScheme 4. Guo's preparation of functionalized tetrahydropyridines\nEnantioselective Allene-Imine [4 + 2] Annulation: A few asymmetric versions of Kwon's allene-imine [4 + 2] annulation have been reported. In 2005, Fu demonstrated an elegant example of the asymmetric [4 + 2] reaction, generating functionalized tetrahydropyridines when employing Gladiali's phosphepine (R)-P1 as the catalyst (Scheme 5).7 The reactions provided tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyridines in almost quantitative yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities. A vinylidenesuccinate, namely \u03b1 -ethoxycarbonylmethylallenoate, was applied to ensure high reactivity and selectivity.\nScheme 5. Fu's asymmetric allene-imine [4 + 2] annulations\nIn 2011, Zhao introduced an amino acid-derived bifunctional N-acyl aminophosphine catalyst P2 for the asymmetric allene-imine [4 + 2] annulation.8 This reaction gave series of chiral tetrahydropyridine derivatives in excellent yields with high enantioselectivities (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6. Zhao's enantioselective preparation of tetrahydropyridines\nSasai reported enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic tetrahydropyridines from cyclic sulfonylimines in 2014 (Scheme 7).9 The chiral spiro-phosphepine catalyst (R)-SITCP (P3) promoted enantioselective formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition of saccharin-derived ketimines and ethyl \u03b1-methylallenoate. These reactions afforded the tricyclic tetrahydropyridines in good yields and enantiomeric excesses with excellent regioselectivity.\nScheme 7. Sasai's asymmetric synthesis of functionalized tricyclic tetrahydropyridines\nIn the same year, Guo and co-workers demonstrated that enantioenriched cyclic sulfamates were formed when using the amino acid-based bifunctional phosphine P4 as the chiral catalyst (Scheme 8).10 This asymmetric [4 + 2] cycloaddition furnished chiral sulfamate-fused tetrahydropyridines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.\nScheme 8. Guo's asymmetric synthesis of cyclic sulfamates\nMost recently, in 2018 our group reported the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of guvacine derivatives through [4 + 2] annulations of imines with \u03b1-methylallenoates.11 A P-chiral [2.2.1] bicyclic phosphine, exo-(p-anisyl)-HypPhos (P5), was applied in reactions between \u03b1 -alkylallenoates and imines, producing enantioenriched guvacine derivatives (Scheme 9). This method was applied for the synthesis of enantiopure aplexone 10 through a high-yielding Tebbe olefination/hydrolysis sequence. Phenotypic assay of both aplexones with zebrafish embryos revealed that (R)-aplexone was responsible for the decreased cellular levels of cholesterol in zebrafish embryos.\nScheme 9. Kwon's catalytic enantioselective synthesis of guvacine derivatives\nApplication of [4+2] annulation reaction: The potential of the allene-imine [4 + 2] annulation reaction in the total synthesis of natural product was first illustrated in the formal synthesis of (\u00b1)-alstonerine (Scheme 10).12 The treatment of diethyl 2-vinylidenesuccinate and the indole imine 11 with catalytic PBu3 afforded the indolytetrahydropyridine 12 in good yield with 3:1 dr. The tetrahydropyridine 12 was then converted to the known intermediate 13 in excellent yield by a sequence of six-step transformations, including Friedel-Crafts acylation, nosyl group deprotection, methylation of the amine, reductive deoxygenation, selective 1,2-reduction of the ethyl ester. Cook and co-workers had previously reported the total synthesis of (-)-alstonerine (14) from the allyl alcohol 13.13,14\nScheme 10. Kwon's formal total synthesis of (\u00b1)-alstonerine\nIn 2012, our group applied a similar [4 + 2] annulation of ethyl \u03b1-methylallenoate with imine to the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-hirsutine (Scheme 11).15 The phosphine-catalyzed [4 + 2] annulation of the crude N-(o-nosyl)imine with ethyl \u03b1-methylallenoate afforded tetrahydropyridine in 73% yield over two steps. The formation of tetrahydropyridine in good yield from the crude imine revealed the robustness of this reaction. Subsequent functional group manipulations resulted in the construction of the C-ring and completed the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-hirsutine with good efficiency.\nScheme 11. Kwon's total synthesis of (\u00b1)-hirsutine\nLater in 2012, our research group performed a concise preparation of the pentacyclic framework of reserpine (Scheme 12).16 The [4 + 2] annulation between N-(o-nosyl)imine and ethyl \u03b1-methylallenoate in the presence of catalytic PBu3 afforded, in good yield, a tetrahydropyridine intermediate having A-, B-, and D-rings of reserpine. Further construction of the C-ring in two steps from a key intermediate, and subsequent 6\u03c0-electrocyclization to form the E-ring, provided the reserpine's pentacyclic scaffold 16.\nScheme 12. Kwon's access to the skeletal framework of reserpine\nIn 2007, our research group reported the first example of phosphine catalysis using polystyrene-bound allenoates for the preparation of a combinatorial library and the identification of potent inhibitors of protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) and Rab geranylgeranyltransferase as potential anticancer therapeutics.17,18,19\nUsing SynPhase lanterns grafted with Wang resin, allenoic acids were coupled to the benzyl alcohol units of the Wang linker to install resin-bound allenoates 17 (Scheme 13). Through the split-and-pool strategy, extensive arrays of allenoic acid, imine, and thiol building blocks were incorporated, leading to the production of 4288 compounds, including a vast variety of functionalized tetrahydropyridines, pyrrolines, pyrrolidines, and piperidines. In vitro assays revealed that the pyrroline 18 and the tetrahydropyridine 19 both displayed submicromolar IC50 values against GGTase-I.\nScheme 13. Kwon's phosphine-catalyzed synthesis of GGTase-I inhibitor libraries\nA derivative of the pyrroline 18 displayed in vivo efficacy against solid pancreatic tumor and lung cancer models in mice, hinting at the possibility of developing novel anticancer therapeutic leads.20,21\nPhosphine catalysis of imines and allenoates produces pyrrolines and tetrahydropyridines that possess the \u03b1, \u03b2 -unsaturated carboxylic ester functional group, which can be transformed into multicyclic scaffolds. In 2011, our group disclosed the diversity-oriented synthesis of a chemical library comprising 91 polyheterocyclic compounds with 16 distinct scaffolds (Scheme 14).22,23 The \u03b1, \u03b2 -enoate units contained within pyrrolines and tetrahydropyridines were converted to the corresponding dienol ethers through Tebbe olefination, and subsequently underwent Diels-Alder reactions with various dienophiles, providing densely functionalized polyheterocyclic compounds. Delightfully, compound 20-22 displayed subtoxic antimigratory activity against MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.\nScheme 14. Kwon's diversity-oriented synthesis of a polyheterocyclic compound library\nTaking advantage of the facile preparation of the Wang resin-bound tetrahydropyridines, a library of octahydro-1,6-naphthyridin-4-ones was built through split-pool synthesis on a solid phase.24,25 Again, allenoic acids were coupled to the Wang resin, followed by [4 + 2] annulations with imines in the presence of tributylphosphine (Scheme 15).\nScheme 15. Kwon's formation of octahydro-1,6-naphthyridin-4-ones\nThe resulting tetrahydropyridine carboxylate esters 23 were treated with Tebbe reagent and then subjected to Diels-Alder reactions with imines. Notably, the same imine building blocks were used in both the phosphine catalysis and the Diels-Alder reactions. Highly diastereoselective hydrolysis of the octahydronaphthyridines 24 occurred upon simple treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), releasing the naphthyridinones 25.\nAmong the 96 naphthyridinones, five distinctive octahydro-1,6-naphthyridin-4-ones 26-30 displayed excellent activation of endothelial cell triggered induction of innate immune response (Scheme 16). These studies illustrate the potential utility of the products of phosphine catalysis. The ready translation of the original phosphine-catalyzed reactions from solution to the solid phase enables the facile preparation of analogues through split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis-\u03b1 crucial aspect of modern chemical biology.\nScheme 16. Kwon's immunoactivating octahydro-1,6- naphthyridin-4-ones\nSeveral advances in enhancing the utility of the [4 + 2] annulations have been realized in recent years. These reactions have proved to be generally efficient in many varied settings, including in solid-phase and under the influence of chiral phosphines. Because a tetrahydropyridine core appears in countless natural products and bio-active molecules, we anticipate that these [4 + 2] annulations between allene and imine will continue to find use in valuable product syntheses, especially those for which mild conditions, robust efficiency, and high selectivity are paramount."

            "Benzyl ethers are important protecting groups in organic synthesis2, but traditional installation methods, such as the Williamson ether synthesis or reaction of an alcohol with benzyl trichloroacetimidate, often limit their formation with substrates containing functional groups unable to tolerate strongly basic or acidic conditions, respectively.3 As a complementary option, we offered 2-benzyloxy-1-methylpyridinium triflate (BnOPT, 1).4 Benzyl transfer occurs upon mild heating in the presence of an alcohol. The proposed mechanism for the benzylation involves an SN1-like pathway in which thermal ionization of BnOPT produces a reactive phenylcarbenium species which is then trapped by a nucleophilic alcohol. The thermal and nearly neutral conditions circumvent the need for relatively harsh reagents in the reaction mixture.5,6,7\nIn our initial reports, we described the reactivity of simple alcohols with BnOPT (Table 1).5 Primary and secondary alcohols (2-5) produce the corresponding benzyl ethers in good to excellent yields, while tertiary alcohols (6-7) provide variable results that appear to depend on the susceptibility to E1-like elimination. Simple phenols can also be benzylated; however, protocols using Mitsunobu conditions8 are generally superior with respect to the efficiency of the reaction.\nTable 1. Benzylation of representative substrates using BnOPT\nCarboxylic acids are viable substrates for benzylation (Table 1).6 Alkyl (9), vinyl (10), alkynyl (11), and aryl carboxylic acids (12) all react smoothly in forming benzyl esters in excellent yields. Triethylamine (Et3N) is the optimal base for efficient esterification, in contrast to MgO for benzyl etherification of alcohols. (This change in base can impact chemoselectivity; vide infra.)5,6\nArenes are susceptible to Friedel-Crafts benzylation under similar mild thermal conditions (Table 1, 13-17).7 Electron-rich arenes react the fastest providing good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the reaction of N,N-dimethylaniline (22) occurred via an N-methyl to benzyl exchange instead of the expected electrophilic aromatic substitution (Scheme 1). This illustrates that amines can also trap the putative phenylcarbenium species released during the thermal activation of BnOPT.\nBenzylation can generally be achieved chemoselectively using BnOPT with Et3N in the presence of alcohols, amides, and other functional groups. The base not only activates the carboxylic acid, but it also impedes further reaction by quenching excess benzyl electrophiles.6 Esters 18-21 were all obtained in high yields without evidence of the competing ether formation or N-benzylation. On the other hand, chemoselective benzylation of alcohols can also be achieved using BnOPT with MgO, including in the presence of carboxylic acids (vide infra, especially 48 in Figure 2).\nScheme 1. N-methyl - benzyl exchange between BnOPT and N,N-dimethylaniline\nSince our 2007 Organic Syntheses report, which described the optimized preparation of BnOPT, its effectiveness in the protection of alcohols has been noted in many literature reports (Figure 1).9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 The benzyl ethers of simple primary and secondary alcohols (24-30) were obtained in good to excellent yields (60-95%).9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Many of these benzylations were not (or would not likely have been) successful under traditional Williamson ether and trichloroacetimidate reaction conditions, owing to their respective requirements for basic and acidic conditions.\nFigure 1. Protection of various alcohols using BnOPT\nBnOPT can also benzylate an \u03b1-hydroxyalkylboronate ester (31) with a modest yield of 33%.16 Although the yield was modest, this is the first report for this kind of substrate. Likewise, Kato and Sodeoka showed that 4-O-benzyl monosaccharide 32 can be obtained directly from the unreactive 4-hydroxygalactoside using BnOPT.17 Previous attempts to furnish the ether using standard benzylation protocols were unsuccessful due to the presence of a benzoyl neighboring group.\nTaber and Nelson reported a particularly interesting example in 2011: their target ether 33 was obtained with retention of carbinol stereochemistry, while the basic conditions of Williamson etherification provided the epimeric ether with complete inversion at the carbinol center.18\nSyntheses of 34 and 39 were troublesome using traditional methods because the harsh conditions produced complex mixture of products. The use of BnOPT provided optimal yields of the desired products.19,24 Similarly, 35, 37 and 38 avoided elimination, lactonization and formation of cyclic phosphates, respectively, when synthesized in the neutral medium.20,22,24 Ethers 36, 40, 41 and 42 were also successfully produced without decomposition of the starting material.21,25,26,27\nThe mild and nearly neutral conditions associated with the use of BnOPT is the main advantage of the benzylation protocol. Additional examples of chemoselectivity in the presence of potentially labile functional groups are presented in Figure 2. Benzylation using the standard conditions provided ethers 43-47 in good yields (70-95%).28,29,30,31,32 No reactions involving the nitrogen functionality were observed. In 2014, Reynolds and co-workers were able to benzylate the hydroxyl group of 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid.33 The group was able to deactivate the carboxylic acid and obtain ether 48 in 76% yield using MgO as the acid scavenger. In the same year, the group of Shibasaki obtained 49 in 38% yield from the reaction of a diol with BnOPT.34 Interestingly, the doubly benzylated product was not formed despite using 3 equiv of the salt.\nFigure 2. Selective benzylation of alcohols\nBnOPT was utilized by Lassaletta and co-workers in 2010 with a nitrogen-based nucleophile after conventional alkylating methods resulted in S-benzylation instead of the desired N-benzylated product (Scheme 2).35 Here, the reaction was conducted at room temperature using polar solvents.\nScheme 2. BnOPT benzylation of an amine\nThermal benzylation using BnOPT can also be conducted under microwave heating, as outlined in Table 2.36 Yields from the microwave reactions were often (but not always) higher than analogous reactions conducted under conventional heating, and the stoichiometry of BnOPT in many cases could be reduced from 2.0 equiv to 1.2 equiv under microwave heating. Reaction times were systematically reduced, as would be expected due to conducting the microwave reactions at higher temperatures.\nTable 2. MW-assisted benzyl transfer reactions of BnOPT with various substrates\nMicrowave-specific heating effects on thermal benzyl transfer reactions have been reported using an analog of BnOPT in which the triflate anion is replaced with the tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (BArF) anion using a simple metathesis reaction (Scheme 3).37 The resulting 2-benzyloxy-1-methylpyridinium BArF salt (BnOPB, 53) is more lipophilic and hydrocarbon-soluble than BnOPT.\nScheme 3. Synthesis of BnOPB\nLike benzyl ethers, para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers can also be synthesized using transfer salts. The reactive lepidinium intermediate 55 is generated in situ upon treatment of the lepidine derivative 54 with MeOTf at 0 \u00b0C (Scheme 4). The PMB transfer to alcohols occurs within 30-60 mins at room temperature to afford the corresponding ethers. Magnesium oxide (MgO) is included as an acid scavenger to help maintain neutral conditions.38 Paquette and co-workers reported a variation of the procedure that does not require the use of MeOTf, in which PMBO-lepidine is activated using methyl tosylate or camphorsulfonic acid, and MgO is not employed.39\nScheme 4. Synthesis of PMB ethers\nAnalogs of BnOPT that incorporate halogens (Cl, Br and I) have been developed to prepare halobenzyl ethers,40 which create additional flexibility in benzyl protecting group strategies.41 The Albiniak group has continued to expand the utility of oxypyridinium salts with a focus on varying the electrophilic transfer component. In 2014, the in situ generation of 2-tert-butoxy-1-methylpyridinium triflate (58) for the etherification of alcohols was reported (Scheme 5).42 Transfer of the t-butyl group onto an acceptor alcohol is significantly faster than benzyl transfer using BnOPT; it is typically complete within 1.5 h at 23 \u00b0C as opposed to 24 h at 83 \u00b0C. This procedure allows for the facile synthesis of t-butyl ethers without the need for isobutylene gas, or acidic or basic additives.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of t-butyl ethers\n2-Allyloxy-1-methylpyridinium triflate can be generated in situ and employed as an allyl source for converting carboxylic acids into the corresponding allyl esters (Scheme 6).43 As opposed to the benzylation of carboxylic acids with BnOPT, Et3N was not a very efficient base for this transformation, but more reactive conditions using K2CO3 were required. The reaction times were also much shorter for allyl esterification (1-2 vs. 24 h) and the crude product mixtures contained some of the corresponding methyl ester product. These results suggest that the allyl transfer mechanism is more dependent on the nucleophilic partner, and may be less SN1-like. The desired products were obtained in high yields under neutral conditions making the procedure a valuable option for allylations.\nScheme 6. Synthesis of allyl esters\nBnOPT is unique as it is preactivated, effective under neutral, mild conditions, and it does not disturb many sensitive functional groups in complex molecules. The literature reports mentioned earlier in the text are testaments to this, making the salt an important and generally applicable tool for the benzylation of alcohols and other functional groups. With the added convenience of MW heating, and the introduction of new derivatives to transfer other reactive electrophilic components, these protocols add versatility to protecting group strategies in organic synthesis."

The flask is fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser and clamped above an oil bath on a digitally controlled hot-plate/stirrer, which is on a support jack (Figure 1A). Acetonitrile (Note 5) (40 mL) is added to the reaction flask resulting in a turbid suspension. The support jack is used to raise the oil bath and stirring is commenced with a stir rate of ~250 rpm (Figure 1). m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) (Note 6) (11.7 g, 67.8 mmol, 1.36 equiv) is added to the reaction flask in one portion, via a powder funnel inserted in the side neck, followed by additional acetonitrile (10 mL); the resulting reaction mixture is an off-white suspension (Figure 1B). The side neck is sealed with a rubber septum and heating is commenced; the oil bath temperature is increased from 24 \u00b0C to 75 \u00b0C (oil bath temperature) over a period of 20 min (rate of increase ~ 1.25 \u00b0C/min) (Note 7).

A 100 mL, single-necked round-bottomed-flask (RBF) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (12 x 25 mm, oval) is charged with AuBr3 (1.0 g, 2.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Notes 2 and 3) followed by EtOH (20 mL) (Note 4) and the mixture is stirred (400 rpm, under air) for 1 min at 23-25 \u00baC. Tetrahydrothiophene (222 mg, 222 \u03bcL, 2.5 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 5) is dissolved in EtOH (3 mL) in a 5 mL vial and added dropwise to the AuBr3 solution over ~3 min, forming a red crystalline precipitate (Figure 1A). The vial is rinsed with additional EtOH (1 mL) and this is added to the reaction mixture in one portion. After stirring for an additional 3 min, heptane (70 mL) (Note 6) is added in one portion. The RBF is then placed in an acetone bath cooled with liquid nitrogen (roughly -80 \u00b0C) (Note 7) and stirred for 3 min (400 rpm) (Figure 1B). The resulting precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration (55 mm filter paper) (Note 8) to give a dark red-brown solid (Figure 1C). The RBF is rinsed with heptane (~20 mL) using a wash bottle, and the remaining material is also collected by filtration. The combined solids are then washed with heptane (3 \u00d7 20 mL) and transferred to a 100 mL RBF by dissolution through the filter paper with CH2Cl2 (~70-80 mL, in portions) (Note 9) before concentration by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (550 to 7.5 mmHg) to give a red-brown solid (1.14 g, 95 % mass return). Hot (90 \u00b0C) toluene (52 mL, 45 mL/g) (Note 10) is added to the 100 mL RBF, and this solution is swirled by hand to dissolve material on the sides of the flask. Once the majority of material is dissolved, the RBF is placed in an oil bath at 90 \u00b0C while a filtration apparatus is prepared. A hot filtration is carried out collecting the filtrate in a conical flask (Note 11), the RBF is rinsed with additional hot toluene (~3 mL, 3 mL/g) and this is also filtered. The conical flask is placed in the oil bath at 90 \u00b0C and the solution is stirred (Teflon-coated cylindrical magnetic stirbar, 8 x 30 mm, 400 rpm) for 2 min, hot (~90 \u00b0C) heptane (17 mL, 15 mL/g) is added over ~1-2 min with stirring. The conical flask is removed from the oil bath and the dark red solution is allowed to cool at 23-26 \u00baC over 1 h. The opening of the flask is covered with Parafilm M before being placed in a fridge (0 \u00b0C) for 3 h then moved to a freezer (-20 \u00b0C) overnight (~16 h). The resulting crystals are collected by filtration using a Hirsch funnel (filter paper 1 cm diameter, house vacuum) (Figure 1D). Crystals remaining in the conical flask are rinsed onto the filter paper using a wash bottle filled with heptane:toluene 4:1 (~20 mL) and the combined crystals are washed with additional heptane:toluene 4:1 (2 x 15 mL). The crystals are then dried on the Hirsch funnel under vacuum with an inverted funnel dispensing nitrogen gas for 5 min. The resulting dark-red needles are collected in a vial and stored in the fridge (0.97 g, 80%) (Figure 1E) (Notes 12 and 14).\nFigure 1. (A) Reaction mixture after addition of tetrahydrothiophene.

The RBF is fitted with a reflux condenser (air cooling only) and placed in an oil bath heated to 50 \u00b0C (Figures 2A and B). The reaction mixture is stirred (500 rpm) at this temperature over 18 h (Figure 2C). The RBF is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to 23-25 \u00baC with stirring (~30 min). The reaction mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel (pore size 3) under suction (vacuum) and the RBF/K2CO3 is rinsed with acetone (2 x 30 mL) which is also filtered. The combined filtrates are concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (300 to 75 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum pump (<1 mmHg) to remove any trace of acetone. The crude material is dissolved in petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C, 20 mL) (Note 18) and passed through a silica gel plug (Figure 2D) (Notes 19 and 20) under vacuum. The RBF containing the crude material is rinsed with additional petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C, 2 x 20 mL) and this is also passed through the silica gel plug. Remaining product is eluted through the plug with petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C, 350 mL) under suction and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (300 to 7.5 mmHg) to obtain 13.02 g (99%) of 1-Bromo-2-(phenoxymethyl)benzene (2) as a clear, colorless oil which can spontaneously solidify over time to provide a white crystalline solid (Figures 2E and 2F) (Notes 21 and 21).\nFigure 2.

Remaining 2 is dissolved in additional THF (2 x 20 mL) and added to the 2-necked RBF in the same manner (Figures 3A and B). Additional THF (30 mL) is added and the RBF is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath at -78 \u00b0C and stirred (350 rpm) (Figure 3C). n-BuLi (2.25 M in hexanes, 22.9 mL, 51.5 mmol, 1.04 equiv) (Note 24) is added slowly via syringe over ~15 min (Note 25), causing the reaction mixture to develop a pale orange/yellow color (Figure 3D). The reaction is stirred for 5 min at -78 \u00b0C before addition of TMSCl (7.6 mL, 60 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 26) over ~5 min (Note 27) via syringe, resulting in a colorless solution (Figure 3E). The RBF is removed from the dry ice/acetone bath and allowed to warm to 23-26 \u00baC with stirring over ~45 min (Figure 3F). The reaction mixture is quenched with deionised water (20 mL), transferred to a 250 mL separating funnel using Et2O (~30 mL) (Note 28) to rinse the RBF and the layers are separated.\nThe aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (30 mL) and the combined organic portions are washed with brine (30 mL) (Note 29), dried over magnesium sulfate (5 g) for 5 min (Note 30) and then filtered through a funnel plugged with cotton wool. The flask is rinsed with Et2O (30 mL) and this is also passed through the cotton wool plug before concentration by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (600 to 7.5 mmHg).

The column is equilibrated using petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C):Et2O (97:3), the crude material loaded onto the column in petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C) (5 mL) and eluted with 1.0 L of petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C):Et2O (97:3) followed by 1.0 L of petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C):Et2O (96:4) and 500 mL of petroleum ether (bp 40-60 \u00b0C):Et2O (95:5). The first ~1.5 L is discarded, then fractions are collected in test tubes (25 mL volume). The desired product is obtained in fractions 20-51 (Notes 42 and 43). These are concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C (375 to 7.5 mmHg) to give 6H-benzo[c]chromene as a clear oil (4.07 g, 68%) (Figure 4F (Notes 44 and 45)."

            "One of the most efficient methodologies to prepare amines is the addition of organometallic reagents to imines.2 From a synthetic point of view, the corresponding allylation presents special interest due to the possible transformation of the introduced carbon-carbon double bond into other functionalities.3 The asymmetric version of this process, both in an enantio-4 or diastereoselective5 catalytic fashion, allows the preparation of chiral homoallylic amines, useful starting materials in synthetic organic chemistry.6 Among different possibilities, one way to activate the C=N bond in imines and at the same time to introduce asymmetric information in the starting material, is the use of N-sulfinyl imines (mainly aldimines) as electrophiles in the reaction with allylic organometallic compounds.7 As activated imines, N-tert-butylsulfinyl derivatives8 have been extensively used, and as metallic components, allylmagnesium,9 allylzinc10 and allylindium11 reagents were successfully employed. Some years ago, we found that a convenient method to allylate N-tert-butylsulfinyl aldimines in a diastereoselective manner is the use of an allyl bromide and indium metal in THF at 60 \u00baC.12 The combination of this methodology with the easy deprotection of the sulfinyl moiety under acidic conditions represents an useful procedure to prepare enantiomerically enriched homoallylic primary amines: Scheme 1 shows an example of this process. The transition state I can explain the obtained stereochemical outcome. This procedure was further extended to ketimines with similar results.13\nScheme 1. First In-promoted allylation of N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines\nThe most commonly used method to prepare the starting enantiomerically pure N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines is the direct reaction of the corresponding carbonyl compounds with enantiomerically pure commercially available tert-butanesulfinamides and titanium tetraethoxide under thermal14 or microwave15 activation. Other procedures starting from epoxides16 or allylic alcohols and aryl iodides17 are complementary but not so general.\nIn-promoted allylation of N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines18\nThe method shown in Scheme 1 has been further improved without the need of isolating the starting imine. Thus, after reacting an aldehyde and the chiral sulfinamide in the presence of titanium tetraethoxide and indium powder for one hour, allyl bromide is added and the mixture heated at 60 \u00baC. In this one-pot procedure the anticipated protected homoallylamine is obtained as illustrated in Scheme 2.19 The reaction is rather general concerning the starting aldehyde and has been applied to other allylic bromides with good yields (82-89%) and high diastereoselectivities (90:10->99:1). It is remarkable that in the case of prenyl bromide20 only \u03b3-attack was observed.\nScheme 2. One-pot procedure to allylate in situ generated sulfinyl imines\nAnother version of the reaction depicted in Scheme 1 has been performed under aqueous conditions.11b An example is shown in Scheme 3 for the allylation of the same imine using a saturated solution of sodium bromide at room temperature.\nScheme 3. In-promoted allylation of a chiral N-tert-butylsulfinyl imine under aqueous conditions\nWhen the one-pot procedure described in Scheme 2 was applied to pentadienyl bromide a \u03b3-attack was also observed giving the corresponding pentadienyl product in low yield as shown in Scheme 4 for the same imine.21\nScheme 4. One-pot In-promoted pentadienylation of an in situ generated N-tert-butylsulfinyl imine\nIn addition, the allylic bromide component can bear an ester group and the reaction works in the same way as allyl bromide giving multifunctionalized amines as exemplified in Scheme 5 for the reaction in THF22 or under aqueous conditions.23\nScheme 5. In-promoted allylation of an N-tert-butylsulfinyl aldimine with ethyl 2-(bromoethyl)acrylate\nFinally, the same protocol described for the In-promoted allylation of chiral N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines has been successfully applied to propargyl bromides to access diastereo- and regioselectively to homopropargylic amines.24\nSynthetic applications of chiral N-sulfinyl homoallylic amines25\nOnce chiral N-tert-butylsulfinyl homoallylic amines were prepared, their oxidation with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) yielded the corresponding sulfonyl epoxides as a ca. 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers concerning the new stereocenter formed. The application of the Jacobsen kinetic resolution26 to the mixture of epoxides gave a ca. 1:1 mixture of enantiomerically pure diols and epoxides, which were easily separated by column chromatography. The transformation of the diols into the epoxides can be easily performed by standard methodologies: (1) protection of the terminal alcohols as their pivalates, (2) mesylation of the secondary alcohols, and (3) deprotection of the primary alcohols and epoxidation under basic conditions. The enantiomerically pure epoxides were transformed into azetidines or pyrrolidines by treatment with potassium carbonate and potassium iodide in the second case (involving an iodohydrin intermediate) (Scheme 6).27\nScheme 6. Preparation of chiral azetidines and pyrrolidines from N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines by a tandem epoxidation/kinetic resolution/cyclization\nN-tert-Butylsulfinyl imines derived from \u03b1-keto aldehydes28a or \u03b1-keto esters28b have been allylated in the presence of indium powder to give the corresponding allylated products in a diastereoselective manner. In the first case, using an excess of the allylic component resulted in diallylation giving a diene that by ring-closing metathesis gave the expected chiral N-protected 2-aminocyclohexanol, as it is illustrated in Scheme 7.\nScheme 7. Diallylation of an \u03b1-keto N-tert-butylsulfinyl imine and ring-closing metathesis\nWhen N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines derived from ortho-bromo carbonyl compounds were allylated in the presence of In, the protected amines were obtained with high yields and stereoselectivities. These compounds were submitted to a Heck-type reaction to yield chiral exo-methylenic indenylamines. An example is illustrated in Scheme 8.29\nScheme 8. Tandem allylation/Heck-type reaction of an o-bromo sulfinyl imine\nFrom a synthetic point of view the most important application of allylated N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines is the preparation of alkaloids.25 Scheme 9 shows a simple access to piperidine-derived natural products: the starting homoallyl amines were treated with methyl vinyl ketone in the presence of catalyst C2 to give enones, that after (1) hydrogenation, (2) deprotection and (3) reduction suffer cyclization to afford natural venom alkaloids of fire ants, isolated as their hydrochlorides.30\nScheme 9. Preparation of chiral cis-2,6-disubstituted piperidines\nThe corresponding trans-2,6-disubstituted piperidines were prepared just changing the reduction step in Scheme 9. One example depicted in Scheme 10 is the synthesis of (+)-solenopsin, an alkaloid also isolated from fire ants: after isolation of the tetrahydropyridine intermediate it was reduced diastereoselectively with AlMe3/LiAlH4 at low temperature to give the mentioned alkaloid.31\nScheme 10. Synthesis of (+)-solenopsin\nOne interesting compound that can be further elaborated in order to prepare natural alkaloids is chiral 2-allylpiperidine. For this purpose \u03b4-bromopentanal was allylated and cyclized in situ to give the expected N-tert-butylsulfinyl 2-allylpiperidine, which was easily deprotected to afford the corresponding amine hydrochloride (Scheme 11).32\nScheme 11. Preparation of chiral 2-allylpiperidine\nThe simple hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C cat., MeOH) of the prepared chiral 2-allylpiperidine afforded (+)-coniine (78%), the major alkaloid extracted from poison hemlock. The same starting material was transformed into the corresponding N-acryloyl derivative and then submitted to a ring-closing metathesis in the presence of catalyst C2. Thus, a bicyclic compound was isolated that was easily converted in its methylated derivative, a precursor of (-)-cermicine C,32 as reported previously33 (Scheme 12).\nScheme 12. Preparation of a precursor of (-)-cermicine C\nThe straightforward synthesis of (-)-pelletierine, shown in Scheme 13, starts from the same material: after introducing the Boc protection at the nitrogen atom, a Wacker-type oxidation followed by deprotection yielded the expected alkaloid.32 On the other hand, (R)-N-Boc-pelletierine has been used for the direct preparation of (+)-allosedrine34 and its (S)-enantiomer for (-)-lausibine II.35\nScheme 13. Synthesis of (-)-pelletierine\nAnother synthetic application of enantiopure 2-allyl-N-tert-butylsulfinylpiperidine is the preparation of tetraponerine T3 as depicted in Scheme 14. After changing the protecting group to Cbz, the oxidative cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond affords the expected aldehyde. This was transformed into its N-tert-butylsulfinyl imine and allylated in situ (iterative process) to yield the corresponding protected homoallyl amine. Its tandem deprotection/hydrogenation and in situ treatment with \u03b3-bromobutanal gave tetraponerine T3 as a single isomer (Scheme 14).36\nScheme 14. Total synthesis of tetraponerine T3\nBy changing the stereochemistry of the tert-butanesulfinamide in the reaction with the aldehyde in Scheme 14, the corresponding 5-epimer (tetraponerine T4) was obtained.36 Following a similar synthetic strategy the other members of the tetraponerine family (T1, T2, T5-T8), components of Pseudomymecine ants (of the genus Tetraponera) secreted against enemies, have been synthesized and studied for their antiproliferative activity.37\n(-)-Aphanorphine, which was isolated from the fresh-water blue-green alga Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, incorporates a 3-benzazepine scaffold that resembles benzomorphane analgesics. The total synthesis of the natural alkaloid starts from the N-tert-butylsulfinyl imine derived from 4-methoxyphenylacetaldehyde, which was reacted with methallyl bromide under standard conditions. Its oxidation afforded the expected epoxide -with concomitant oxidation of the sulfinamide to sulfonamide- that in the presence of KI suffered opening to give the corresponding tertiary alcohol as a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers. The required cyclization of this alcohol under different reaction conditions failed, so it was necessary to change the protection at the nitrogen to the corresponding benzoyl derivative. Treatment of this compound with AlCl3 gave a Friedel-Crafts reaction yielding the corresponding tricycle; further deprotection, methylation at the nitrogen atom and final demethylation at the oxygen atom afforded the expected natural product (Scheme 15).38\nScheme 15. Total synthesis of (-)-aphanorphine\nThe indium-promoted diastereoselective allylation of the corresponding aldehyde allows the preparation of a homoallyl amine, starting material for (-)-tylophorine, used in traditional medicine due to its antiasthmatic, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. After hydroboration and oxidation the expected primary alcohol is obtained, which suffers an intramolecular Mitsunobu reaction to give a N-tert-butylsulfinylpyrrolidine that after deprotection and treatment with formaldehyde yielded the natural alkaloid (Scheme 16).39\nScheme 16. Total synthesis of (-)-tylophorine\nThe same starting material shown in Scheme 16 was used for the synthesis of 7-methoxycryptopleurine, following the reactions depicted in Scheme 17. After exchange of the protecting group to Boc, treatment with formalin in the presence of a Rh catalyst gave a six-membered ring, which after hydrogenation and formylation afforded the expected alkaloid derivative.40\nScheme 17. Total synthesis of 7-methoxycryptopleurine\nOther synthetic methodologies from our research group starting from chiral N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines involving hydrogen transfer, 41 homoallyl amine oxidation,42 addition of organomagnesium,43 organolithium compounds44 or enolates,45 and reaction with nitro compounds46 have been used for the preparation of a series of chiral enantioenriched nitrogen-containing natural and unnatural compounds, including several heterocyclic compounds.\nIn summary, chiral N-tert-butylsulfinyl homoallyl amines were easily prepared with diastereocontrol by allylation of N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines with indium metal under mild reaction conditions. These compounds are useful starting materials for the preparation of chiral natural or unnatural nitrogen-containing compounds, especially biologically active alkaloids. It is worth noting that both enantiomeric starting imines are easily accessible from commercially available compounds. In addition, the final desulfinylation of the obtained products is easily performed with hydrochloric acid in an organic solvent. Finally, the chiral auxiliary can be recycled and reused following reported procedures.47"

            "Over the past decades, ynamides have clearly emerged as versatile and useful building blocks in chemical synthesis.2 The electron-donating character of the nitrogen atom strongly polarizes the carbon - carbon triple bond, which can furnish remarkable levels of reactivity and chemo- and/or stereoselectivities. Although highly reactive, ynamides are also fairly stable thanks to the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen atom which provides increased stability compared to highly sensitive and easily hydrolyzable ynamines. The electron-withdrawing group can also act as a directing group, a chiral auxiliary and even participate in the reaction. As a consequence, tremendous developments have been reported recently and numerous elegant processes have been developed based on the unique chemistry of these nitrogen-substituted alkynes. Overall, ynamides provide with unique opportunities not only for the introduction of nitrogen-containing motifs into organic molecules but also for the generation of otherwise hardly accessible highly reactive intermediates.2c,3 All these developments have been made possible by major breakthroughs for their preparation reported since the beginning of the 21st century. Indeed, efficient and robust methods reported over the past twenty years paved the way for the use of ynamides in chemical synthesis: they will be briefly overviewed in the following paragraphs.\n1. Synthesis of Ynamides: Copper as the General Solution\nAs already discussed in a previous review,4 the first routes for the synthesis of ynamides were mostly based on elimination reactions from halo-enamides, on the isomerization of propargylamines or on the amination of hypervalent iodonium salts. While giving access to some ynamides, these methods were far too limited in terms of substrate scope and relied on rather harsh reaction conditions, which clearly hampered the synthesis and use of ynamides in organic synthesis. Since 2003, this problem has been tackled by the use of copper catalysis, which clearly had a deep impact on the synthesis of ynamides and contributed to unleashing their full potential as versatile buildings blocks in chemical synthesis.5\nIndeed, various processes have been reported for the synthesis of a large variety of ynamides via copper-catalyzed cross couplings between a nitrogen nucleophile and an alkynylating agent, involving formation of the N-C\u2261C bond (Figure 1). Among all alkynylating agents used, one can cite alkynyl bromides6,7 and chlorides8 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes6v,9 and other dihalo-alkenes,8,10 alkynyl(triaryl)bismuthonium salts,11 as well as an alkynylboronate ester.12 Additional routes have also been reported, based on oxidative copper-catalyzed cross couplings, which are quite efficient and usually take place under mild conditions. Alkynylating agents such as terminal alkynes,6t,13 alkynyltrifluoroborates,14 propiolic acids15 and copper acetylides have been used in such processes.16\nIn addition to copper-based processes featuring formation of the N\u2011C\u2261C bond, other strategies have also been reported over the past ten years and enable the synthesis of ynamides with variable levels of efficiency. These include elimination reactions,17 transition-metal-free reactions with hypervalent iodonium18 and (alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium19 salts or functionalization of terminal ynamides,20 mostly through metalation21 and Sonogashira22 or Glaser23 cross couplings. More recently, 1,2-dichloroenamides, readily prepared from trichloroethylene, were shown to be convenient starting materials for the stepwise preparation of a wide variety of ynamides via a sequence involving a base-promoted elimination followed by reaction with an electrophile or an organometallic reagent in the presence of a copper catalyst.24 Finally, some more specific processes have also been reported, including the opening of yne-oxazolidinones to form yne-amides,25 the addition of terminal alkynes to diazodicarboxylates to form yne-hydrazides26 or the peculiar example of a base-promoted opening of an oxazolium salt to form the corresponding yne-amide.27\nFigure 1. Synthesis of ynamides via copper-catalyzed cross couplings\nOverall, ynamides are now readily available building blocks that can be easily and conveniently prepared on a multi-gram scale, some of them being even commercially available.28 Among all methods described over the past 20 years for the preparation of ynamides, copper-based cross couplings have clearly proven to be the most efficient, general and straightforward ones. One can now prepare almost any desired ynamide with specific substitution patterns on a gram-scale using the right combination of alkynylating agent, nitrogen nucleophile, copper source and ligand. To this end, 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes appear to be excellent alkynylating agents as they are stable, cheap, readily available and easily prepared from the corresponding aldehydes using the classical Ramirez olefination29 or Lautens' modification.30 As a consequence, several processes have been reported by us and others since our original report on the use of 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes for the synthesis of ynamides.9a,b In this Organic Syntheses Discussion Addendum, we will first discuss several extensions that have been reported and which focused on extending the scope of the overall transformation. Secondly, representative examples of transformations based on ynamides obtained from the corresponding 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes will be briefly presented to highlight the ever-growing interest of the synthetic community towards their use as building blocks in organic synthesis.\n2. 1,1-Dibromo-1-alkenes as Practical Alkynylating Agents\nIn our original report, we described the synthesis of ynamides by a copper-catalyzed cross coupling between 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes (1.5 equiv) and nitrogen nucleophiles (1 equiv) using copper(I) iodide (12 mol%) and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA, 18 mol%) as a catalytic system with cesium carbonate (4 equiv) as the base. When using aryl-substituted 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes, the reaction is usually performed in 1,4-dioxane (DMF being used in some cases to prevent solubility issues) at 60-70 \u00b0C for 24-48 h. More challenging alkyl-substituted 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes require the use of DMF at 70-90 \u00b0C for 48 h. As for the nitrogen nucleophiles, sulfonamides, oxazolidinones, pyrrolidinones and a methyl carbamate were found to be reactive coupling partners; however, the use of simple secondary amides and ureas, which are reluctant reaction partners in copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, proved unsuccessful (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Original synthesis of ynamides with 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes: reaction conditions and coupling partners\nInterestingly, our group could also highlight the importance of the reaction conditions (i.e., the base, solvent and stoichiometry), which have a dramatic effect on the outcome of the reaction. A fine tuning of these parameters indeed allows to promote a site-selective, double or alkynylative cross coupling between 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes and nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus nucleophiles.9d This furnishes a divergent and straightforward access to diverse hetero-substituted alkynes and alkenes, important building blocks in chemical synthesis. As a note, the synthesis of a bis-ynamide has later been reported using the same catalytic system (CuI and DMEDA)9h whereas a related system based on a stable adduct of CuI and Bu4NI with a DMEDA\u2219MsOH salt ligand was also reported for the cross coupling between (2,2-dibromoethenyl)benzene and 4-phenyloxazolidin-2-one.6v\nSubsequent studies reported by us and others aimed at extending the scope of the cross coupling to another class of nitrogen nucleophiles: N-heterocycles. Several copper-based catalytic systems have indeed been exploited to smoothly promote the direct alkynylation of N-heterocycles such as (benz)imidazoles, indazoles, pyrazoles and imidazoles;9c,d,e,f,g those are illustrated in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Copper-catalyzed alkynylation of N-heterocycles with 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes\n1,1-Dibromo-1-alkenes have also be successfully used for the direct alkynylation of sulfoximines using copper catalysis.9i,j The cross coupling is based on the use of equimolar ratios of 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes and sulfoximines, copper(I) iodide (10 mol%) and 1,10-phenanthroline (20 mol%) as the catalytic system with cesium carbonate as the base in THF at 80 \u00b0C for 3 days. In these conditions, the corresponding N-alkynylsulfoximines were obtained in fair to good yields (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Copper-catalyzed synthesis of N-alkynylsulfoximines with 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes\nMore recently, Anderson described the synthesis of ynediamides from 1,1-dibromoenamides by using copper iodide (20 mol%) and 1,10-phenanthroline (40 mol%) as the catalytic system in the presence of cesium carbonate as the base in THF at 60 \u00b0C. Using these conditions, a series of ynediamides with various substitution patterns could be readily obtained in fair to good yields, even on a gram-scale, although the nature of both electron-withdrawing groups is mainly limited to sulfonamides (Figure 5). The authors also showed that these ynediamides were reactive substrates in various cyclization reactions.9k\nFigure 5. Synthesis of ynediamides\nAdditionally, Perumal reported two copper-catalyzed cross couplings between 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes and nitrogen nucleophiles in which the corresponding ynamides are not isolated but rather directly converted into more complex polycyclic scaffolds by either a silver(I)-assisted intramolecular hydroarylation leading to pyrrolo-/indolo[1,2-a]quinolines and naphtho[2,1-b]thiophenes (Figure 6, Eq. 1)31 or a base-promoted intramolecular hydroamidation leading to 2-aminoindoles and indolo[1,2-a]quinazolines (Figure 6, Eq. 2).32 A related approach was described by Verniest who reported the metal-free cyclization of in situ generated ortho-nitroaryl ynamides from the corresponding 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes and nitrogen nucleophiles, giving access to spiropseudoindoxyls.33\nFigure 6. Synthesis of polycyclic scaffolds from 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes and nitrogen nucleophiles via ynamide intermediates\nAs a final note, other dihalo-alkenes such as 1,2-dibromo-1-styrenes10a and 2-bromo-1-iodoalkenes10b have also been exploited for the synthesis of ynamides using copper catalysis while recent reports also describe the transition-metal-free preparation of ynamides starting from 1,1-dichloro-1-alkenes10c and (Z)-1,2-dichloroalkenes.8 All these alkynylating agents however display a limited substrate scope compared to 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes.\n3. Chemistry of Ynamides: Versatile and Useful Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis\nAs previously mentioned, the development of efficient synthetic procedures for the preparation of ynamides, including those from 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes, paved the way for their use as building blocks in organic chemistry. Indeed, most classes of ynamides are now readily available and can be easily prepared on a multi-gram scale when using the appropriate method. As a consequence, numerous elegant and innovative synthetic transformations have been designed over the past decade to take advantage of the unique reactivity of ynamides. Representative examples of such transformations, for which ynamides have been prepared from the corresponding 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes, will be briefly presented in the following paragraphs.\nYnamides are notably attractive building blocks as they allow the generation of otherwise hardly accessible highly reactive intermediates such as activated keteniminium ions, which can be easily generated upon activation of the starting ynamides under acidic conditions or with an electrophile.2c,34,35 For instance, we reported that ynamides could undergo a smooth hydrofluorination to provide the corresponding \u03b1-fluoroenamides in fair to good yields and with high levels of chemo- and stereoselectivities.36 While our first approach was based on the use of anhydrous HF, we could then extend this procedure to the use of a more user-friendly hydrofluorination agent, HF\u2219pyridine (Figure 7).\nFigure 7. Hydrofluorination of ynamides\nDue to their remarkable electrophilicity, keteniminium ions are also able to promote a [1,5]-hydrogen shift, which can be used to trigger cationic polycyclizations. Simple acids such as stoichiometric triflic acid or catalytic bistriflimide are indeed sufficient to promote novel cationic polycyclization of various ynamides, affording complex nitrogen heterocycles possessing up to three contiguous stereocenters and up to seven fused rings (Figure 8, Eq. 1).37 We also demonstrated that activated keteniminium ions were suitable to initiate a [1,5]-hydride shift from unactivated C-H bonds which led to the development of a new route to highly functionalized tetrahydropyridines and piperidines (Figure 8, Eq. 2).38\nFigure 8. Cationic (poly)cyclization of ynamides through the generation of \u03b1 keteniminium ion intermediate\nBesides the use of strong acids, electrophilic metal complexes have also proven successful to activate ynamides. In particular, gold complexes have been widely used and were shown to promote a variety of different transformations, most of them featuring cyclization of the starting ynamides to produce (poly)cyclic scaffolds. Representative examples of such transformations are the gold-catalyzed formal [3+2]-dipolar cycloaddition between pyridinium N-(heteroaryl)amidines and electron-rich alkynes to afford imidazopyrimidines reported by Davies (Figure 9, Eq. 1),39 the generation of \u03b1-oxocarbenes from ynamides in the presence of pyridine N-oxides as oxidants, followed by a subsequent cyclization, for the synthesis of fused \u03b3-lactams reported by Davies (Figure 9, Eq. 2),40 and other cyclization reactions from N-propargyl ynamides to form bicyclic and tricyclic pyrroles (Figure 9, Eq. 3)41 or from yne-ynamides to afford substituted inden-1-on-3-carboxamides,42 both reported by Hashmi. As an additional note, Alcaide and Almendros reported the metal-free [2+2] cycloaddition of ynamides with Tf2C=CH2 to furnish aminocyclobutenes and aminocyclobutenols.43\nFigure 9. Gold-catalyzed transformations of ynamides for the synthesis of (poly)cyclic scaffolds\nThe metal-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of ynamides is also an attractive strategy that allows the synthesis of highly substituted enamides in a regio- and stereoselective fashion. Representative examples of this strategy are the palladium-catalyzed hydroalkynylation and hydroacyloxylation of ynamides reported by Reddy (Figure 10, Eq. 1)44 and Lam (Figure 10, Eq. 2),45 the nickel-catalyzed hydrophosphonylation of ynamides reported by Rabasso and our group (Figure 10, Eq. 3),46 as well as the copper-catalyzed hydrosilylation of activated alkynes such as ynamides and propiolates reported by Riant and our group (Figure 10, Eq. 4).47 In all four cases, highly substituted enamides are obtained in fair to good yields and with high levels of regio- and stereoselectivities.\nFigure 10. Metal-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of ynamides for the synthesis of highly substituted enamides\nLastly, ynamides can also act as good radical acceptors, although the number of transformations based on this reactivity is still limited. One elegant example has been reported recently by Perez-Luna and describes the radical germylzincation of ynamides which involves the regio- and stereoselective addition of germanium and zinc across the triple bond of diverse hetero-substituted alkynes, using R3GeH and Et2Zn.48 The intermediate vinylzinc species is then trapped by an electrophile to furnish the desired \u03b2-germylenamides via a radical-chain mechanism (Figure 11).\nFigure 11. Radical germylzincation of ynamides\n\n4. Conclusion\nSince the first reports on the synthesis of ynamides using copper catalysis, including our original report on the use of 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes as practical alkynylating agents, the chemistry of these nitrogen-substituted alkynes has experienced an impressive growth. Ynamides are now readily available building blocks that can be easily prepared on a multi-gram scale thanks to various efficient and reliable procedures. These developments had a dramatic impact on the use of ynamides in synthetic chemistry, as illustrated by the representative transformations discussed above. There is no doubt that ynamides will continue to be privileged building blocks as they are particularly attractive, versatile and powerful starting materials in organic synthesis."

            "Nitrogen heterocycles are core structural units of many natural products and drugs.2 Among them, pyrrolines are particularly widespread in natural products and bioactive molecules.3 Since Lu's pioneering discoveries, the phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation of an imine and an allene is now one of the most attractive methods for the construction of a pyrroline.4 Our group5 and Shi's6 have independently developed the phosphine-catalyzed allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation between \u03b3-substituted allenoates with N-sulfonyl imines, broadening the scope of accessible pyrrolidine structures and, thereby, allowing preparation of several natural products and molecules of biological importance (vide infra) (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1 presents a potential mechanism for allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation. The zwitterionic intermediate A, generated from addition of tri-n-butylphosphine to the allenoate 1, adds to the imine 2 to form the phosphonium amide B. Intramolecular addition of the amide anion to the vinylphosphonium brings about the ylide C. Subsequent proton transfer results in the final intermediate D, which dissociates to the 3-pyrroline 3 and tri-n-butylphosphine. In recent years, many new phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] imine-allene annulations, and their synthetic applications, have been reported. These advances are the focus of this Addendum.\nScheme 1. Kwon's synthesis of tetrasubstituted pyrrolines\nIn 2005, Kwon and co-workers found that, in the presence of nucleophilic tri-n-butylphosphine, a variety of \u03b3-substituted allenoates and N-sulfonylimines undergo [3 + 2] annulations to afford functionalized pyrrolines in excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivities (Scheme 1).5 Similar results were disclosed contemporarily by Shi and Zhao who used dimethylphenylphosphine as a catalyst for the [3 + 2] annulation of ethyl penta-2,3-dienoate (Scheme 2).6\nScheme 2. Shi's formation of tetrasubstituted pyrroline derivatives\nIn 2007, He and co-workers demonstrated that the air-stable and readily available 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) is a practical and versatile nucleophilic phosphine catalyst for the [3 + 2] annulations of 4-substituted 2,3-butadienoates with N-tosylarylaldimines, delivering functionalized pyrrolines in good to excellent yields (Scheme 3).7\nScheme 3. He's PTA-catalyzed allene-imine [3 + 2] cycloaddition\nIn addition to N-sulfonylimines, He found that N-thiophosphorylimines (4) readily undergo Lu's [3 + 2] annulation with ethyl allenoate or \u03b3-substituted allenoates in the presence of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) or PTA, affording the corresponding N-(thio)phosphoryl 3-pyrrolines 5 in moderate to high yields and with good diastereoselectivities (Scheme 4).8 Ready deprotection of the thiophosphoryl group was achieved in MeOH under acidic conditions.\nScheme 4. He's [3 + 2] annulations of allenes with N-thiophosphorylimines\nIn 2017, Wu and co-workers reported a phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation of N-aryl fluorinated imines with allenoates.9 Using 20 mol % of PCy3 as the catalyst in toluene at 60 \u00b0C, they prepared a series of fluorinated pyrrolines (6) in moderate yields (Scheme 5). They converted these product 3-pyrrolines to the fluorinated pyrroles 7 through dehydroaromatizations in the presence of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) in high to excellent yields.\nScheme 5. Wu's phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulations of N-aryl fluorinated imines with allenoates\nIn 2012, Ye and co-workers described the use of cyclic imines for phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulations with ethyl allenoate to prepare functionalized sultam-fused pyrrolines (8) in moderate to good yields and with high regioselectivities (Scheme 6).10\nScheme 6. Ye's preparation of functionalized pyrrolines\nFollowing Ye's success at using cyclic imines to generate a class of functionalized dihydropyrroles, Guo11 and Wang12 independently disclosed the application of sulfamate-derived cyclic imines as [3 + 2] annulation partners (Scheme 7). In the presence of a catalytic amount of PPh3, their reactions afforded various functionalized cyclic sulfamidates (9), with a number of substitution patterns, in excellent yields.\nScheme 7. Guo's and Wang's synthesis of functionalized cyclic sulfamidates\nSubsequently, Ma and co-workers disclosed highly efficient 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP)-catalyzed one-pot sequential [3 + 2]/[3 + 2] annulations of an allenoate with cyclic quinazolin-5-ones to provide N-fused polycyclic compounds (11, Scheme 8).13 The product of the first [3 + 2] annulation is an electron-deficient alkene, which prompts the second allene-alkene [3 + 2] annulation. This reaction is exceptionally regio- and diastereoselective.\nScheme 8. Ma's synthesis of functionalized polycyclic compounds\nWith further optimization, Ma and co-workers demonstrated the selective [3 + 2] annulations of cyclic quinazolin-5-ones (Scheme 9).14 Unlike the dual processes described in their previous report, here, in the presence of catalytic PPh3, only the allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation occurred, smoothly furnishing tricyclic dihydropyrrole derivatives in excellent yields.\nScheme 9. Ma's synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrroloquinazolin-5-ones\nIn 2011, Loh reported an elegant and highly efficient route toward functionalized 2-alkyl-substituted pyrrolines from N-sulfonyl alkylimines.15 N-Sulfonyl alkylimines can be difficult to handle because they readily decompose through hydrolysis, hampering their applicability in many phosphine-catalyzed reactions. In the presence of trimethylphosphine, Loh demonstrated that the in situ isomerization of 3-butynoates to 2,3-butadienoates and subsequent incorporation of N-sulfonyl alkylimines through [3 + 2] annulations afforded functionalized pyrrolines in good yields (Scheme 10).\nScheme 10. Loh's synthesis of functionalized 2-alkylpyrrolines\nApplying this newly developed method for generating 2- alkyl\u2212substituted pyrrolines, Loh completed a formal synthesis of (\u00b1)-allosecurinine featuring a step involving the formation of the 2,5-dialkylpyrroline 12 in 82% yield (Scheme 11). Eight subsequent steps furnished the known intermediate 13 in excellent yield. Kerr and co-workers had previous reported the total synthesis of (\u00b1)-allosecurinine 14 from the intermediate 13.16\nScheme 11. Loh's formal synthesis of (\u00b1)-allosecurinine\nIn 2011, Kinderman and co-workers reported the use of rare 2,3-dienenitriles 15 in Lu's allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation, in place of the commonly employed 2,3-dienoates (Scheme 12).17 They prepared several pyrroline derivatives bearing a cyano group from these rare allenenitriles. Analogous to the reactivities of allenoates, the transformations of the 2,3-butadienenitriles were also catalyzed by PPh3, providing cyano-substituted pyrrolines (16) in good yields.\nScheme 12. Kinderman's preparation of cyanopyrrolines\n\nEnantioselective Allene-Imine [3 + 2] Annulations Using Monofunctional Chiral Phosphines\nPrior to the 2008 report by Jacobsen (vide infra), enantioselective allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations had been challenging when compared with their corresponding allene-alkene [3 + 2] annulations, with relatively few examples producing synthetically useful levels of enantioselectivity [i.e., enantiomeric excesses (ee's) of greater than 90%]. In 2006, Gladysz employed the chiral rhenium-based phosphine P1 to catalyze Lu's [3 + 2] annulations of ethyl 2,3-butadienoate with N-tosyl imines (Scheme 13).18 Using this catalyst, the desired pyrrolines were isolated in high yields and with moderate enantioselectivities.\nScheme 13. Gladysz's asymmetric [3 + 2] annulations using a rhenium-containing phosphine catalyst\nMarinetti was among the forerunners in the area of chiral pyrroline construction, reporting numerous studies of various chiral phosphine catalysts and their abilities to render asymmetric induction.19 Among the many readily available chiral phosphines with axial and planar chirality that they tested, several induced the enantioselective formation of pyrrolines, albeit with low yields and moderate selectivities (Scheme 14). The chiral phosphines in Scheme 14 produced low to moderate yields of pyrrolines with minimal asymmetric induction. Preliminary screening revealed that several phosphine catalysts produced moderate levels of chiral induction, but the low product yields of these reactions suggested little synthetic utility.\nScheme 14. Marinetti's screening of chiral phosphines for [3 + 2] annulations giving pyrrolines\nAfter an extensive search for the ideal catalyst for enantioselective formation of pyrrolines, Marinetti found that Gladiali's phosphepine P6 functioned with moderate enantiocontrol (Scheme 15).20,21,22 They synthesized pyrrolines in moderate yields from substrates presenting various activating groups with a range of steric influence, albeit with moderate enantioselectivities.\nScheme 15. Marinetti's asymmetric [3 + 2] annulations forming pyrrolines\nThere exists only a single report of highly efficient asymmetric allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations using chiral phosphines that lack hydrogen-bonding motifs. In 2014, Kwon and co-workers developed two new pseudoenantiomeric [2.2.1] bicyclic phosphines-endo-phenyl-HypPhos (P7) and exo-phenyl-HypPhos (P8)-from naturally occurring trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Hyp), each in five steps. Both bridged bicyclic P-chiral phosphines are efficient at promoting [3 + 2] annulations of \u03b3-substituted allenoates with activated imines, providing various chiral functionalized dihydropyrroles in excellent yields and with high ee's (Scheme 16).23 This methodology has been applied in the synthesis of 1,2,3,5-substituted pyrroline derivatives, providing a geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) inhibitor that is viable for in vivo anticancer treatment.24 Both of the HypPhos ligands P7 and P8, along with eight other analogues, are at present available from Sigma-Aldrich.\nScheme 16. Kwon's synthesis of enantioenriched dihydropyrroles\nAlthough endo- and exo-phenyl-HypPhos behaved as pseudo-enantiomers to form 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted pyrrolines in opposite enantiomeric forms, they both provided the (S)-1,2,3-trisubstituted pyrrolines when employing simple allenoates lacking a g-substituent. In particular, endo-phenyl-HypPhos provided the (S)-1,2,3-trisubstituted pyrrolines with higher ee's. To create chiral phosphines with the P-stereogenic 2-phosphabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane scaffold, very recently (in 2018) we adopted the natural terpenoid carvone as the starting materials. Hydrodealkenylation25 of the isopropenyl substituent of carvone allowed generation of both the exo- and endo-phenyl-CarvoPhos ligands P9 and P10.26 These novel P-stereogenic chiral phosphines P9 and P10 were applied to enantioselective [3 + 2] annulations of allenoates and imines to obtain a series of 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted pyrrolines in excellent yields and with high ee's (Scheme 17). In particular, a biologically active small molecule, (R)-efsevin, was prepared in 93% yield and 84% ee.\nScheme 17. Kwon's synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolines\nIn 2012, the Kwon group highlighted the synthetic utility of the HypPhos-catalyzed allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation in the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-ibophyllidine.27 This achievement also marked the first nonformal total synthesis of a complex natural product employing a phosphine-catalyzed allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation. From the N-Boc-indole-3-imine 17, the key transformation-the asymmetric [3 + 2] annulation-was catalyzed by endo-phenyl-HypPhos (P7). The reaction afforded the pyrroline 18 in 93% yield and 99% ee (Scheme 18). When run on an approximately 30 g scale, the annulation proceeded in 94% yield and 97% ee. This powerful phosphine-catalyzed asymmetric [3 + 2] annulation set two of the stereocenters in ibophyllidine with excellent efficiency. The total synthesis of (+)-ibophyllidine 19 was completed in 13 steps from the enantiopure pyrroline 18.\nScheme 18. Kwon's enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-ibophyllidine\nIn 2016, Kwon et al. described another HypPhos-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation of benzyl allenoate with an N-(o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl) ( o-nosyl) imine to construct the pyrroline intermediate 20 in the total synthesis of the biologically active natural product (-)-actinophyllic acid hydrochloride (21, Scheme 19).28 The combination of endo-p-anisyl-HypPhos (P12) and (S)-BINOL facilitated the transformation to the cycloadduct in 99% yield and with 94% ee. Notably, the use of (R)-BINOL as an additive provided the same enantioselectivity as that of (S)-BINOL.\nScheme 19. Kwon's total synthesis of (-)-actinophyllic acid\n\nEnantioselective allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations using multifunctional chiral phosphines\nEarly efforts toward the synthesis of enantiopure dihydropyrroles through the [3 + 2] annulations of allenoates with imines met with limited success. In 2008, Jacobsen and co-workers introduced the bifunctional thiourea phosphine catalyst P13 for the asymmetric [3 + 2] annulation of allenoates with diphenylphosphinoylimines (22).29 This protocol furnished a broad range of substituted dihydropyrroles (23) in excellent yield with very high enantioselectivities (Scheme 20). The addition of both water and triethylamine increased the rate of the reaction and suppressed undesired byproducts. The effect of adding water-increasing the reaction efficiency by facilitating proton transfer during the annulation-has been studied computationally.30\nScheme 20. Jacobsen's asymmetric synthesis of pyrrolines\nLu reported, in 2012, an elegant process for asymmetric induction using the amino acid-derived chiral phosphine P14.31 Reminiscent of Jacobsen's approach, they used sterically demanding diphenylphosphinoyl imines to achieve high enantiocontrol (Scheme 21). In addition to alkyl imines, aryl imines also afforded their functionalized pyrrolines with great efficiencies and ee's. Using Jacobsen's and Lu's systems, both enantiomers of 2-pyrrolines can be accessed for synthetic applications.\nScheme 21. Lu's enantioselective synthesis of 2-alkyl- and 2-aryl- substituted pyrroline 3-carboxylates\nIn the same article, Lu and co-workers described the formal synthesis of the alkaloid natural product (+)-trachelanthamidine (26), with allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation as a key step, using the chiral phosphine catalyst P14 (Scheme 22). Several subsequent functional group manipulations were performed to remove the phosphoryl and silyl protecting groups. Sulfonylation of the free pyrroline amino group with p-tolylsulfonyl chloride rendered a formal synthesis of the target 25 toward (+)-trachelanthamidine (26). This short formal synthesis confirmed the applicability of this key [3 + 2] annulation in natural products synthesis.\nScheme 22. Lu's formal synthesis of (+)-trachelanthamidine\nIn 2013, the Guo group demonstrated the formation of functionalized tricyclic sulfamidates through reactions catalyzed by the l-isoleucine-derived bifunctional N-acylaminophosphine P1532 (Scheme 23). The transformations proceeded to give chiral sulfamate-fused dihydropyrroles in good yields and with moderate to excellent ee's.\nScheme 23. Guo's asymmetric synthesis of functionalized tricyclic sulfamidates\nIn 2014, Toffano and Vo-Thanh reported the synthesis of a chiral thiourea-phosphine organocatalyst derived from l-proline.33 The resulting annulation, however, yielded the dihydropyrrole in low ee when using the catalyst P16 (Scheme 24).\nScheme 24. Toffano and Vo-Thanh's use of a thiourea-phosphine organocatalyst in an asymmetric allene-imine [3 + 2] annulation\nIn 2016, the Lu group investigated the bifunctional chiral phosphine P17 as a catalyst for enantioselective [3 + 2] annulations of isatin-derived ketimines with both simple and \u03b3-substituted allenoates (Scheme 25).34 In the presence of a catalytic amount of the bifunctional chiral phosphine P17, unique 3,2\u00b4-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles were synthesized in a highly enantioselective manner and in good yields.\nScheme 25. Lu\u2018s enantioselective phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloadditions of allenoates with isatin-derived ketimines\nKumar and co-workers performed similar transformations using Zhao's N-acylaminophosphine P15 as the catalyst for the synthesis of 3,2\u00b4-dihydropyrrolyl spirooxindoles with high efficacies and with excellent enantioselectivities (Scheme 26).35\nScheme 26. Kumar's use of Zhao's chiral phosphine catalyst in allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations\nVery recently, Kitagaki and co-workers demonstrated that the planar-chiral [2.2]paracyclophane-based phosphine-phenol catalyst P18, which features a benzene ring spacer between the pseudo-ortho-substituted [2.2]paracyclophanol skeleton and the diarylphosphino group, is highly efficient at mediating enantioselective [3 + 2] annulations of allenoates and N-tosylimines (Scheme 27).36 This catalyst offered enantioselectivities as high as 92%-the highest reported to date for phosphine-catalyzed annulations of unsubstituted allenic esters with N-tosylaldimines.\nScheme 27. Kitagaki's planar-chiral [2.2]paracyclophane-based phosphine-phenol catalyst for allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations\nIn summary, phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulations of allenes and imines can be efficient protocols for regio- and stereoselective syntheses, under mild conditions, of valuable substituted pyrrolines presenting a variety of functional groups. Such methods are intriguing because the seemingly innocuous phosphine acts, in most cases, as the catalyst with no need for additional ligands or additives. The broad substrate scope of phosphine-catalyzed allene-imine [3 + 2] annulations has been exploited in the total syntheses of important bioactive alkaloid natural products and medicinally relevant compounds. Such [3 + 2] annulations should find broader applications in the syntheses of other natural products, bioactive molecules, and functional materials."

            "It is believed that more than 75% of all drugs and drug candidates contain the amine functionality.2 In many cases, especially natural products, aminated compounds possess at least one stereogenic center, so asymmetric methodologies that provide chiral amines enantioselectively are of great synthetic importance. For chiral \u03b1 -substituted amines, the most useful procedure involves the reduction of chiral ketimines or the addition of organometallic reagents to chiral aldimines.3 Among different possible starting imines, those possessing a sulfinyl moiety attached to the nitrogen atom are of especial interest because this group plays two important roles: (a) activation of the C=N group in the reaction with nucleophiles, and (b) introduction of asymmetric information, which makes it possible to perform asymmetric reactions. Two families of chiral sulfinyl imines have been reported in the literature, one containing a p-tolyl group4 and the other a tert-butyl group5 attached to the sulfinyl moiety, the latter being more efficient concerning diastereoselectivity.6 The asymmetric reduction of sulfinyl ketimines has been performed using boranes,3c,7,8 sodium or lithium borohydrides,3,7,9 or diethylzinc in the presence of nickel acetylacetate.10 Some years ago11 we found that the transfer hydrogenation12,13 is a very useful reduction protocol because, on one hand, it avoids the use of dangerous molecular hydrogen and, on the other hand, it uses an inexpensive and easy-to-handle hydrogen source such as isopropanol or formic acid derivatives.14\nThe starting enantiomerically pure N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines15 are easily prepared by mixing the corresponding carbonyl compounds with enantiomerically pure commercially available tert-butanesulfinamides in the presence of a Lewis acid, titanium tetraethoxide being the most commonly used, under thermal16 or microwave17 activation. Other procedures involving epoxides18 or allylic alcohols and aryl iodides19 are complementary but are not as general.\nRuthenium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines12\nDue to the versatility of \u03b1-amino alcohols as ligands for asymmetric catalysis in transfer hydrogenation to ketones,20 and after screening different compounds,11 the corresponding indanol derivative was found to be the most effective.21 The match combination is shown in Scheme 1, where use of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 as catalyst provided the expected N-sulfinyl amines, which were deprotected in situ with hydrochloric acid in methanol to afford the corresponding chiral primary amines with enantioselectivities up to >99% ee (Figure 1).11,22\nScheme 1. Preparation of enantioenriched primary amines by transfer hydrogenation of N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines\nFigure 1. Enantioenriched primary amines prepared according to Scheme 1\nUsing the starting imine and the amino alcohol with opposite configuration, two representative ent-amines were prepared (Figure 2).22\nFigure 2. ent-Primary amines prepared\nAn interesting simplification of the procedure shown in Scheme 1 has been the use of an achiral amino alcohol as ligand for the same ruthenium catalyst. After screening several commercially available compounds, 2-amino-1,1-dimethylethanol was determined to be the most efficient both in terms of yield and enantioselectivity for the obtained amines (Scheme 2).23\nScheme 2. Preparation of enantioenriched primary amines using an achiral amino alcohol\nFrom the reaction depicted in Scheme 2 it is remarkable that the mentioned improvement gives excellent enantioselectivities for aliphatic amines (Figure 3)24, comparable to the procedure shown in Scheme 1. A mechanistic proposal based on both experimental results and DFT calculations indicates that the reaction pathway involves two transition states and three intermediates, with the reaction being a stepwise process and not a concerted one.24\nFigure 3. Enantioenriched primary amines prepared according to Scheme 2\nWhen starting materials with the opposite configuration were used, the corresponding enantiomeric primary amines were isolated (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Enantiomeric primary amines from ent-imines\nA further improvement of the procedure depicted in Scheme 2 was the use of microwaves (40 W) instead of heating: yields and enantioselectivities are similar to those given in Figures 3 and 4, but reaction times are significantly reduced (from 1-4 hours to less than 30 minutes).25\nSynthetic applications of the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation to N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines\nWhen the starting imine bears an ester group at one of the \u03c9-positions the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation gives a chiral amino ester that after deprotection spontaneously cyclizes to provide enantioenriched substituted lactams.26 The starting enantiopure imino esters were prepared from the corresponding keto esters following literature procedures16,17 in 59-85% yields. After performing the transfer hydrogenation, deprotection with hydrochloric acid in methanol gives direct access to the expected enantioenriched lactams (Scheme 3): in this case both series of enantiomers were prepared (Figure 5).26\nScheme 3. Preparation of enantioenriched lactams from imino esters\nFigure 5. Enantioenriched lactams prepared\nThe use of \u03c9-chloro imines allows the preparation of N-sulfinyl nitrogen-containing saturated heterocycles.27 In this case, it was not possible to prepare the corresponding imine with n = 1 because a \u03b2 -elimination occurred in the starting chloro imine under the reaction conditions used for the synthesis of the imine. For n = 0 and for n = 2-4 the expected chloro imines were isolated16,17 with yields ranging from 64 to 92%. Reaction conditions for the second step of the process (cyclization) depend on the size of the ring formed: whereas for aziridines and pyrrolidines, the basic reaction medium is sufficient to provoke the cyclization (Scheme 4 and Figure 6), for the 6- and 7-membered heterocycles an additional treatment with KHMDS was necessary to promote the desired cyclization (Scheme 5). In the latter case, the cyclization reaction failed, which made it necessary to start from the corresponding bromo derivative in order to obtain the expected azepine. In all cases the corresponding N-sulfinylated products were isolated (hydrolysis was performed with NH4Cl instead of HCl) in order to facilitate their isolation and purification. Desulfinylation can be easily carried out with HCl in methanol to give the expected free amines: Figure 7 shows two examples of enantiomeric pyrrolidines.\nScheme 4. Preparation of enantioenriched protected aziridines and pyrrolidines\nFigure 6. Enantioenriched protected aziridines and pyrrolidines prepared\nFigure 7. Two examples of enantiomeric deprotected pyrrolidines\nScheme 5. Preparation of protected enantioenriched piperidines and azepines\nThe same reaction conditions have been applied to \u03b1, \u03b2 -unsaturated N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines in order to prepare enantioenriched allylic amines.28 Once the transfer hydrogenation took place, the corresponding desulfinylation under standard conditions afforded a series of enantioenriched primary allylic amines with high enantioselectivity (Scheme 6 and Figure 8).\nScheme 6. Preparation of enantioenriched primary allylic amines\nFigure 8. Enantioenriched allylic amines prepared\nOther synthetic methodologies from our research group starting from N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines involve In-promoted allylation,15 homoallylic oxidation,29 addition of organomagnesium,30 organolithium compounds31 or enolates,32 and reaction with nitrocompounds.33 These methods are useful in the synthesis of enantioenriched natural and unnatural nitrogen-containing compounds, including heterocyclic derivatives.\nIn summary, transfer hydrogenation to chiral imines, followed by desulfinylation under acidic conditions, is a versatile and useful methodology for the preparation of a wide range of enantioenriched primary \u03b1,\u03b1 -disubstituted amines. In addition, the chiral auxiliary can be recycled by application of simple reported procedures.34"

The solution of crude (1R,2R)-N,N'-bis(2-hydroxy-phenylmethylene)-1,2-bis(2-methylphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (1) (1.7 g, ~3.3 mmol) in THF (50 mL) (Note 6) is added into the flask by syringe through the rubber septum, and then a 12 M HCl solution (1.5 mL) (Note 7) is added into the stirred reaction mixture by syringe over 1 min at 20 \u00b0C (Figure 2A). After the solution is stirred for 4 h (Figure 2B), Et2O (50 mL) is added to the reaction mixture, and then the diamine product is extracted with a 1 M HCl solution (10 mL \u00d7 3). The combined aqueous phase is washed with Et2O (10 mL), and then it is basified with a 2 M NaOH solution (40 mL). The resulting yellow suspension is extracted with Et2O (20 mL \u00d7 3). The combined organic layer is washed with water (30 mL) and a saturated aqueous solution of NaCl (30 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (3 g), and filtered through filter paper. The volatiles are removed by rotary evaporation (30 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) and under vacuum (1.0 mmHg) to give (1R,2R)-1,2-bis(2-methylphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (718 mg, 73% (2 steps)) as light brown powder (Notes 8, 9, and 10) .\nFigure 2.

Lithium aluminum hydride (460 mg, 12 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 17) is added through the open neck under a positive pressure of nitrogen. The open neck is capped by a rubber septum, and the flask is cooled by an ice/water bath. Anhydrous THF (10 mL) (Note 6) is added by syringe through the rubber septum, and the gray suspension is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 5 min. A solution of (1R, 2R)-N,N'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,2-bis(2-methylphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane (3) (900 mg, 2.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in THF (10 mL) is added dropwise by syringe through the rubber septum over 5 min (Figure 4A).

Water (1 mL) is added dropwise by syringe through the septum over 10 min (Note 18), and then an aqueous solution of NaOH (3 M; 1 mL) is added in one portion. The resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 1 h until the color of the precipitate changes from gray to white (Figure 4B). The warm solution is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel that contains a bed of celite (1.0 cm height), and the precipitate is washed with Et2O (50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) and under vacuum (1 mmHg). The residue is dissolved in hexanes (50-mL) and the solution is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel with filter paper. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) and then under vacuum (1 mmHg), which yields the desired diamine ligand 4 as an off-white solid (558 mg, 88% yield, >99% ee) (Notes 19, 20 and 21).\nFigure 4.

Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (10.00 g, 54.3 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) is added, followed by trifluoroacetic acid (40.0 mL)(Note 3), which forms a white suspension (Figure 1A). A 35%w/w aqueous solution of H2O2 (4.67 mL, 54.3 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added dropwise by syringe pump to the white suspension over 2 h. Caution: the reaction is highly exothermic (Notes 4, 5 and 6). After the addition is completed, a clear solution is formed and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 10 min, after which starting material is no longer detectable (Figure 1B) (Note 7).\nThe reaction mixture is poured into an Erlenmeyer flask containing chilled water (350 mL) and the suspension thus obtained is filtered through a sintered glass frit (10 \u03bcM pore size) and washed with ice-cold water (2 x 60 mL). The solid obtained is dried on the frit under passage of air for 2 h and then recrystallized from toluene (400 mL) (Notes 8 and 9) to afford pure 1 as white needles (9.03 g, 81% yield, 97 wt% purity) (Notes 10 and 11).2\nFigure 1.

A 250 mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with nitrogen inlet (connected to Schlenk line and bubbler), rubber septum and thermocouple, containing a 1.5 cm teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, is placed under N2. The flask is charged with TMS-acetylene (4.58 mL, 33.0 mmol, 1.08 equiv) (Note 12) and dry THF (50 mL) (Note 13). The resulting clear solution is cooled in an isopropanol-dry ice bath (internal temperature -70 \u00b0C) and n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane; 13.2 mL, 33.0 mmol, 1.08 equiv) is added dropwise at a rate that keeps the internal temperature below -60 \u00baC (Note 14). Ten minutes after the addition is finished, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to 0 \u00b0C. Once this temperature is reached, the reaction flask is again cooled with an isopropanol-dry ice bath to an internal temperature of -60 \u00b0C and TIPSCl (6.55 mL, 30.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added over 5 min (Note 15). After the addition has completed, the clear solution is allowed to slowly warm up to room temperature over 16 h (Figure 2A).\nAfter this time, the reaction mixture is poured in a 500 mL separatory funnel, which already contains a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (150 mL). Addition of MTBE (50 mL) causes the formation of a biphasic mixture and the phases are separated (Figure 2B). The aqueous phase is extracted twice in the same manner (MTBE, 2 x 100 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (1 x 100 mL). The resulting colorless organic phase is dried over MgSO4 (10 g) and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure (40 \u00b0C, 375 to 75 mmHg) to afford the product as a colorless oil (7.42 g, 95% yield, 99 wt% purity) (Notes 16 and 17).3\nFigure 2.

Subsequently, the flask is charged with dibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5-oxide 1 (5.0 g, 25.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and dry DCM (150 mL) (Note 18), and the clear solution is cooled to -50 \u00b0C (internal temperature) using a cryocooler (Figure 3A). Triflic anhydride (4.20 mL, 25.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is slowly added over 5 min by syringe pump, causing an intense orange/red suspension to form (Figure 3B) (Note 19). The reaction mixture is stirred for 45 min at this temperature. After this time a solution of alkyne 2 (7.90 mL, 25.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry DCM (10 mL) is added to the reaction mixture over 5 min by syringe pump. No immediate change in the appearance of the suspension is observed. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to -15 \u00b0C over one hour during which time the orange-red suspension slowly becomes a clear light brown solution that is stirred at this temperature under N2 for another 12 h (Figure 3C).\nThe reaction mixture is quenched by addition of methanol (5 mL) and the resulting light brown solution is transferred to a 500 mL single-necked, round bottomed flask. Silica gel (50 mL) is added and the resulting slurry is concentrated to dryness, adsorbing the crude product onto silica gel (Note 20). This silica gel is dry-loaded onto a packed column prepared from a slurry of silica gel in CH2Cl2 (95 g silica gel, 16.0 x 6.0 cm) and is covered with a layer of sand. The column is eluted first with DCM (500 mL) and later with a DCM:acetone mixture, 4:1 (2 L) (Notes 7, 21 and 22). The product-containing fractions are combined and the solvent partially evaporated (40\u00b0C, 600 to 375 mmHg) to leave approximately 15 mL of the colorless-to-pale-yellow solution eluent. Slow addition of Et2O (100 mL) (Note 23) over 5 min causes the precipitation of 3 as a white microcrystalline powder (Figure 4). The resulting solution is cooled to 0 \u00baC in an ice bath, and the solid is filtered and washed with Et2O (50 mL) to afford pure 3 (7.50 g, 58% yield, 98 wt% purity) (Notes 24, 25, and 26).\nFigure 3.

            "Allylic oxidation of alkenes, which converts an allylic methylene group to a carbonyl group,2 is powerful methodology for the synthesis of unsaturated ketones.3 Compared with more traditional oxidative reagents, such as stoichiometric oxidants selenium dioxide4 and chromium(VI), 5 the mild tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) oxidant, when combined with select transition metals, has advantages, 6 especially in large-scale reactions and natural product syntheses. Doyle and coworkers have developed an efficient and selective oxidative system using dirhodium(II) caprolactamate Rh2(cap)4 as the catalyst and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the terminal oxidant.7 Since this protocol was first reported for the allylic oxidation of cyclic alkenes, a variety of oxidative transformations, including benzylic oxidations,8 propargylic oxidations,9 oxidative reactions with phenols and aniline,10 imine formation from secondary amines,11 and oxidative Mannich reactions of N,N-dialkylanilines, have also been shown to be efficient.12\nThe success of TBHP as a selective oxidant is due to formation of the tert-butylperoxy radical (Scheme 1).13 Although the initial reaction with the transition metal is O-O cleavage, the initially formed and more reactive tert-butoxy radical preferentially abstracts a hydrogen atom from TBHP at a near diffusion-controlled rate. The oxidized transition metal compound then undergoes reductive elimination with the formation of water and the tert-butylperoxy radical. In these reactions dirhodium caprolactamate appears to have an advantage over other transition metal complexes because of its low oxidation potential and high turnover rates.14 A competing reaction for the tert-butylperoxy radical is dimerization that results in the production of dioxygen and di-tert-butyl peroxide.\nScheme 1. Catalytic production of the tert-butylperoxy radical\nAt the time of our 2012 Org. Synth. report, allylic oxidations catalyzed by Rh2(cap)4 and TBHP focused on cyclic alkenes, including unsaturated steroids, and on electron-deficient acyclic alkenes. The applications of this powerful catalytic oxidative method to other substrates bearing allylic C-H bonds, especially in the total synthesis of natural products, are summarized in this Discussion Addendum.\nN-Substituted 2,3-dihydro-4-piperidones and substituted 4-pyranone compounds are important intermediates in natural products and drug candidates.15 Allylic oxidations of cyclic enamides and enol ethers provide substituted piperidones and pyranones by Rh2(cap)4-catalyzed oxidations using TBHP with NaOAc as the additive (Scheme 2).16 Initial hydrogen atom abstraction produces a heteroatom-stabilized allylic radical, with ketone formation at the 4-position when R= aryl or alkyl and at the 2-position when R = H. Oxidation occurs under mild conditions with very low catalyst loading.\nScheme 2. Catalytic oxidation of cyclic enamides and enol ethers\nAlthough many allylic oxidation methods have been reported, it is challenging to find the optimal methodology that provides the necessary chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity for the synthesis of multifunctional natural products.3b The Rh2(cap)4-catalyzed TBHP allylic oxidation was employed for the synthesis of dehydroaltenuene B, which had been isolated from cultures of an unidentified freshwater aquatic fungal species from the Tubeufiaceae family.17 In the first total synthesis of dehydroaltenuene B by the Barrett group,18 the authors found that \u03b1, \u03b2 -unsaturated ketone 8, which was the key intermediate, could be obtained by TBHP allylic oxidation of fused cyclic alkene 7 in good yield (Scheme 3).\nScheme 3. Preparation of 8 in the total synthesis of dehydroaltenuene B\nIn the synthesis of antifungal glucan synthase inhibitors from enfumafungin, the allylic oxidation of amide 10 to enone 11 is one of the key steps.19 The method first reported by Merck Research Laboratories and Scynexis Inc., required 45 equivalents of CrO3 and 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (3,5-DMP) (Table 1, entry 1).20 The yield of enone 11 decreased to 36% when CrO3 and 3,5-DMP were reduced to 15 equivalents (Table 1, entry 2). Further optimization of this step with catalytic metal catalyst and TBHP or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) demonstrated that the oxidation of 10 catalyzed by Rh2(cap)4 afforded enone 11 and tert-butylperoxy ether 12 (1.3 : 1), with a 30% isolated yield of enone 11. The oxidation of amide 10 under Corey-Yu conditions21 gave a similar result, which could be further optimized with a bulkier oxidant CHP (Table 1, entries 4-5).\nTable 1.

Substrates with side-chain electron withdrawing groups undergo direct allylic oxidation without migration of the double bond (Table 2, entries 1 and 2); however, formation of the more stable allylic radical produced transposed enones as the main or exclusive product when other cyclic alkenes were investigated (Table 2, entries 3-11).\nScheme 4. Synthesis of enone 14 as the intermediate of \u039412-PGJ3\nTable 2. Regioselective allylic oxidation of substituted cycloalkenes by (A) Rh2(cap)4 (0.5 mol%) and tBuOOH (5.0 equiv) or (B) Mn(OAc)3 (20 mol%)) and tBuOOH (4.0 equiv)\nTu and coworkers developed an efficient synthesis route for the construction of the core structure of calyciphylline A type alkaloids 38 in which the precursor of key rearrangement step was synthesized by Rh2(cap)4-catalyzed allylic oxidation of a substituted cyclohexene (Scheme 5).24 This transformation shows good tolerance of functional groups for this oxidative method.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of the rearrangement precursor 37\nIn the asymmetric total synthesis of longeracinphyllin A 41, Li and coworkers found that the allylic oxidation of enone 39, promoted by DABCO and air, furnished enedione 40 in 91% yield, presumably through enolate peroxidation and hydroxyl elimination (Scheme 6).25 The author also reported that Rh2(cap)4-catalyzed TBHP oxidation could also achieve this transformation, but yield of the reaction was moderate.\nScheme 6. Allylic oxidation of enone 39 to enedione 40\nThe Sarpong group reported the synthesis of a range of phomactin congeners via a common intermediate.26 The allylic oxidation of phomactin P provided phomactin K in 52% yield (Scheme 7). Amazingly, in this process the exocyclic double bond and epoxide functional groups of phomactin P survive.\nScheme 7. Allylic oxidation of phomactin P to phomactin K\n7\u03b1-Hydroxy-cholest-4-en-3-one has been reported as a biomarker for bile acid loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and other associated disorders and diseases. A key feature of the synthesis of this compound reported by the Yoshimoto group27 involved two allylic oxidative reactions, the C-7 allylic oxidation of 44 to give 45 and the C-3 allylic oxidation of 46 to give 47 (Tables 3 and 4). In the C-3 allylic oxidation, use of Rh2(cap)4 as the catalyst with TBHP was competitive with those with CrO3 or PCC oxidants (entries 1-2) or oxidations by TBHP catalyzed by other transition metal compounds (entries 3 and 6). However, Co(OAc)2 and CuI were superior to Rh2(cap)4 as catalysts for the allylic oxidation of enone 47 (Table 4).\nTable 3: Summary of C7-oxidation conditionsa\nEntry\nTime\nMetal\nSolvent\nIsolated yield of 45\n1\n12 h\nCrO3/3,5-DMP\nDCM\n79%\n2\n36 h\nPCC\nToluene\n27%\n3\n20 h\nCo(OAc)2\nCH3CN\n68%\n4\n24 h\nRh2(cap)4\nDCE\n71%\n5\n12 h\nRh2(cap)4\nDCE\n45%\n6\n20 h\nCuI\nCH3CN\n53%\na For entries 2-6: the metal was added to the solution of the starting material (44, 300 mg, 0.7 mmol) in indicated solvent (5-6 mL) in a 50 mL screw cap vial fitted with a rubber stopper.

Entries 3-6:the reaction temperature was 40\u00b0C, 1.5 mL (70% in water, v/v) of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (11 mmol, 15 equiv) was used.\nTable 4: Summary of C3-oxidation conditionsa\nEntry\nTime\nMetal\nSolvent\nIsolated yield of 47\n1\n12 h\nCrO3/3,5-DMP\nDCM\n56%\n2\n20 h\nCo(OAc)2\nDCM\n60%\n3\n24 h\nRh2(cap)4\nDCE\n33%\n4\n12 h\nRh2(cap)4\nDCE\n37%\n5\n20 h\nCuI\nDCM\n58%\nFor entries 2-5: tert-butyl hydroperoxide was used (0.15 mL, 1.1 mmol), reaction temperature was 40 \u00b0C, 5 mL of solvent was used. Entry 2: 105 mg of starting material (0.25 mmol), 10 mg of Co(OAc)2 (0.04 mmol), gave 66 mg of product (0.15 mmol, 60%). Entry 3: 92 mg of starting material (0.22 mmol), 1 mg of Rh2(cap)4 used gave 31 mg of product (0.072 mmol, 33%). Entry 4: 130 mg of starting material (0.31 mmol), 1 mg of Rh2(cap)4 used gave 50 mg of product (0.12 mmol, 37%) and 8 mg of 27 (0.019 mmol, 6%). Entry 5: 83 mg of starting material (0.2 mmol), 1 mg of CuI used gave 50 mg of product isolated (0.12 mmol, 58%).\nIn summary, dirhodium(II) caprolactamate is a selective and efficient catalyst for TBHP oxidations of the allylic C-H bond. The method features high selectivity, low catalyst loading (usually 0.025 mol%-1 mol%), mild conditions, and a broad substrate scope. Substrates that enunciate Rh2(cap)4 limitations on allylic oxidations are acyclic olefins, whereas acyclic enones are applicable for this type of oxidation. The reagent's application to allylic oxidations in the total synthesis of natural products demonstrates its utility."

A 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated, oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 35 x 7 mm), a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum, a CaCl2 drying tube, and a rubber septum, is charged with (R)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (12.1 g, 42.3 mmol) (Note 3). Anhydrous dichloromethane (66 mL) (Note 4) is added to the reaction flask via syringe and stirring is initiated. The suspension is cooled in an ice water bath (internal temp = 3 \u00b0C). N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (26.1 mL, 150 mmol) (Note 5) is added over 1 min via syringe, resulting in an increase in internal temperature to 9 \u00b0C. Chloromethyl methyl ether (12.1 mL, 159 mmol) (Note 6) and anhydrous dichloromethane (15 mL) (Note 4) are added to the dropping funnel and mixed manually. The resulting solution is added dropwise to the colorless reaction mixture over 0.5 h, resulting in the evolution of HCl gas. Upon completion of the addition, the ice bath is removed and the deep purple reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (22-23 \u00b0C) and stirred for 19 h to form a clear, orange solution. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Note 7). The reaction mixture is poured into de-ionzied water (200 mL) in a 500-mL separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with de-ionized water (50 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL) and the washings are added to the separatory funnel. The organic layer (bottom) is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with aqueous HCl (1 M, 100 mL), aqueous NaHCO3 (5%, 100 mL), and dried over Na2SO4 (25 g). After filtration, the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 30 \u00b0C and further dried under vacuum (25 mmHg) to give 15.8 g of a brown solid.

The solution is removed from heat and allowed to stand without stirring overnight. The flask is placed in an ice bath for 0.5 h and the solids are collected on a disposable 100-mL, 10 micron polyethylene fritted funnel (Note 9). The yellow crystals are washed with ice-cold hexane (2 x 5 mL) and dried in a vacuum oven (40 \u00b0C, 25 mmHg) to yield (R)-1 (13.6 g, 86%) (Notes 10 and 11).\nFigure 1. Step A photographs.

An oven-dried 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar (oval-shaped, 45 x 25 mm), two rubber septa and a 100-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with (R)-2,2'-bis(methoxymethoxy)-1,1'-binaphthyl ((R)-1) (10.0 g, 26.7 mmol) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (90 mL) (Note 13). The atmosphere is purged with N2 for 5 min with stirring (400 rpm). The resulting solution is cooled in an ice water bath (internal temp = 3 \u00b0C). Butyllithium solution (18.3 mL, 1.60 M, 29.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 14) is added to the dropping funnel via syringe and added dropwise to the reaction mixture at such a rate that the internal temperature did not exceed 5 \u00b0C (~10min). Additional anhydrous THF (6 mL) (Note 13) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse butyllithium solution into the reaction mixture. The resulting brown, homogeneous solution is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 4 h, during which time a color change is observed from brown to dark green. A separate oven-dried 100 mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen and charged with iodine (11.6 g, 45.5 mmol, 1.7 equiv) (Note 15). Anhydrous THF (65 mL) (Note 4) is added via syringe and the flask is swirled to dissolve iodine. The solution of iodine is transferred to the dropping funnel via syringe and additional anhydrous THF (7 mL) (Note 4) is added to the flask to rinse iodine to the dropping funnel. The reaction flask is cooled in dry ice-acetone bath (internal temp = -72 \u00b0C) and the solution of iodine is added dropwise over 10 min, resulting in an increase in internal temperature to -64 \u00b0C.

The reaction mixture is then stirred at 0 \u00b0C (internal temperature) for an additional 40 h. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Note 14).\nFigure 4.

The resulting white slurry is stirred at room temperature for 10 min before being filtered through a pad of Celite (2 cm layer) (Note 15) (Figure 5) using a sintered-glass filter (7 cm), and washing with ethyl acetate(100 mL).\nFigure 5.

The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with aqueous NaHCO3 (5%, 150 mL), brine (150 mL), and dried over Na2SO4 (20 g). After filtration, the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to give 6.93 g of a yellow oil. Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel produced a mixture of compounds (R)-1 and (R)-2 (Note 16). The fractions containing (R)-1 and (R)-2 are concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to give 6.18 g of a colorless oil. The title compound is distilled from this oil, in the presence of K2CO3 (0.2 g), under vacuum with a Kugelrohr apparatus (0.05 mmHg, 170 \u00b0C) to give (R)-2 as a colorless liquid (5.72 g, 93%, 90% ee) (Notes 17 and 18).\nThe filtered titanium salts are scraped off of the Celite plug and placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 35 x 7 mm). The flask is charged with aqueous HCl (1 N, 100 mL) and diethyl ether (100 mL), stirred for 2 h at room temperature (Figure 6), filtered, and washed with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with aqueous NaHCO3 (5%, 100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4 (20 g). After filtration, the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to give a residue. This residue is taken into CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and combined with the residue of the Kugelrohr distillation. The mixture is filtered to remove the K2CO3 and then the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (40 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C and further dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) to give 0.44 g of a brown residue, which partially solidified upon standing. This residue is added to a 20 mL screw-cap vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 8 x 30 mm). Hexanes (2.2 mL) are added to the vial and the resulting slurry is stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h. The slurry is filtered under vacuum and the filter cake is washed with cold (ca. 5 \u00b0C) hexanes (2 x 2 mL) and then dried under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) overnight to give ligand (R)-1 as a colorless, amorphous solid (0.159 g) (59% recovery).\nFigure 6.

The gray mixture is stirred for 5 min at 23 \u00baC. An aqueous saturated potassium carbonate solution (1.26 mL, 10.2 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 5) is added and the resulting green mixture is vigorously stirred (1100 rpm) at 23 \u00baC for 12 h (Note 6).\nFigure 1.

            "Enantiopure 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes and their dichlorodiol precursors have proven to be useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex natural products. Since 2000, the Organic Syntheses article2 and the primary reference3 have been cited over 100 times. While these C2 symmetric bis-electrophiles have most commonly been employed in the installation of anti-1,3 diol motifs, they have also recently been leveraged in development of new methods and utilized in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. These applications, as well as the use of these materials in the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products, will be discussed.\nThe original procedure (Scheme 1A) utilizes a reversible acyl transfer reaction of acetylacetone (1) using aluminum trichloride and chloroacetyl chloride.4 The reaction is driven forward through removal of acetyl chloride by distillation and the resulting dichlorodione is isolated (57-58% yield) as copper complex 2. The dione is then liberated from the metal under acidic conditions and subjected to Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation5,6,7,8,9 under high pressure to give dichlorodiol R,R-3 in 40% yield after recrystallization, which undergoes double cyclization under basic conditions to form bis-epoxide R,R-4 (92% yield; >97% ee). The initial report also demonstrates the title compound's utility in synthesizing 1,3-diol motifs (Scheme 1B).3 Treatment of bis-epoxide 4 with unhindered nucleophiles affords symmetric anti-1,3-diols (5) in high yields (61-96%). Controlled monoadditions to bis-epoxide 4 using organolithium species at low temperatures in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt210 provide epoxy alcohols (6) in good yields (56-79%). These epoxy alcohols can be efficiently converted to differentially substituted anti-1,3-diols (7) upon treatment with a second nuceophile (63-89% yields), or converted to syn-1,3-diols through Mitsunobu inversion11,12 of the free hydroxyl. Early applications of these anti-1,3-diol strategies are highlighted in the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin13 and roflamycoin.14\nScheme 1. Synthesis of (R,R)-1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane; double addition and sequential addition to the bis-epoxide with organometallic nucleophiles\nSimultaneous Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nIn Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin (11, Scheme 2), the ethereal tetrahydropyran (THP) ring provided a natural application of the double addition strategy.13 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with an excess of vinylmagnesium bromide in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuI at -78 \u00b0C provided bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 in 90% yield. Diol 8 underwent an acid-catalyzed transacetalization to afford high yields of acetal 9. The C2 symmetric acetal was then poised to undergo an intramolecular Prins cyclization15/desymmetrization with concomitant acetate trapping to provide THP-diacetate 10 in 42% overall yield. This noteworthy sequence leveraged the symmetry of the bis-epoxide to correctly install the 2,4,6-cis-THP stereochemistry, as well as the C19 stereocenter. The bis-homoallylic diol (8) generated by this double addition strategy has proven useful in a number of other synthetic programs.\nScheme 2. Rychnovsky's synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin\nThe synthesis of (+)-obolactone (14, Scheme 3) by Br\u00fcckner and Walleser employed the same conditions from the synthesis of 17-deoxyroflamycoin to transform bis-epoxide R,R-4 to bis-homoallylic diol S,S-8.16 Diol 8 was then protected using 2,2-dimethoxypropane under acidic conditions to provide acetonide 12 in 95% yield. One of the alkene functional groups of the C2-symmetric acetal underwent a subsequent symmetry-breaking Wacker oxidation.17,18,19 Treatment of acetonide 12 with catalytic PdCl2 under an atmosphere of oxygen using CuCl as the stoichiometric oxidant afforded a 64% yield of methyl ketone 13, with over-oxidation to the diketone also observed (18% yield). The methyl ketone functionality of 13 was critical for the installation of the dihydro-\u03b3-pyranone moiety in the natural product, while the syn-orientation of the C\u00ad-O bonds was achieved through Mitsunobu inversion of the lactone stereocenter. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser specifically mention that while Krische and co-workers have reported on an impressive single-step procedure for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of bis-homoallylic diol (S,S-4) from 1,3-propanediol (Scheme 4),20 and have used this method extensively in the synthesis of polyketide natural products,21,22 the high cost of catalyst and ligand precluded their use on scale in this case.\nScheme 3. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's synthesis of (+)-obolactone\nScheme 4. Krische's one-step synthesis of S,S-8.\nBr\u00fcckner and Walleser also used bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 as the starting point for their work on a unified synthetic strategy toward ent-filipin III and ent-pentamycin (20 & 21), as shown in Scheme 5.23 Symmetry-breaking Mitsunobu inversion of bis-homoallylic diol R,R-8 was achieved by treatment with crotonic acid, triphenyl phosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) in toluene to give monoester 16 in 62% yield. The free hydroxyl group of 16 was then converted to sulfonate ester 17 in high yield using vinylsulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. Tetraene 17 was subjected to double ring closing metathesis using Grubbs II catalyst24 in toluene at 100 \u00b0C to afford bicyclic intermediate 18. This bicyclic lactone was further elaborated to acetonide 19 constituting a synthesis of the C1-C10 or \"southwestern\" portion of the polyketides.\nScheme 5. Br\u00fcckner and Walleser's approach to ent-filipin and ent-pentamycin\nAnother example of double addition using an organomagnesium nucleophile was utilized in Eustache and co-workers synthesis of attenol A (27, Scheme 6).25 Treatment of bis-epoxide R,R-4 with 3-butenylmagnesium bromide in the presence of CuI at -40 \u00b0C provided diene diol S,S-22 in 88% yield. Diol S,S-22 was then converted to PMP-acetal 23 in high yield (88%) through acid-catalyzed transacetalization. Reductive cleavage of the benzylic C-O bond by the action of sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions afforded PMB ether 24 in 76% yield. The free hydroxyl group of mono-protected diol 24 was then poised for intermolecular iodoetherification when treated with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in the presence of potassium carbonate. The resulting differentially protected diol derivative 25 was obtained in 80% yield and carried forward as inconsequential mixture of diastereomers to access spiroketal 26 en route to attentol A.\nScheme 6. Eustache's synthesis of attenol A\nPerhaps the most complex example of simultaneous double addition is seen in Smith and Pitrem's synthesis of the Schrieber trisacetonide in their synthesis of mycoticins A and B (33 & 34, Scheme 7).26,27 This single-pot, five-component linchpin coupling strategy utilized bis-epoxide S,S-4 as the central five carbon piece of the C16-C28 fragment of the natural products. The sequence began with lithiation of silyl dithiane 28, which opened the epoxide of (-)-benzyl glycidyl ether 29 to give alkoxide 30. Upon warming, the transient intermediate underwent an intramolecular [1,4]-Brook rearrangement28,29 to generate an organolithium poised for double addition into bis-epoxide S,S-4 to afford diol 31 in 59% overall yield. This remarkable sequence forged four C-C bonds and provided the entire carbon framework of the C16-C28 fragment in a single operation.\nScheme 7. Smith's synthesis of mycoticin A and B\nIn an interesting example of post-double addition functionalization, Tang and Werness were able to exploit the C2-symmetry of bis-epoxide R,R-4 to synthesize the 2,5-cis-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran (THF) core of the marine sesquiterpene (-)-kumausallene (37, Scheme 8).30 Their strategy employed bis-allylic diol R,R-35, which was accessed through a protocol developed by Hanson and co-workers (vide infra). Treatment of diol 35 with a catalytic amount of PdCl2 in the presence of CO and NaOAc using CuCl2 as the stoichiometric oxidant initiated a carbonylative cascade reaction31,32 to provide bicyclic lactone 36 in 87% yield. This key transformation installed the requisite stereochemistry of the central portion of the natural product, as well as appropriate synthetic handles for further functionalization.\nScheme 8. Tang's synthesis of (-)-kumausallene\nSequential Double Addition Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis\nFor Rychnovsky and co-worker's synthesis of roflamycoin (45), the hemiketal-pyran linkage required differential substitution (Scheme 9) and demonstrated the power of the sequential double addition strategy.14 Treatment of bis-epoxide S,S-4 with a stoichiometric amount of (benzyloxy)methyllithium 38 and BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C provided mono-addition adduct 39, which was then treated with the organolithium formed from transmetallation of 2,2-bis-(tributyltin)dithiane 40. This single-pot procedure afforded dithiane diol 41 in 56% overall yield. Subsequent acetonide formation and transmetallation provided a competent nucleophile for direct displacement of dibromide42, which itself was derived from dichlorodiol R,R-3. The resulting bis-acetonide (43) was obtained in 60% overall yield and provided a rapid access to tris-acetonide 44, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the hemiketal-pyran moiety of 45. Similar sequential addition strategies have proven to be useful as well.\nScheme 9. Rychnovsky's synthesis of roflamycoin\nThough most commonly used in the synthesis of polyketide natural products, Evans and co-workers were able to employ bis-epoxide R,R-4 in the synthesis of polycyclic guanidinium alkaloid (-)-batzelladine D (51, Scheme 10).33 Addition of the transiently formed cuprate derived from catalytic CuCN and octyl Grignard reagent in the presence of BF3\u2022OEt2 in THF at -78 \u00b0C led to formation of mono-addition adduct 46 in 71% yield. The resulting epoxy alcohol (46) was then treated with the ylide generated from the in situ deprotonation of trimethylsulfonium triflate to afford 95% yield of anti-1,3-diol 47. Conversion of diol 47 to cyclic carbonate 48 was achieved in 90% yield by treatment with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and pyridine. Cyclic carbonate 48 was then employed as the electrophile in a rhodium-catalyzed allylic amination.34 The LiHMDS-mediated deprotonation of dihydropyrimidinone 49 provided a nucleophile, which in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst and trimethyl phosphite displaced the allylic carbonate to forge the C-N bond of 50 in high conversion and selectivity (84% yield; dr \u2265 30:1). This sequence rapidly provided the required stereochemistry for the bicyclic guanidinium portion of (-)-batzelladine D.\nScheme 10. Evan's synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D\nHanson's synthesis of chiral bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triester building blocks\nWhile Mioskowski's conversion of epoxides to homologated allylic alcohols35 was used in Evans' synthesis of (-)-batzelladine D, the use of this transformation as it pertains to 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentanes was pioneered by Hanson and co-workers for their research in synthesis of phosphate triester building blocks.36 The simultaneous double addition of sulfonium ylides onto either chiral bis-epoxide S,S-4 or dichlorodiol S,S-3 to give the corresponding bis-allylic diol S,S-35 proceeded in high yields (76% and 80% yield, respectively) (Scheme 11).37 This was a critical reaction in the synthesis of chiral phosphate triesters. Condensation of diol 35 onto POCl3 in the presence of Et3N and DMAP provided cyclic chlorophosphate diester 52. Final chloride displacement was carried out with lithium allyloxide in THF at -40 \u00b0C to afford triene 53, which underwent a ring-closing metathesis reaction in the presence of Grubbs II catalyst24 to provide phosphate triester S,S,PS-54.\nScheme 11. Hanson's synthesis of tris-allylic phosphate triesters\nHanson and co-workers have shown these tethered phosphate esters to be versatile intermediates for organic synthesis.36 In addition to synthesis of complex natural products such as those seen in Figure 1,38,39,40,41 recent extensions of this technology include probing the complementary reactivity of the corresponding phosphite-borane tethers.42,43 While these reports demonstrate the utility of P-tethered building blocks, perhaps none more clearly highlight the versatility of these intermediates than Hanson's approach to dolabelide C.41 Retrosynthetic analysis of this 24-membered macrolide produced by the sea hare D. auricularia (58, Scheme 12) divided the macrolactone into two large fragments (59 and 60) that can come from the enantiomeric phosphate triesters R,R,PR-54 and S,S,PS-54.\nFigure 1. Complex products synthesized using phosphate triester building blocks\nScheme 12. Hanson's retrosynthetic analysis of dolabelide C\nSynthesis of the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C, shown in Scheme 13, began with cross metathesis of phosphate triester R,R,PR-54 and alkene 61 in the presence of the 2nd generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst44,45,46 to give phosphate diene 62. Regioselective reduction of the exocyclic alkene in 62 required treatment with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazine and Et3N as the phosphate esters are not tolerant of more basic diimide reduction protocols. The resulting cyclic alkene 63 was then subjected to a Pd-catalyzed formate reduction that regioselectively delivered hydride to the C10 position resulting in the desired terminal alkene 64. With a majority of the northwest coupling fragment assembled, alkene 64 was further elaborated to carboxylic acid 59 in 11 steps.\nScheme 13. Hanson's approach to the C1-C14 fragment of dolabelide C\nA similar cross metathesis/reduction strategy was employed for the 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment (Scheme 14) to convert S,S,PS-54 to cyclic alkene 67. In this case, regio- and diastereoselective methyl cuprate addition proceeded in an SN2\u2032 fashion to afford terminal alkene 68. This advanced intermediate was carried through another 10 steps to provide southwest fragment 60. Though containing a problematic MOM protecting group strategy, the 1st generation synthesis of this fragment also demonstrated the phosphate triester moiety's tolerance to both hydroboration/oxidation conditions, as well as an acidic PMB protection protocol.\nScheme 14. Hanson's 2nd generation synthesis of the C15-C30 fragment of dolabelide C\nHanson's chiral phosphate triesters have proven to be useful building blocks for organic synthesis with new modes of reactivity still to be discovered. Advancements in this technology were facilitated by the synthetic route developed for the bis-epoxide and dichlorodiol precursors, which speaks to the reliability of the procedure. In addition to enabling new technologies, these intermediates have also found utility in the context of providing straightforward access to enantioenriched variants of classically important synthetic intermediates.\nAub\u00e9's extension through synthesis of valuable chiral building blocks\nAs shown in Figure 2, 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenones (4-HCP) have long been a privileged scaffold in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, including prostaglandins, alkaloids and terpene natural products.47,48,49 As such, the ability to access either enantiomer of this class of molecules has been a long standing area of interest for synthetic organic chemists. Aub\u00e9 and co-workers provided a compelling strategy to synthesize a variety of hydroxyl protected 4\u00ad-HCP derivatives in enantioenriched forms.50 The synthetic strategy, shown in Scheme 15, involves using Hanson's protocol to access bis-allylic diol R,R-35 from dichlorodiol R,R-3. Monoprotection of C2-symmetric diol R,R-35 proceeded in high yields (66-95%) for a variety of protecting groups. The resulting dienes (72) were able to smoothly undergo a RCM reaction using Grubbs I catalyst51 to give cyclopentenol derivatives (73, 88-92% yields), which were then oxidized with pyridium chlorochromate to the corresponding cyclopentenones (74) in high yields (92-94%) on gram scale. In addition, this report also provided conditions for further functionalization of both the cyclopentenol derivatives and 4-HCPs.\nFigure 2. Select examples of natural products synthesized using 4-HCPs\nScheme 15. Aub\u00e9's synthesis of enantioenriched 4-HCP derivatives\nSingh and Aub\u00e9 used dichlorodiol R,R-3 as a key intermediate in their syntheses of spatially directed cyclohexane-1,3-diols (Scheme 16).52 Analogous to the monoprotection of bis-allylic diol R,R-35, dichlorodiol R,R-3 underwent monohydroxyl protection by the action of TIPSCl in the presence of n-BuLi to afford dichloride 75 in 92% yield. To synthesize cyclohexyl derivatives, dichloride 75 was then converted to chloroepoxide 76 in 95% yield under basic conditions. In the presence of Smith's linchpin dithiane 77, chloroepoxide 76 underwent an epoxide opening/Brook rearrangement sequence. The transient carbanion subsequently displaced the remaining chloride to provide differentially protected cyclohexane 78, which can be selectively deprotected in a variety of ways. This method is complementary to the work of Linclau et al., who used dithiane linchpin coupling on bis-epoxides (e.g. 4) to construct cyclopentyl nucleosides.53,54\nScheme 16. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of cyclohexyl trans-1,3-diols\nIn addition to cyclohexane-1,3-diols, Singh and Aub\u00e9 also used dichloride 75 to synthesize piperidine and thiane derivatives as well (Scheme 17). In the case of piperidine derivatives, dichloride 75 was first converted to diiodide 82 through a double Finkelstein reaction.55,56 This more potent bis-electrophile was primed to undergo a double displacement with benzylamine to give piperidine 83 in 88% yield. The increased nucleophilicity of sulfur meant that dichloride 75 was a competent bis-electrophile for the double displacement and provided thiane 85 in 88% yield when treated with sodium sulfide. These heterocycles also underwent standard silyl group cleavage to give the corresponding 1,3-diols (84 and 86) in high yields (94% and 92%, respectively).\nScheme 17. Singh and Aub\u00e9's synthesis of piperidinyl and thianyl trans-1,3-diols\nConcluding Remarks\nThe enantiopure forms of 1,2:4,5-diepoxypentane (4) and dichlorodiol (3) have been used by many groups as chiral precursors for organic synthesis. The original procedure is convenient and scalable, providing access to either enantiomer based on readily available and inexpensive chiral BINAP ligands. Displacement at the primary positions lead to a variety of simple enantiopure cyclic and acyclic building blocks. These typically occur either through simultaneous double addition of organometallic nucleophiles to give C2 symmetric diols or sequential double addition to give asymmetric diols. While the resulting 1,3-diol motif has most commonly found utility in the context of polyketide natural product synthesis, applications to alkaloid and terpene natural products have also been described. In addition, this method has provided straightforward access to bicyclo[4.3.1]phosphate triesters and 4-hydroxycyclopentenones derivatives, themselves valuable synthetic intermediates. Based on these recent developments, 4 and 3 will continue to provide synthetic chemists with useful entry points for chiral synthesis and enable new modes of reactivity."

A 500-mL, round-bottomed, two-necked flask (24/40 joints) containing a 16 x 37 mm Teflon-coated, ellipsoid-shaped magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a rubber septum on one neck through which is inserted a thermocouple probe and with a gas inlet adapter on the other neck. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, refilled with argon and cooled to 22 \u00b0C. The rubber septum is removed and (R)-(+)-1,1-binaphthyl-2,2-diamine (R)-1 (5.29 g, 18.6 mmol, Note 2) is added through a plastic funnel under increased argon flow, followed by anhydrous dichloromethane (160 mL). The rubber septum is placed back into the neck and pyridine (12.0 mL, 148.8 mmol, 8.0 equiv) is added dropwise using a 20 mL syringe (addition time of 1 min) (Note 3). The resulting yellow solution is cooled to 4 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with an ice-bath and freshly distilled ethyl chloroformate (3.91 mL, 40.92 mmol, 2.2 equiv) is added dropwise via a 5 mL syringe (addition time of 10 min) (Note 4). The reaction mixture is stirred in the ice bath for 1 h at 3\u22124 \u00b0C. The flask is then removed from the cooling bath and the mixture is stirred for 30 min at 22 \u00b0C (Note 5) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Reaction mixture upon warm-up to 22 \u00b0C\nThe gas inlet adapter is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a 2.0 M aq. solution of KOH (100 mL), which is added to the reaction mixture over 10 min followed by stirring for an additional 20 min at 22 \u00b0C. The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with a 1 M aq. solution of HCl (2 x 150 mL) and brine (1 x 150 mL), and the extracts are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (2.5 g). The dried organic phase is vacuum-filtered (house vacuum, ~10 mmHg) through a glass funnel with glass wool into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and the MgSO4 is washed with dichloromethane (2 x 20 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (28 \u00b0C, 32 mmHg) and then dried under vacuum (1.0 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C, 12 h) to afford (R)-2 as white foam (7.79 g, 98%) (Note 6, Note 7 and Note 8) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

An oven-dried, 500-mL round-bottomed, two-necked flask (24/40 joints) with a 16 x 37 mm Teflon-coated ellipsoid-shaped magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a rubber septum in one neck and a reflux condenser (length of jacket -200 mm) with a gas inlet adapter in the other neck. The flask is evacuated under vacuum, refilled with argon, placed in an ice-bath followed by the addition of anhydrous THF (75 mL) via syringe through the septum. The rubber septum is removed and under increased argon flow lithium aluminum hydride (5.06 g, 133.5 mmol, 11.0 equiv) is added through a plastic funnel in small portions (addition over 10 min) (Note 9). The resulting suspension is stirred for 10 min and a solution of (R)-diethyl [1,1'-binaphthalene]-2,2'-diyldicarbamate (R)-2 (5.2 g, 12.14 mmol) in anhydrous THF (25 mL) is added to the reaction mixture dropwise over 12 min. The flask containing (R)-2 is rinsed with THF (2 x 3 mL) and the washes are added to the reaction mixture (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Reaction set up for (R)-2\nThe ice bath is replaced with an oil bath and the rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper. The oil bath is gradually heated to 75 \u00b0C and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 15 h. The resulting green reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 22 \u00b0C (Note 10) and diethyl ether (400 mL) is added. The mixture is cooled in an ice-bath for 10 min. The gas inlet adapter is removed and H2O (5.1 mL) is added dropwise to the reaction mixture through the condenser using a pipette. In a similar fashion, 3 M NaOH (5.1 mL) and H2O (15.3 mL) are added (Note 11), and the resulting mixture is stirred for 10 min before celite (10 g) is added to the suspension through the inlet closer to the reaction solution. A medium-porosity, 15 cm diameter sintered glass funnel filled with 1 inch of celite, is pre-equilibrated with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate is removed by vacuum filtration into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask and discarded before 1 inch of sand is added to the top of the now-dry celite. The reaction suspension is filtered through this pad (Figure 4) rinsing the flask with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL) to aid in transfer. The vacuum is removed when the solvent reaches the top of the filter cake. Ethyl acetate (50 mL) is added, and the celite filter cake is stirred with a spatula, then the supernatant solvent is filtered, again removing vacuum when the solvent reaches the top of the filter cake. This process is repeated twice before filtering all liquid exhaustively. The filtrate is dried with Na2SO4 (20 g) and filtered through a plastic funnel with a cotton plug, rinsing with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 32 mmHg) and placed under high vacuum (< 1.0 mmHg, 22 \u00b0C, 36 h) to afford (R)-3 as a yellow foam (3.71 g, 98%) (Note 12, Note 13 and Note 14) (Figure 5).\nFigure 4.

The flask is evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen three times. Phosphorus trichloride (2.0 mL, 22.9 mmol) is added via syringe through a rubber septum, followed by the addition of hexanes (50 mL) via syringe (Note 3) (Figure 1). The resulting solution is cooled to +2 \u00b0C (internal temperature) with an ice-bath, and diisopropylamine (6.0 mL, 42.8 mmol, 1.87 equiv) (Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe over 10 min, whereupon the solution immediately turns into a white suspension.

The flask is then removed from the cooling bath and the solution is stirred for 20 min such that the internal temperature reaches 8 \u00b0C and the orange color intensifies. Then the flask is immersed back into the dry ice/i-PrOH bath and the solution is stirred for another 30 min. When the solution reaches an internal temperature of \u221274 \u00b0C, a solution of dichloro(diisopropylamino)phosphine 1 (0.91 mL, 5.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in THF (8 mL) is added dropwise via syringe over 10 min (Note 12). The flask is then removed from the cooling bath and the solution is stirred for 45 min as the internal temperature reaches +18 \u00b0C and the solution turns from bright orange to yellow. The rubber septum is removed and under increased nitrogen flow selenium powder (1.18 g, 15.0 mmol, 3.0 equiv) is then added in one portion with a spatula whereupon the color turns brown-black immediately.

            "A.Azacyclotridecane (2). A 300-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask (29/32 central neck, 15/25 side necks) is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (octagon, 2.4 x 0.8 cm) (Notes 1 and 2). The side necks are fitted with 15/25 rubber septa and the central neck is equipped with a connecting adapter (29/32 upper outer joint, 15/25 lower inner joint) and a water-jacketed reflux condenser (30.0 cm height, 15/25 joint). The reflux condenser is topped with a 15/25 glass adapter connected to a Schlenk line (Figure 1). All glassware junctures are sealed with Teflon tape. The flask is charged with nickel (II) chloride ethylene glycol dimethyl ether complex (1.00 g, 4.56 mmol, 0.100 equiv) and 12-aminododecanolactam (1) (9.00 g, 45.6 mmol, 1.00equiv) (Note 3) through a side neck of the flask. The rubber septa of the side necks are secured and sealed with Teflon tape. The reaction vessel is evacuated for 5 min and backfilled with argon three times. Toluene (46 mL, 1.0 M) (Note 4) is then added to the reaction mixture via syringe and through the 15/25 rubber septum on a side neck of the flask. The reflux condenser is kept at 23 \u00b0C with a constant flow of water. The reaction vessel is placed in a pre-heated 115 \u00b0C oil bath and stirred for 10 min (Figure 2). Phenylsilane (9.87 g, 91.2 mmol, 11.2 ml, 2.00 equiv) (Note 5) is then added dropwise via syringe pump (0.1 mL/min, 11.2 mL, 12.0 mL syringe) through the 15/25 rubber septum on a side neck of the flask (Figure 3). During the addition, the reaction changes color from orange to black with hydrogen gas evolution (Figure 4) (Note 6). Upon complete addition of phenylsilane, the reaction is stirred for 24 h in the 115 \u00b0C oil bath. An argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system.\nFigure 1.

Addition of phenylsilane by syringe pump\nFigure 4. (a) The reaction mixture before the addition of phenylsilane; (b) The reaction mixture immediately after the complete addition of phenylsilane\nAfter the allotted time, the reaction vessel is removed from the oil bath and cooled to 23 \u00b0C over 20 min. Once at 23 \u00b0C, the reaction is diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) (Note 7) and stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min. A solution of 1.0M aqueous NaOH (0.5 mL) (Note 8) is added and the reaction is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for an additional 5 min. This process is repeated four times (Figure 5) (Note 9). Subsequently, a larger portion of 1.0 M aqueous NaOH (3.0 mL) is added and the resulting mixture is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 5 min. The crude reaction mixture is then transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel. The 300-mL round-bottom flask is rinsed with EtOAc (40 mL) and the resulting solution is added to the separatory funnel. Additional 1.0 M aqueous NaOH (3 x 10 mL) is added to the separatory funnel, followed by EtOAc (50 mL) and a saturated aqueous NaCl solution (100 mL) (Figure 6) (Notes 10 and 11). The layers are separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (100 mL), dried for 10 min over anhydrous Na2SO4 (150 g) (Note 12),and filtered over a fritted glass funnel (inner diameter: 7.5 cm, height: 6.0 cm) into a 1-L round-bottom flask (Figure 7). The filter cake is rinsed with EtOAc (4 x 50 mL) and the resulting mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (780 to 40 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature) to give a dark green oil (26.5 g) (Figure 8) (Note 13).\nFigure 5.Reaction mixture after quenching with 1.0 M aqueous NaOH\nFigure 6.(a) The reaction mixture in separatory funnel after the addition of EtOAc, 1.0 M NaOH, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (b) The reaction mixture after sitting for 20 min\nFigure 7.Set-up of reaction filtration Figure 8.Crude dark green oil\nTo the round-bottom flask, which contains the crude reaction mixture, is added a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (octagon, 4.2 x 1.8 cm) and hexanes (300 mL) (Notes 14 and 15). Next, the mixture is stirred for 2 h at 23 \u00b0C (Figure 9). The resulting precipitate is removed via filtration using a fritted glass funnel (inner diameter: 7.5 cm, height: 6.0 cm) packed with celite (20.0 g) (Note 16). The filtrate is collected in a 1-L round-bottom flask (Figure 10), and the filter cake is rinsed with hexanes (200 mL) (Note 17). The volatiles are removed by rotary evaporation (780 to 90 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature) to afford the crude reaction material as an orange oil (12.2 g) (Figure 11).\nFigure 9.

The fractions containing desired product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (780 to 100 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature). The purified material is placed under vacuum (2.5 mmHg) for 3 h and then for an additional 1 h (0.5 mmHg) to afford azacyclotridecane (2) (7.06 g, 84% yield) as a light green oil (Figure 12) (Notes 20 and 21).\nFigure 12.

A 100 mL, flame-dried, two-necked round-bottomed flask (the central neck: 15/25 joint, side neck: 15/25 joint) is equipped with a 2.4 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar. The side-neck is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum. The central neck is equipped with a water-jacked reflux condenser (25.0 cm height, 15/25 joint). Top of the condenser is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum, which is equipped with an inlet needle connected to a Schlenk line. The reflux condenser is kept at ambient temperature with a constant flow of water (Figure 1).The assembled apparatus is charged with 9H-carbazole (3.68 g, 22.0 mmol, 4.4 equiv) (Notes 2 and 3) through the side-neck of the flask. The reaction vessel is then evacuated for 5 min and backfilled with argon three times. Then the flask is charged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (36 mL) (Notes 4 and 5) via a 60 mL syringe through the 15/25 rubber septum on the side-neck of the flask. The stirred, homogeneous solution (Figure 2a) is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath for 10 min, then the flask is charged with a solution of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in tetrahydrofuran (2 M, 10.5 mL, 21.0 mmol, 4.2 equiv) (Figure 2b)(Note 6) using a 12 mL syringe, dropwise over five min (Note 7).\nFigure 1.

The reaction vessel is placed in a pre-heated oil bath at 65 \u00b0C. The contents of the flask are stirred under an argon atmosphere at this temperature (Figure 5).

            "Monofluoromethylation is an important transformation that has been employed as a strategy to introduce fluoroalkyl functionalities into molecules.2 Among the known reactions, nucleophilic monofluoromethylation stands out as an important approach in which a fluoroalkyl anion is generated and reacted with a suitable electrophile. Fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) has been widely employed as a pronucleophile given that the electron-withdrawing nature of the phenylsulfonyl groups increases the acidity of the proton in the adjacent carbon atom, making its deprotonation facile and giving rise to a resonance-stabilized fluoromethide species3 that can react with several electrophiles. This compound was first synthesized by Shibata et al., through the electrophilic fluorination of bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane4 and was later used as a nucleophilic monofluoromethylating reagent. Prakash and coworkers envisioned a large-scale procedure to synthesize FBSM in reagent quantities (Figure 1).5\nFigure 1. Prakash's large-scale synthesis of FBSM\nThe present addendum discloses the transformations available employing FBSM as a monofluoromethylation reagent (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1. FBSM as a masked nucleophile\nMichael Reactions with FBSM\nMichael reactions are one of the most important synthetic avenues to impart structural complexity to organic molecules. The acidity of FBSM enables its facile deprotonation even when using mild bases, with the resultant anion being a good nucleophile which has been reacted with a variety of Michael acceptors, furnishing C-protected monofluoromethyl compounds. One of the earliest of such transformations was performed by Prakash and coworkers in 2008 (Scheme 2).6 The authors prepared and screened a variety of fluoro(phenylsulfonyl)methanes, with the third substituent being a phenylsulfonyl, nitro, cyano, ester or ketone group. In reactions with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated compounds, trimethylphosphine was found to be the most efficient catalyst, furnishing the desired products in moderate to excellent yields (Scheme 2a). The reaction is proposed to proceed via initial addition of the electron-rich phosphine to the electrophilic carbon of the Michael acceptor, producing the active base: a \u03b2-phosphonio enolate. Note that analogous intermediates are well documented in the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. Deprotonation of FBSM by the formed base, followed by subsequent attack of the newly-formed nucleophile at the C-P+ carbon results in the formation of the desired products, along with the regeneration of the phosphine catalyst (Scheme 2b).\nScheme 2. Phosphine-catalyzed FBSM addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated compounds\nShortly after this seminal work, Hu and coworkers investigated FBSM-type molecules as pronucleophiles in the fluoromethylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones, arynes, and alkynes.7 Each transformation provided a mixture of products, with the ratio of formed species dependent on the hardness/softness of the nucleophile (Scheme 3).\nScheme 3. Addition of FBSM to arynes, alkynes and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones\nA reaction system for the long-elusive chiral monofluoromethylation came from the 2008 work by Shibata and coworkers, wherein FBSM was used as a pronucleophile in an asymmetric 1,4-addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones, with the stereochemistry set by a Cinchona alkaloid-derived ammonium salt.8 Generally high (ee: 84% - 98%) enantiomeric excesses were observed along with good yields. Further functionalization at the carbonyl group was demonstrated via a NaBH4-mediated reduction, keeping the phenylsulfonyl groups intact. Following this, oxidation to restore the carbonyl group results in simultaneous desulfurization, forming a monofluoromethyl group. Alternatively, a Mg0-mediated reduction of the alcohol results in desulfurization to yield the monofluoromethyl derivative (Scheme 4).\nScheme 4. Chiral monofluoromethylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones with FBSM\nChiral enamine catalysis has been extensively employed in the asymmetric functionalization of aldehydes and ketones (Scheme 5). In 2009, the Wang group documented an asymmetric conjugate addition of FBSM to enals, catalyzed by a chiral proline derivative.9 The active electrophile; the in-situ formed \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated iminium ion; is trapped by FBSM to form a \u03b2- substituted enamine. Subsequent hydrolysis of the enamine (loss of the proline derivative) affords the desired products in moderate to good yields and in excellent enantiomeric excess. Adding to the slew of enantioselective fluoromethylations of Michael acceptors, C\u00f3rdova and coworkers added FBSM to 1,2-enals using chiral proline-type catalysts,10 similar to the work of Wang and coworkers.9 The authors used an -OTMS-containing catalyst in place of an -OTBS-containing one, generating the desired monofluoromethyl compounds in good yields. At the same time, Rios and coworkers also published a near-identical synthesis of \u03b2-monofluoromethyl aldehydes.11\nScheme 5. Asymmetric monofluoromethylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones\nAnother method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of FBSM to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones comes in the form of the 2009 paper by Kim and coworkers, wherein chiral primary amine catalysts were used to steer the stereochemical outcome of the reaction towards one enantiomer (Scheme 6).12 The thus formed products were obtained in moderate stereoselectivity and good to excellent yields. Noteworthy is the work of Hu and coworkers on the reversibility of 1,2-additions of FBSM across \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, wherein the formation of 1,4-adducts was observed following the disappearance of the 1,2-adducts.13\nScheme 6. \u03b2-Monofluoromethyl ketones via chiral primary amine catalysis\nDespite iminium catalysis being widespread in organic chemistry, the converse process had not been studied (the conversion of an enamine to an iminium ion). That is, until the 2011 paper by Zhang et al., wherein in situ generated enamines were oxidized by a hypervalent iodine compound (IBX) (Scheme 7). The thus formed iminium ions were then reacted with FBSM, generating \u03b2-fluoromethyl compounds, which were then reduced to the corresponding alcohols using NaBH4.14\nScheme 7. IV-mediated oxidative monofluoromethylation\nAn in situ generated iminium ion, stemming from the desulfurization of an indole derivative, has been used as an electrophile in reactions with FBSM. In this work by Shibata and coworkers, the monofluoromethyl indole derivatives were prepared in excellent yields and generally displayed high enantiomeric excess (Scheme 8).15 As in previous work, radical desulfurization proceeds with retention of stereochemistry.\nScheme 8. Enantioselective monofluoromethylation of indole derivatives\nFinally, in a collaborative effort, the labs of Yang and Rios jointly developed a cascade reaction for the synthesis of fluoroindane and fluorochromanol derivatives.16 The cascade begins with a conjugate addition of FBSM to the iminium ion born as a consequence of condensation between the aldehyde and the chiral amine. Upon the occurrence of a second Michael reaction, the fluoroindane is formed. Using (2-hydroxy)cinnamic acids results in the formation of fluorochromanols (Scheme 9).\nScheme 9. Preparation of fluoroindanes and fluorochromanols\nSubstitution Reactions with FBSM\nSN2': SN2' chemistry offers a viable route to obtain functionalized allylic compounds. The application of this concept to FBSM pronucleophile has facilitated the synthesis of various \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated-\u03b1-fluoromethyl compounds. The first transformation of this type was disclosed collaboratively by Shibata and Toru in 2006 (Scheme 10).4 The authors performed an enantioselective allylic monofluoromethylation of allyl acetates using FBSM in combination with a palladium catalyst and chiral ligand, producing the desired allyl monofluoromethanes in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities.\nScheme 10. Enantioselective Pd-catalyzed allylic monofluoromethylation\nAn analogous reaction catalyzed by iridium in place of palladium was devised by Liu et al., wherein FBSM-containing terminal alkenes were prepared in excellent yields with good enantioselectivity (Scheme 11).17 The authors then proceeded to apply their methodology to the synthesis of monofluoromethyl ibuprofen, which was found to have enhanced analgesic properties.18\nScheme 11. Enantioselective Ir-catalyzed monofluoromethylation of allylic carbonates\nAs part of an investigation into the potency of phosphine-imidazoline ligands when applied to allylic substitution reactions, FBSM was reacted with an allylic acetate to generate the allyl-monofluoromethyl compound in good yield with excellent ee.19 Mei et al. discovered that the optimal catalyst for this system was \u03b73-allyl palladium(II)chloride dimer, and a series of axially-chiral BINAP-type ligands were found suitable for the transformation (Scheme 12).\nScheme 12. Chiral ligand-assisted Pd-catalyzed \u03b1-fluoromethylation\nFinally, Hartwig and coworkers developed a method for the production of tertiary allylic fluorides from tri-substituted alkene derivatives (Scheme 13).20 Catalyzed by an iridium species, the reaction system provided the desired products in moderate to excellent yields.\nScheme 13. Ir-catalyzed synthesis of allylic fluorides\nSN2: Perhaps one of the most studied reactions, SN2 chemistry has become standard textbook science: the reaction of a nucleophile with a primary or secondary carbon with a good leaving group proceeding with inversion of stereochemistry. In 2009, Prakash and coworkers developed a base-mediated monofluoromethylation of primary alkyl halides using FBSM as the pronucleophile.21 The results of this chemistry are substrate-dependent: aliphatic alkyl halides produced the expected SN2 product, and benzyl halides afforded monofluoroolefins instead, facilitating the synthesis of \u03b2-fluorostyrenes (Scheme 14).\nScheme 14. Nucleophilic monofluoromethylation of primary alkyl halides\nMitsunobu-type: Mitsunobu chemistry has been used extensively in the deoxygenative functionalization of primary and secondary alcohols. In 2007, Prakash and coworkers delineated a DIAD/PPh3-mediated deoxygenation-monofluoromethylation of secondary alcohols, producing monofluoromethyl compounds in good to excellent yields (Scheme 15).22 In the case of enantiopure alcohols, the transformation proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry at the chiral alcohol carbon.\nScheme 15. Stereospecific deoxymonofluoromethylation of secondary alcohols\nEpoxide Ring-opening\nEpoxide ring-opening reactions have seen use primarily in the synthesis of \u03b2-substituted alcohols. One approach to \u03b2-monofluoromethyl alcohols was disclosed by Hu and coworkers in 2006.23 On deprotonation with n-BuLi, FBSM was reacted with various epoxides, of which the corresponding monofluoromethane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields (Scheme 16).\nScheme 16. Epoxide ring-opening with FBSM\nMulticomponent Reactions with FBSM\nThe propensity of FBSM to behave as a pronucleophile has encouraged its implementation in multicomponent reactions. The first such system was developed by Shibata and coworkers in 2007, which allowed for the synthesis of \u03b2-monofluoromethyl amines starting from \u03b2-sulfonyl amines and using a chiral phase-transfer catalyst (Scheme 17). The products were furnished in good to excellent yields.\nScheme 17. Monofluoromethylation of amines by phase-transfer catalysis\nIn 2013, Prakash and coworkers presented a Mannich-type reaction between an aldehyde, a secondary amine, and FBSM, producing a variety of monofluoromethyl amines in moderate to good yields.24 The addition of NaH as a base was required for challenging substrates (Scheme 18).\nScheme 18. Synthesis of \u03b2-monofluoromethyl amines through Mannich-type intermediate\nAdditions to Alkenes and Alkynes\nFluoroiodobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM-I) has been prepared by a deprotonation-iodination sequence developed by Prakash and coworkers (Scheme 19),25 and this methodology was later used by Shibata and coworkers in developing novel halogen-bonding catalysts.26 In Prakash's work, the iodomethane derivative was demonstrated to be a viable radical monofluoromethylation reagent, affording the desired monofluoromethyl products in good to excellent yields.\nScheme 19. Radical monofluoromethylation of olefins using FBSM-I\nA palladium-catalyzed allylation of FBSM was later developed by Hu and coworkers.27 Mediated by HOAc, this method furnished the linear products in high yields and excellent regioselectivity (Scheme 20).\nScheme 20. Allylic monofluoromethylation of alkynes\nIn 2009, Shibata and coworkers devised a synthesis of monofluoromethyl allenes from 2-halo-1,3-dienes and FBSM, catalyzed by a palladium species.28 The desired allenes were synthesized in excellent yields (Scheme 21).\nScheme 21. Monofluoromethylation of conjugated dienes\nA transition metal-free, chiral ammonium salt catalyzed, electrophilic alkynylation method was developed by Kamlar et al, yielding alkynyl monofluoromethanes in high yields (Scheme 22).29\nScheme 22. Electrophilic alkynylation of FBSM\nAddition to Morita-Baylis-Hillman Products\nMorita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) products have been extensively used as versatile synthons for the introduction of molecular complexity in substrates of interest. The first fluoromethylation of an MBH-carbonate was reported by Shibata and coworkers in 2011, wherein FBSM was used as a nucleophilic monofluoromethyl source (Scheme 23).30 The use of an axially chiral anthraquinone allowed the authors to obtain allyl-fluoromethyl compounds in moderate to good yields, with high enantioselectivity. Similar work is reported by Yang et al.31\nScheme 23. Enantioselective monofluoromethylation of MBH-carbonates\nLater, Shibata conducted a similar transformation, wherein the base used to deprotonate FBSM was trifluoromethide generated in-situ from (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TMSCF3) (Scheme 24).32\nScheme 24. Trifluoromethide-promoted monofluoromethylation\nAdditional Reactions of FBSM\nFBSM has been added to C(sp2) electrophiles. In 2011, Hu and coworkers disclosed an addition of FBSM to aldehydes, mediated by Li+ coordination (Scheme 25).33 The nature of the cation was found essential in facilitating the addition, as Na+ and K+ bases did not produce favorable results. The desired monofluoromethyl carbinols were obtained in excellent yields.\nScheme 25. Li+-promoted FBSM addition to aldehydes\nFurther elaboration on this type of chemistry was presented by the same group, two years later. Synthesized by the above method,33 monofluoromethyl carbinols were transformed into monofluoroolefins through step-wise treatment with benzyl chloride and then LiHMDS. The olefins were predominantly obtained in the Z configuration, and in good yields (Scheme 26).34\nScheme 26. Monofluoroolefination using FBSM\nA DIAD-mediated \u03b1-fluoromethylation of tertiary amines is reported by Hu and coworkers, via a dehydrogenative coupling of the amines with FBSM (Scheme 27).35 The reaction is postulated to involve an iminium ion intermediate, which acts as the electrophile to react with FBSM nucleophile. The monofluoromethyl products were obtained in moderate to excellent yields.\nScheme 27. Dehydrogenative monofluoromethylation of amines\nPerfluoroalkylsilanes have been extensively used as sources of nucleophilic fluoroalkyl species. The deprotonation-silylation of FBSM, as conducted by Prakash et al., provides access to a reagent requiring mild activation for nucleophilic monofluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds (Scheme 28).36\nScheme 28.

Kojic acid (1, 50.0 g, 0.352 mol, 1 equiv) (Note 2) is then added to the flask through a glass powder funnel on the middle neck. A thermometer with adaptor is connected to the left neck and a gas-adaptor connecting to a HCl scrubber is attached to the right neck (Note 3). The solid is then stirred at 400 rpm for 10 min. The glass powder funnel is removed and replaced by a 250 mL addition funnel topped with a septum (Figure 1A). Thionyl chloride (205 mL, 2.81 mol, 8 equiv) (Note 4) is added by plastic syringe to the addition funnel and then added dropwise to the round-bottomed flask over the course of 1 h. During the first 45 min of thionyl chloride addition, gaseous sulfur dioxide and HCl are generated; after addition is complete, the internal temperature is 35 \u00b0C. The reaction is stirred for an additional 1 h at room temperature (23 \u00b0C). After this time TLC analysis indicates the reaction is complete (Figure 1B) (Note 5). The resultant heterogeneous reaction mixture is vacuum filtered through a 10.5-cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel lined with a 90 mm Whatman qualitative filter paper. The filtrate is collected in a 500 mL filter flask and the light yellow product is washed with chilled hexanes (0 \u00b0C) (2 x 100 mL) (Notes 6 and 7) to obtain an off-white/yellow solid (Figure 1C).\nFigure 1.A) Reaction setup for step A; B) TLC analysis of compound 2 after 1 h; C) Recrystallization setup\nThe solid is transferred through a glass powder funnel to a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a 4-cm oval Teflon-coated stir bar. Chloroform (1.5 L) (Note 8) is added to the Erlenmeyer flask and the resultant heterogeneous mixture is stirred at 800 rpm and heated to reflux (61 \u00b0C) in a heating mantle filled with sand (Note 9). Once the solid is fully dissolved (3 h), heating is ceased and the Erlenmeyer flask is removed from the heating mantle and allowed to cool at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) for 1 h. The Erlenmeyer flask is then transferred to an ice bath for an additional 3 h to drive crystallization. The crystalline solid is collected by vacuum filtration using a clamped 500 mL filter flask and a 10.5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel lined with a 90 mm Whatman qualitative filter paper. The residual crystallized product is rinsed from the 2L flask with chloroform (2 x 25 mL). The product is transferred to a tared 500 mL, single-necked, 24/40 round-bottomed flask, and the residual solvent is removed under vacuum (1.40 mmHg) for 12 h to afford compound 2 (38.1 g, 67% yield, 97.1% purity) as off-white plates (Figure 2) (Notes 10 and 11).\nFigure 2.

The flask is clamped into an aluminum block and the gaps between the flask and block are filled with sand. A thermometer with adaptor is fitted into the left neck (Note 12), a 10-cm wide plastic powder funnel is placed in the middle neck, and a septum on the remaining neck (Figure3).\nFigure 3. Reaction setup for step B\nCompound 2 (38.1 g, 0.237 mol, 1 equiv) is added to the flask through the powder funnel, followed by de-ionized water (286 mL), and the resulting mixture is stirred under ambient atmosphere and temperature (23 \u00b0C) at 500 rpm. Zinc powder (31.1 g, 0.476 mol, 2 equiv) (Note 13) is slowly added to the opaque heterogeneous solution through the powder funnel over 30 min. The rate of zinc powder addition is adjusted to ensure the internal temperature does not rise above 40 \u00b0C. After addition of the zinc is complete, the reaction mixture becomes a light gray heterogeneous solution (Figure 4A). The powder funnel is removed and replaced by a 125 mL addition funnel which is then charge with 12 M hydrochloric acid (60 mL, 0.71 mol, 3 equiv) (Note 14). The addition funnel is left uncapped and the septum on the right neck is removed. The HCl is added to the reaction dropwise over 30 min, during which time the internal temperature increases to 60 \u00b0C (Figure 4B). After complete addition of hydrochloric acid, TLC analysis reveals the absence of starting material and the formation of a new spot (Figure 5A) (Note 15).\nFigure 4. A) After addition of zinc powder; B) During addition of hydrochloric acid\nFigure 5. A) TLC analysis of compound 3 after addition of 12 M HCl; B) Hot filtration setup for step B\nAt this point the reaction mixture is heated to 63 \u00b0C and held at this temperature for 1h. During the heating process the solution takes on an amber color and all solids dissolve into the aqueous solution (Note 16). Heating and stirring are then halted and the reaction flask is removed from the aluminum block. After 2 min of standing at 23 \u00b0C, the addition funnel is removed and the hot solution is filtered into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask using a 10-cm diameter glass powder funnel and folded 24-cm Whatman qualitative filter paper (Figure 5B). After standing for 3 h under ambient conditions (23 \u00b0C), the flask containing the filtrate is cooled on an ice bath for an additional 3 h to drive crystallization (Figure 6A). The crystalline solid is collected by vacuum filtration using a 500 mL filter flask equipped with a 10.5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel lined with a 90 mm Whatman qualitative filter paper. The crystalline solid is washed with chilled isopropyl alcohol (0 \u00b0C) (2 x 50 mL) (Note 6).

Compound 3 (5.00 g, 0.0397 mol, 1 equiv) (Note 19) is transferred to the flask through a glass powder funnel and dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) (Note 20). Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (6.50 mL, 0.06 mol, 1.5equiv) (Note 21) is carefully transferred to the flask by syringe. The round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser (Figure 7A) and heated to reflux using an aluminum block with sand while stirring (800 rpm) under ambient atmosphere. After 1 h of heating, the resulting yellow solution is removed from the aluminum block and allowed to cool for 40 min (Figure 7B) (Note 22).\nFigure 7. A) Reaction setup for step C; B) Completed reaction cooling to ambient temperature\nAfter cooling to ambient temperature, the dichloromethane is removed in vacuo using a rotary evaporator (Note 23) to obtain a yellow oil. Crystallization can be initiated by blowing air over the top of the derived oil. Once an appreciable amount of crystallization occurs residual solvent is removed by placing the flask under high vacuum for 40 min (1.40 mmHg), during which time the orange color fades to yield a white/orange solid (cf., Figures 8A and 8B) (Note 24). The crystalline solid is removed from the round-bottomed flask with a spatula and collected by vacuum filtration using a 500 mL filter flask equipped with a 6.5-cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel lined with a 55-mm Whatman qualitative filter paper.

            "The wide applications of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in constructing C-C bond have created an increasing demand for arylboronic acids or arylboronates.2 The traditional synthetic route of arylboronic acids relied on the trapping of organolithium or Grignard reagents with a trialkyl borate, followed by acidic hydrolysis.3 In 1995, Miyaura et al. developed the palladium-catalyzed borylation of arylhalides with bis(pinacolato)diboron, representing another important approach toward arylboronates.4 Direct borylation via aromatic C\u2212H bond activation has been extensively explored in the recent decades.5 Following our report in 2010,6 a series of similar Sandmeyer-type borylation reactions under modified conditions appeared in the literature.7 These recent advances are the focus of this Discussion Addendum.\nIn 2010, our group developed the metal-free direct conversion of aryl amines 1 to arylboronates 3.6 Using B2pin2 2 as the boron source, the reaction is promoted by the radical initiator dibenzoyl peroxide (BPO), and it is complete at room temperature within 1-2 h. As shown in Scheme 1, aryl amines 1 bearing various functionalities can be engaged in this transformation, and the corresponding borylation products are obtained in moderate to good yields; however, for heteroaromatic amines and some ortho-substituted aryl amines, the reaction only gives trace amount of the products.\nScheme 1.

To a 250-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a 4.0-cm football-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar is charged pyronin Y (7.40 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) and sodium phosphate tribasic dodecahydrate (18.6 g, 48.8 mmol, 2.00 equiv) (Note 3). To the round-bottomed flask, N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 150 mL) is added via graduated cylinder and water (5.00 mL, 278 mmol, 11.4 equiv) via syringe (Note 4). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum and temperature probe (Figure 1A). The flask is placed into a preheated silicon oil bath at 110 \u00baC and the stir rate is set to 650 rpm. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 h at this temperature, and the conversion can be monitored by TLC (Note 5). After 2 h, the flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C over 15 min. During the course of the first 2 h, the starting material is converted to a 1:1 mixture of product 1 and a non-fluorescent by-product, giving a brown solution (Figure 1B). Iodine (6.20 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 6) and sodium phosphate (9.30 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.00 equiv) are charged to the flask in single addition. An additional portion of water (2.00 mL, 111 mmol, 4.55 equiv) is added by syringe and the flask is fitted with a rubber septum and placed in a 110 \u00baC silicon oil bath and stirred overnight. Introduction of iodine to the solution results in a color change to a purple solution (Figure 1C) (Note 7). After stirring for 16 h at 110 \u00baC following iodine addition, the reaction is complete.\nFigure 1. Color change from A (start) to B (2 hours) to C (iodine added)\nAfter cooling to 23 \u00baC, the crude reaction mixture is filtered through a pad of celite (Note 8) into a 1-L round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint). The celite is washed with methylene chloride (400 mL) (Note 9) followed by methanol (200 mL) (Note 10) until no blue fluorescent product is visible (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Wash celite to remove fluorescent product (A), after washing (B)\nThe reaction is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (400 mmHg down to 100 mmHg, 40 \u00baC) for the bulk of the solvent removal. NMP is removed by vacuum distillation while the flask is stirred at 650 rpm (Note 11). The flask is heated to 70 \u00baC and stirred over 30 min while the pressure is gradually lowered (250 - 50 mmHg). The pressure is subsequently reduced to 1 mmHg and the reaction is stirred and further heated to 85 \u00baC. Distillation is aided by periodic heating with a heat gun and additional dry ice is packed around the collection flask. The majority of the NMP is removed after 1.5 h and the distillation is halted, affording a dark purple oil. Following the reaction, the product exists in an approximately 17:3 ratio of 1 to the de-methylated side product (Notes 12 and 13).\nTo convert the side product back to 1, the crude purple oil is dissolved in 150 mL methanol, methylene chloride, and acetic acid (8:1:1, v:v:v) (Note 14) and transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a 4.0-cm football-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. To the flask, 37% formaldehyde solution (0.91 mL, 12 mmol, 0.50 equiv) (Note 15) is added by syringe and the reaction is stirred (650 rpm) at 23 \u00baC for 1 h. Sodium cyanoborohydride (0.767 g, 12.2 mmol, 0.50 equiv) (Note 16) is charged to the flask and stirred for 3 h, where the reaction is deemed complete by LCMS or TLC (Note 17). The reaction is concentrated under reduced pressure (400 mmHg to 100 mmHg, 40 \u00baC). To the round-bottomed flask, water (200 mL) and methylene chloride (200 mL) are added. While stirring at 650 rpm, potassium carbonate (15 g) (Note 18) is slowly added to minimize gas evolution, and the final pH is 9-10 (Note 19). The solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and separated. The aqueous layer is further extracted with methylene chloride (3 x 100 mL). A further 100 mL of methylene chloride is used in rinsing residual product from the glassware used for extraction. The organic extracts are combined and washed with water (2 x 250 mL) and brine (1 x 200 mL, which was further diluted until the layers separated) (Note 20). The organic layer is split into two equal portions and each dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (75 g) (Notes 21 and 22). The sodium sulfate is removed by filtration through a fritted filter (Note 8) into a 1-L round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) and a portion of methanol (200 mL) is added. To the solution, silica gel (75 g) (Note 23) is added. The solution is concentrated under vacuum (400 mmHg to 50 mmHg, 40 \u00baC) on a rotary evaporator and then under high-vacuum (Note 24). The silica gel-adsorbed product is then loaded onto a packed chromatography column (Note 25) and purified (Note 26) to give 3.65 g (53%) of 3,6-bis(dimethylamino)-9H-xanthen-9-one (1) (Notes 27, 28, and 29)."

Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) (200 g) (Note 2) is ground to a course powder (Figure 1) in a mortar (\u03c6: 200 mm) and pestle (203 mm) and placed in a 500 mL beaker. A diluted solution of sulfuric acid (2.50 g, 25.5 mmol) in methanol (15 mL) (Note 3) is added at ambient temperature (22 \u00b0C) and the powder is mixed using a large spatula (18 cm) to distribute the acid into the powdered PEG and allowing most of the methanol to evaporate. Cellulose powder (50 g, 308 mmol of monomer) (Note 4) is added and the powders combined by stirring with the spatula for three minutes giving an intimate mixture of PEG/acid and cellulose powders (Figure 2). The powder mixture is transferred using a large powder funnel into a 1 L three-necked, round-bottomed flask. The left neck is equipped with a distillation head with the water-cooled Liebig condenser and 100 mL receiver flask. The center neck is equipped with a 29/32 cap, and the right neck is equipped with a thermocouple inserted through a 15/25 rubber septum (Figure 3). Two traps are connected to distillation setup. The first one is 100 mL two-necked flask and the second trap is a cold-finger. Each trap is cooled to -78 \u00b0C using a dry ice/methanol bath.\nFigure 1. Ground PEG 4000\nFigure 2. Diluted H2SO4 being added to PEG (left) and appearance of the PEG/acid/cellulose mixture (right)\nFigure 3. Pyrolysis setup (top), and cold traps (bottom left: 1st trap, bottom right: 2nd trap).\nThe setup is evacuated using a rotary-vane oil pump to less than 1.0 mmHg and the mixture heated over 15 min to 170 \u00b0C by mantle heater (Note 5). During this time the solid PEG/cellulose mixture melts, the colorless solution begins to char and turn black. When the solution reaches 170 \u00b0C the pressure is 3 mmHg, formation of a pale yellow distillate is observed and the distillate begins to collect in the receiver flask. A heat gun is used to warm the distillation head to assist distillation of the LGO and to avoid reflux of the mixture. Heating is continued and the temperature is kept between 180-190 \u00b0C for 30 min at which point no more product distills (Note 6). Upon completion of the distillation, a pale yellow liquid (29.8-31.0 g) is obtained, which contains mainly LGO, furfural and water (Figure 4) (Note 7).\nFigure 4. Appearance of the PEG and charred cellulose (left) and the distillate obtained (right)\nThe entire procedure is repeated and the distillates from the two independent reactions are combined. In total, 100 g of cellulose is pyrolyzed (Note 8). Ethyl acetate (60 mL) (Note 9) is added to the distillate at ambient temperature (22 \u00b0C) followed by solid NaHCO3 (5 g) (Note 10) and a 3.1 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar. The reaction is allowed to stir for 15 min to facilitate evolution of CO2 gas. The mixture is transferred to a 100 mL separating funnel and the flask is washed with ethyl acetate (5 mL), which is added to the separatory funnel. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with an additional portion of ethyl acetate (60 mL) (Figure 5) (Notes 9 and 11).

After about 15 min the solids are completely dissolved, and triethylamine (37 mL, 264 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 2) is added dropwise over 10 min (Note 4). In a separate 250-mL one-necked flask equipped with a septum and a needle to allow a nitrogen atmosphere, diphenylphosphinic chloride (40.4 mL, 50.0 g, 211 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2) is mixed in dichloromethane (50 mL) under nitrogen using gentle shaking for about 1 min.

Per\u00adhaps due to difficulties associated with earlier syntheses, dbcot chemistry received wider attention only after 2002, when Wudl et al.5 reported a con\u00adve\u00adnient synthesis, which was some\u00adwhat improved by our group.\nThis discussion addendum is focused on uses of dbcot and a few deri\u00advatives in catalysis. Useful procedures for prepa\u00adra\u00adtion of these compounds are also outlined. Fun\u00adda\u00admental metalorganic and coordination che\u00admistry of dbcot have been reviewed recent\u00adly (2019)6 and are here only dis\u00adcus\u00adsed in conjunction with cata\u00adlysis.\n\nPreparation of Dbcot and Dbcot Derivatives\nThe procedures currently in use are all based on Wudl's work. The route to dbcot, as streamlined by us, has been used by several groups without problems. Nevertheless, members of one of the groups expressed concern about the lachrymatory effect of a,a'-dibromo-o-xylene and the use of carbon tetrachloride as solvent in the bromination step.7\nWudl's work was also directed at the diyne 7 and included a ring enlar\u00adgement of the commercially available dibenzosuberone (4) with trimethylsi\u00adlyldiazomethane to give the ketone 5 (70%) (Scheme 1).5 This ketone was used by Chen and Hartwig for the development of a second route to dbcot by adding a Shapiro reaction via the hydazone 6 to give dbcot (1) in 83% yield (Scheme 1).8\nScheme 1. A second practical route to dbcot (1)\nGr\u00fctzmacher et al.9 prepared a series of 5-aryl-dbcot derivatives from the ketone 5 in two simple steps (Scheme 2) and used them as ligands of transition metal catalysts. A chiral Rh-complex of 9a, obtained by resolution, gave promising results in an enantioselective Hayashi-Miyaura reaction. While the Rh-complex was stable against racemization, the free ligand (R)-9a underwent complete racemization by tub to tub interconversion within > 3 h at room temperature.\nScheme 2. A route to monoaryl substituted dbcot derivatives 9\nStrand et al.10 advanced the topic of asymmetric catalysis by using C2-symmetric derivatives 12 of dbcot (Scheme 3). Their synthesis commenced with the dibromide 2, which was transformed into the dione 10 according to a known procedure (Kornblum oxidation),11 which proceeded in good yield but required two equivalents of silver tosylate. The dione 10 was trans\u00adformed into the bis-triflate 11 by treatment with Tf2O. Finally, cross coup\u00adling using an Fe- and a Pd-catalyst, furnished 5,11-methyl- (12a) and 5,11-phenyl-dbcot (12b), respectively. Enantiomers of both 12a and 12b could be separated by semi-preparative chiral column chromatography. The enantiomers equilibrate by tub to tub isomerization with a barrier of \u00bb 30 kcal/mol; accordingly, racemization at room temperature is slow.\nThe benzologue 16 (dncot) of dbcot was already prepared in 1990 in low yield.12 A convenient high yield route was developed by Wender et al. (Scheme 4).13 a,a'-Dibromo-o-xylene served as starting material; the reaction with ethynyltrimethysilane furnished the dialkyne 13 in almost quantitative yield. Subsequent deprotection to give 14 was carried out in excellent yield with 3 equivalents of silver cyanide. In the meantime, catalytic methods (10 mol% of AgNO3) have been developed14 that likely would allow simpli\u00adfication of the deprotection step. Nickel-catalyzed [2+2+2+2]-cycloaddition to give 15 followed by oxidation furnished crystalline dncot (16) in high overall yield. Addition of bromine followed by base-promoted elimination gave the bromide 17. This allowed preparation of a variety of further de\u00adrivatives 18 of dncot by substitution or cross coupling reactions.\nScheme 3. Preparation of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives 12\nScheme 4. Preparation of dncot (15) according to Wender\n\nUses in Catalysis\n\nRhodium-Catalyzed 1,4- and 1,2-Additions of Arylboronic Acids\nInterest in dbcot as a constituent of catalysts rather than as an inhibitor, cf the Crabtree test, began after Hayashi and Carreira in 2003 introduced chi\u00adral dienes 19 and 20, respectively, as ligands of Rh-catalysts of the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction (Figure 1) 15,16a and an Ir-catalyzed kinetic resolution allylic substitution.16b\nRh-Complexes of dienes such as cod, 19 and 20 are not very stable. This observation induced Gr\u00fctzmacher et al. (2005)9 to employ Rh-complexes of the dbcot derivatives 9 as catalysts. The complex (R)-21b furnished excellent yield and modest but promising enantioselectivity for the 1,4-addition of phenylboronic acid to cyclohexen-2-one (Scheme 5).\nFigure 1. Chiral diene ligands and complexes\nScheme 5. Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\nFollowing the rule that C2-symmetry is an advantageous property of a chiral ligand, Strand and co-workers prepared the enantiomerically pure Rh-complexes (S,S)-22a and -22b (Figure 1) from the ligands 12a and 12b, respectively.10 With these, the expected high enantioselectivities were indeed ob\u00adtained with cyclic as well as acyclic enones and enoates (Scheme 6). In ad\u00addition, highly enantioselective 1,2-additions of arylboronic acids to a-keto\u00adesters were realized by the Strand group.10\nScheme 6. Use of C2-symmetric dbcot derivatives in the Hayashi-Miyaura reaction\n\nIridium-Catalyzed Allylic Substitutions\nThe Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution was introduced in 1997 and found immediate interest because of preference for the branched, chiral substitution product.17 Continuous development has led to two very robust and highly regioselective as well as enantioselective versions (type I, Scheme 7,18 and type II19)20 with many applications in the area of biologically active com\u00adpounds.21 Both versions rely on catalysts prepared from the complex [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and a chiral phosphine. Earlier on it was not clear, whether cod was incorporated into the active catalyst. It turned out that cod is preserved in type I and lost in type II substitutions. This finding was an incentive to explore dbcot-derived catalysts in type I substitutions.\nScheme 7. Ir-catalyzed enantioselective allylic substitutions of type I\nThere are several improvements to be gained by using dbcot-complexes in type I allylic substitutions: (a) Dbcot-Ir-complexes display enhanced ther\u00admal stability, because dbcot is stronger bound to IrI than cod. (b) Reactions with cod-complexes as catalysts require strict exclusion of oxygen. In stark contrast, the corresponding reactions with dbcot-complexes can be run under air and with aqueous solvents. (c) With cod, reactions often display unsatis\u00adfactory regioselectivity in case of aliphatic substituents R. With dbcot im\u00adprovement is gained because of its enhanced electron acceptor capacity.\nAn interesting example illustrating point (a) is due to Han et al. (Scheme 8).22 This (Tsuji) reaction involves a decarboxylative allylic substitution as the key step. With cod as an ancillary ligand, the reaction did not proceed up to a temperature of 85 \u00b0C and a reaction time of 24 h, presumably because of decomposition of the catalyst. A highly selective reaction occurred with the corresponding dbcot derived catalyst at 60 \u00b0C within 6 h.\nScheme 8. Tsuji-type decarboxylative allylic etherification\nPoint (b), stability of the catalyst against air and water, is illustrated by Scheme 9.23 Previous attempts to accomplish an allylic hydroxylation using cod containing Ir-complexes failed in our and another laboratory.24 With dbcot as an ancillary ligand and bicarbonate as a nucleophile, the reaction could be performed with excellent results. The requisite Ir-complexes were obtained in a very convenient way as described in Scheme 10.25\nScheme 9. Enantioselective allylic hydroxylation\nScheme 10. One pot preparation of (allyl)Ir complexes\nTosatti et al. needed to employ similarly polar (DMSO) and aerobic con\u00additions in the development of an array of drug lead-like highly polar amino acid derivatives.26,27 Use of cod as ancillary ligand furnished yields below 5%. With dbcot excellent yields of the branched (exclusively) products were obtained (Scheme 11). Peters, et al. used the similarly polar solvent dimethylformamide in combination with the complex 24 successfully for a sequential allylic substitution/aza-Cope rearrangement process.28\nScheme 11. Aerobic allylic substitutions with highly polar amines in DMSO as a solvent\nImprovement of regioselectivity, i. e. point (c) above, is another incentive for the replacement of cod by dbcot or dncot. Results, taken from reference 29 for cod/dbcot and reference 30 for dncot, are presented in Figure 2.29,30 It is apparent that the latter ligands induce improved regioselectivity in favor of the branched products; this is likely due to their enhanced electron withdrawing capacity in comparison to that of cod. The (R)-enantiomer of the final product in Figure 2 was required as starting material for total syntheses of the natural products (+)-crypt- and (+)-infectocaryone.31 Many further examples concerning the influence of dbcot on regioselectivity have been reported by the You group.32\nFigure 2. Results of reactions according to Scheme 7 using various diene ligands (ligand L2)\n\nMiscellaneous reactions\nSince 1995 Wender et al. have developed syntheses of cycloheptane derivatives via intra- and intermolecular Rh-catalyzed [5+2] cycloaddition reac\u00adtions.33 Over the years progress with respect to reactivity and regioselec\u00adtivity was achieved by introducing new Rh-catalysts. Currently three catalysts are being used of which one contains dncot as a ligand (Scheme 12). The crucial problems for the intermolecular reaction are regioselectivity and rate (Figure 3).13 The dncot-complex excelled particularly with respect to regioselectivity. The influence of the ligand was elucidated by dft calculations.34\nFigure 3. Catalysts used in [5+2] cycloaddition reactions\nScheme 12. [5+2] Cycloaddition reactions according to Wender et al. (DCE: 1,2-dichlorethane, TFE: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol)\nZhang et al. have studied polymerization of phenylacetylenes with Rh-cod as well as Rh-dbcot-complexes as catalysts (Scheme 13).35 Once more dbcot-complexes, such as 21a, excelled, displaying higher stability and acti\u00advity than cod-complexes due to stronger Lewis acidity caused by the high \u03c0-acidity of dbcot. Thus, on water polymerization under aerobic conditions became feasible. Facile recovery and re-use of the catalysts was possible due to their water-solubility.\nScheme 13. Use of a dbcot-complex as polymerization catalyst\nFinally, Gr\u00fctzmacher et al.36 have developed the Ru-catalyst 26, which is a hydrogenase mimic in that it is able to both catalytically split and produce H2 by stepwise release of electrons and protons (Scheme 14). Turnover num\u00adbers up to 252 were found for the hydrogenation of vitamin K3; the quinoid moiety, rather than a double bond, was selectivity hydrogenated in the case of vitamin K2.\nScheme 14. Hydrogenase mimic devised by Gr\u00fctzmacher et al."

            "The protocol for the synthesis of (R)- and (S)- 2-allylcyclohexanone had been chosen for demonstrating that preformed, non-stabilized lithium enolates are suitable nucleophiles for palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylations - the so-called Tsuji-Trost reaction.2 This method is a direct alternative to the intramolecular variant, the decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation that starts from allyl \u03b2-ketoesters or allyl enol carbonates. This intramolecular approach, which was pioneered by the research groups of Stoltz, Trost and others,3 has been published as an Organic Syntheses procedure on (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone in 2009.4 This manuscript was followed by an addendum in 2018.5 In both procedures, advantage was taken of the cyclohexanone skeleton that guaranteed the fixed trans-configuration of the lithium enolate.\nThis discussion addendum emphasizes the progress and development of transition metal-catalyzed allylic alkylations for enantioselective and diastereoselective carbon-carbon bond formations by using preformed lithium enolates of various carbonyl and carboxyl derivatives.\nAfter a diastereoselective and enantioselective allylation of mesityl ethyl ketone had been reported by us,2b the group of Hou studied the allylation of various acyclic ketones through their lithium enolates.6 In a remarkable extension of their protocol, they used acylsilanes 1 as substrates and obtained allylation products 3 in high diastereoselectivity with excellent optical purity. The alkenes 3 are particularly valuable as they can be converted into carboxylic acids and esters, so that the protocol can be considered as an alternative to the allylation of ester enolates. In this palladium-mediated reaction, ferrocenyloxazoline ligand 2 served as the efficient, stereoselectivity-determining ligand (Scheme 1).7\nScheme 1. Diastereoselective and enantioselective allylic alkylation of acylsilanes\nMore recently, Hou's group reported the palladium-catalyzed reaction of gem-alkyl-aryl-disubstituted allylic reagents with cyclic ketones through their lithium enolates. Remarkably, the branched products featuring a quaternary stereogenic center not only formed regioselectivity at the expense of the linear regioisomer, but also diastereoselectively.8\nRhodium-catalysis turned out to be the suitable tool for the enantioselective allylic alkylation of \u03b1-oxy-substituted ketones 4, as demonstrated by Evans and coworkers. In this procedure, the monodentate phosphite ligand 6 was used, and allylation products 7 were obtained in fair to high enantioselectivity. A chelated structure 5 of the lithium enolate was postulated (Scheme 2).9 Later, Hartwig and coworkers reported diastereoselective and enantioselective iridium-catalyzed allylic alkylations of \u03b1-alkoxy-ketones. Their primarily generated lithium enolates were transmetalated into the copper enolates that are assumed to adopt a five-membered chelate structure.10a Recently, Trost and coworkers achieved an enantioselective allylation of 1,3-dioxaboroles, a special kind of boron enolates that serves as synthetic equivalent of \u03b1-hydroxyketones.10b\nScheme 2. Asymmetric rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of \u03b1-oxy-substituted ketones\nBy also using rhodium catalysis in combination with (R)-configured ligand 6, Evans and Wright achieved the allylation of aldehyde enolates for the creation of a stereogenic quaternary center in \u03b1-carbonyl position. It turned out that the particular lithium amide base used for deprotonation was crucial for the enantioselectivity. LiHMDS provided the highest ee-values. For obtaining satisfying chemical yields, the presence of the co-solvent DMPU was necessary, and the lithium base had to added dropwise - obviously for suppression of undesired side-reactions. (Scheme 3).11 Surprisingly, the same enantiomer of alkenes 7 is formed, irrespective of the configuration of the lithium enolate.\nScheme 3. Racemic \u03b1-aryl aldehydes allylated by rhodium catalysis through their lithium enolates\nAfter the asymmetric allylic alkylation of ketone enolates had been achieved, the group of Hou studied the extension to acyclic tertiary amides, whose lithium enolates are known to be as equally stable as ketone enolates. The method is illustrated in Scheme 4 for N,N-diphenyl carboxylic amides 10 that are deprotonated with LiHMDS and subsequently submitted to a palladium-catalyzed reaction with allylic phosphates 12. The allylic alkylation was mediated by the commercially available MeO-BIPHEP-type ligand 11 and delivered amides 13, whose ee-values ranged from 83 to 93%.12\nScheme 4. Asymmetric allylic alkylation of amides 10 through their lithium enolates; Ar = 3,4,5-(MeO)3C6H2\nThis disclosure was preceded by an asymmetric allylic alkylation of racemic \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted acyclic amides with similar degrees of enantioselectivity.13 Previously, Trost and Frederiksen had reported that 3-aryl-substituted oxindoles can be allylated in an enantioselective manner through their lithium enolates.14\nWhile the asymmetric allylic alkylation of amide enolates was elaborated, as outlined above, our research group next tackled a further class of non-stabilized lithium enolates: deprotonated lactones. For this purpose, we applied conditions very similar to those used in the original Organic Syntheses procedure, and used, in particular, lithium chloride as an additive in the asymmetric allylation of \u03b4-valerolactone (Scheme 5).\nScheme 5. Enantioselective and diastereoselective allylic alkylations of \u03b4-valerolactone through the lithium enolate\nThe simple, readily available, classic BINAP ligand provided fair enantioselectivity in the formation of alkene 15 in the palladium-catalyzed reaction with allyl methyl carbonate. High enantioselectivity, combined with high diastereoselectivity was reached in the formation of lactones 16 and ent-16 depending on the enantiomer of the chiral ligand BINAP. Thus, enantiomeric products 16 featuring contiguous stereogenic centers were obtained starting from racemic dimethylallyl carbonate 14.15\nWhen enantiomerically pure \u03b4-caprolactone (R)-17 was submitted to this allylation protocol using either (R)- or (S)-BINAP as the chiral ligand at palladium, the stereochemical outcome was clearly determined by the configuration of the catalyst. This protocol facilitated formation of diastereomeric products 18 and 19, both as pure enantiomers (Scheme 6).15\nScheme 6. Catalyst-control in the allylic alkylation of (R)-\u03b4-caprolactone\nMore fragile and sensitive than enolates of ketones, aldehydes, amides, lactams and lactones are lithium enolates of carboxylic esters that are thermally labile and tend to decompose under formation of ketene and alkoxide. So far, only chelated zinc or titanium enolates derived from \u03b1-amino acids or peptides proved themselves as versatile and suitable for enantioselective and/or diastereoselective Tsuji-Trost reactions.16 Our group however, tackled the direct enantioselective allylic alkylation of non-chelated enolates of simple alkanoic-acid esters 20. Prerequisite of that achievement was the selective generation of either cis- or trans-configured lithium enolates that was enabled by following the seminal contributions of Ireland and coworkers.17 For this purpose, carboxylic esters 20 were deprotonated with LDA for generating trans-configured lithium enolates 21. As in previous protocols, the presence of lithium chloride was found to be crucial for reactivity and stereoselectivity. However, instead of adding the salt in stoichiometric amounts, we used allylic chloride that forms lithium chloride gradually as the palladium-catalyzed allylation proceeds. Mediating the reaction with C3-TUNEPHOS ligand (R)-22 led to allylated esters 23 in fair to high yield and enantioselectivity up to 91 % ee . (Scheme 7).18\nScheme 7. Enantioselective allylic alkylation of alkanoic ester enolates\nIn our attempts to extend even further the Tsuji-Trost-reaction towards \"harder\" nucleophiles, we finally investigated doubly deprotonated carboxylic acids - truly hard enolates if one takes into account that the pKa value of acetate was determined to amount to 33.5.19 Dilithiated carboxylic acids R2C=C(OLi)2 had been disclosed by Creger;20a,b procedures for a more convenient generation were elaborated later by the groups of Mulzer20c and Parra.20d After having shown that carboxylic-acid dianions can indeed serve as nucleophiles in Tsuji-Trost reactions,21 we studied the challenging allylic alkylation of doubly lithiated acetic acid - probably a highly aggregated species, whose mixture in THF has a milky consistence, expected to react sluggishly. After generation of doubly lithiated acetic acid 24, a protocol similar to that described above for the allylation of carboxylic esters was applied. Thus, racemic dimethylallyl chloride 25 was used as allylation reagent and, simultaneously, as a source of lithium chloride. Again, TUNEPHOS ligand 22 was used. Under a remarkably low catalyst-loading, 3-methyl-4-hexenoic acid 26 was obtained in 88% ee (Scheme 8).2i The enantioselective allylic alkylation through doubly deprotonated carboxylic acids may be considered a direct alternative to the traditional Tsuji-Trost protocols that starts from malonates and uses the detour via saponification and decarboxylation of the allylation products to alkenyl monocarboxylic acids.\nNitriles are considered to be a derivative of carboxylic acids in the broader sense. Upon deprotonation, \u03b1-substituted benzyl nitriles form azaallenyl anions that were submitted to enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation - a protocol that leads to nitriles featuring a quaternary stereogenic center.22\nScheme 8. Enantioselective allylic alkylation of doubly deprotonated acetic acid\nConcerning the stereochemistry of the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation, two different pathways are discussed, as shown in Scheme 9: Both start with the intermediate \u03a0-allyl palladium complex 28 that forms from the racemic precursor 27 under inversion of configuration. Then, the outer-sphere mechanism postulates the nucleophile to approach from the face opposite to that occupied by the noble metal under formation of product 29. According to the inner-sphere mechanism a pre-coordination of the nucleophile to palladium occurs to give intermediate 30 and, subsequently, the nucleophile approaches the allyl complex from the same face as the palladium is located, and the carbon-nucleophile bond forms under reductive elimination. As a stereochemical consequence, the outer-sphere mechanism leads to a net retention (product 29), whereas the inner-sphere path results in net inversion (product ent-29) (Scheme 9). Early studies of the Tsuji-Trost reaction had revealed that \"soft\" carbon nucleophiles favor the outer-sphere mechanism, whereas \"hard\" carbon nucleophiles follow the inner-sphere mechanism, where a pKa value of approximately 20 to 25 was considered - somewhat arbitrarily - the border between \"hard\" and \"soft\" nucleophiles.23 In this context the lithium enolates derived from the carbonyl and carboxyl compounds discussed here are borderline cases.\nScheme 9. Competing mechanisms in the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation and their stereochemical outcome\nIn a first study, we used the diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure allylic acetate (Z)-31 as a probe that was submitted to the palladium-catalyzed reaction with the lithium enolate of acetophenone according to our standard allylation procedure; however, achiral ligand dppf [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] was used and the stereocontrol was dependent on the substrate. By means of this experiment, we tried to find out whether preformed lithium enolates follow the pathway of \"soft\" or \"hard\" nucleophiles. The reaction led to ketone 32 as a single diastereomer - a result that is significant in two ways: the new carbon-carbon bond had formed under overall inversion of the configuration, and the double bond has isomerized from (Z)-31 to (E)-32. This stereochemical outcome is explained as follows: Firstly, the acetate leaving group in the starting material 31 is displaced by the noble metal under inversion. The intermediate \u03c0-allyl complex 33a thus formed undergoes a conversion into the thermodynamically favored \u03c0-allyl complex 33b through \u03c0-\u03c3-\u03c0-interconversions involving the \u03c3-complex 34a and its rotamer 34b. Finally, the lithium enolate attacks the \u03c0-allyl complex 33b from the face opposite to the palladium. Thus, the observed overall inversion en-route from (Z)-31 to (E)-32 results from two substitutions each under inversion and the (Z)-(E)-double-bond isomerization (Scheme 10).2f\nScheme 10. Palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of the probe (31). Evidence for the outer-sphere mechanism\nThe analogous stereochemical result was also observed with the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone. The mechanism proposed in Scheme 10 is furthermore supported by the fact that the (E)-diastereomer of alkene 31 reacts under overall retention when submitted to the palladium-mediated reaction with the lithium enolate of acetophenone. Clearly, the stereochemical result of these conversions supports the outer-sphere mechanism. In an earlier study,24 we had submitted the acetate (Z)-31 to a palladium-bis(diphenylphosphinomethane)-mediated reaction with malonate - a typical \"soft\" carbon nucleophile. The stereochemical result was the same as with the preformed enolates of acetophenone and cyclohexanone: Overall inversion under double bond isomerization.\nThese results were confirmed by a study of Trost, Xu, and Schmidt, who used the cyclic acetate rac-cis-35 as a probe. The latter was submitted to an allylic alkylation with the lithium enolate of 2-methyltetralone. The reaction that was mediated by \"Trost's ligand\" (R,R)-36 led to diastereomerically pure ketone 37 in 87% ee. Here again, the net retention in the allylic moiety results from a double inversion - a further proof of the outer-sphere mechanism (Scheme 11).23b\nScheme 11. Evidence for the outer-sphere mechanism by palladium-catalyzed allylation of 2-methyltetralone enolate with the probe rac-34\nFor obtaining a deeper insight into the mechanism of asymmetric allylic alkylations with preformed lithium enolates, Thiel and Patil performed theoretical calculations that are based on the results obtained by our group with (R)-\u03b3-valerolactone 38. This enantiomerically pure compound was submitted to our allylation protocol in the presence of lithium chloride using (R)- and (S)-BINAP as chiral ligands at the palladium. We noticed a clear mismatched combination in the reaction with (R)-BINAP resulting in a 56:44-ratio of diastereomeric products 39 and 40 (Table 1, entry 1). The matched combination of (R)-lactone 38 with (S)-BINAP, on the other hand, led to a high preference for the trans-diastereomer 39 over cis-40 (entry 2).15\nTable 1. Experimental and calculated diastereoselectivities of alkenes 39 and 40 obtained by allylic alkylation of (R)- \u03b3 -valerolactone 38\n*Calculated diastereomeric ratios obtained from the free energy differences of the two diastereomeric transition states, computed at the B3LYP-IV level\nDFT calculations at B3LYP-I to B3LYP-IV levels were performed based on these experimental data in order to study the mechanism, while a focus was put on the role of lithium chloride. Three structures were considered in the calculation for the enolate of \u03b3-valerolactone 38: the ion pair 41a with the negative charge delocalized, the O-bound tautomer 41b, and the mixed aggregate 41c with lithium chloride. On the other hand, the [(\u03b73-C3H5)Pd-(S)-BINAP] cation 42a as well as the complexes [(\u03b73-C3H5)PdCl-(S)-BINAP] (42b) and [\u03b71-C3H5)PdCl-(S)-BINAP] (42c) were taken into account as reactive palladium complexes. (Fig. 1).15,25\nFigure 1. Structures 41 and 42 considered in DFT calculations and calculated transition state for the allylic alkylation of lactone (R)-38 with palladium-(S)-BINAP\nBased upon these structures, five different pathways for the approach of the enolate to allyl palladium complex were calculated and the relevant transition states were located. The experimental outcome in the combination of lactone 38 with (S)-BINAP (Table 1, entry 2) exclusively matched with the permutation of the mixed aggregate 41c with the \u03b73-complex 42b wherein chloride is bound directly to palladium. Moreover, the transition state leading to trans-lactone 39 has the lowest free energy of all the transition states calculated.\nThe transition-state model 43 resulting from the calculations, also shown in Figure 1, clearly supports the outer-sphere mechanism. The approach of the enolate to the allyl moiety from the face opposite to the transition metal is facilitated by a \"tether\" consisting of chlorine bound at palladium and lithium of the Li-O-Li-Cl-square. The fact that experimental and calculated product ratios of trans-39:cis-40 also agree for the mismatched pair (R)-39 with (R)-BINAP (Table 1, entry 1) underlines the reliability of the theoretical calculations.15,25\nCompared to lithium enolates, silyl enol ethers and silyl ketene acetals that may be considered as silicon enolates are in general more stable and robust - at the expense, however, of diminished reactivity or even sluggishness. For being used in transition metal-catalyzed allylic alkylations, silyl enol ethers require an activation by fluoride. Protocols that provide high enantioselectivity were elaborated using palladium3b,26 or iridium27 catalysis. The more nucleophilic silyl ketene acetals that function as ester-enolate equivalents were used in asymmetric allylic alkylations partly without activation under palladium,28 copper,29 or iridium30,31 catalysis."

A 500-mL Erlenmeyer containing a magnetic stir bar (PTFE-coated, 140 mm x 10 mm, polygon-type) and a temperature probe is charged with sodium ascorbate (25.4 g, 125 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 2) and deionized water (180 mL), affording a pale-yellow solution (Figures 1A and 1B). The stirring is slowly increased until a stable vortex is established (Note 3). An initial temperature reading is taken and the probe is removed (Note 4) before freshly ground TEMPO (10.0 g, 62.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added in one portion (Figure 1C). The probe is reinserted and the red suspension is stirred vigorously at ambient temperature (Figure 1D). Once the red solids are fully converted to a white precipitate, and internal temperature no longer increases (ca. 15 min) (Notes 6 and 7) (Figure 1E), CH2Cl2 (100 mL) (Note 8) is added and stirring is continued for 10 min.\nFigure 1.

            "Transition-metal-catalyzed carbonylation using carbon monoxide (CO) has been recognized as a powerful tool for the installation of a carbonyl group.2,3,4 While CO gas is industrially used as an inexpensive chemical feedstock, its use is inevitably accompanied by safety requirements for conducting reactions with special caution and handling techniques because of its gaseous and toxic nature. Such disadvantages limit the use of CO gas, often rendering the catalytic carbonylation reaction impractical, especially on laboratory scale.\nOne promising strategy to avoid the use of CO gas is the development of CO surrogates.5,6,7,8,9 These are non-gaseous compounds that generate CO by chemical reactions or physical stimuli. Once CO is formed from CO surrogates inside a closed reaction vessel, it can be efficiently consumed by the carbonylation reactions. Thereby, exposure to CO gas can be avoided during the reactions. Since most CO surrogates are less toxic than CO gas, they are considered to be potentially safe and practical substitutes for CO gas for use in carbonylation reactions. It is also advantageous that CO surrogates can be weighed easily, compared with CO gas; this enables the use of near-stoichiometric amounts of CO surrogates.\nThe groups of Manabe10 and Tsuji11 independently developed aryl formates like phenyl formate (1) as a new type of CO surrogate suitable for the Pd-catalyzed external-CO-free aryloxycarbonylation of haloarenes (Scheme 1(a)). In this reaction, aryl formates play dual roles as sources of CO and nucleophilic phenols, where both compounds are efficiently incorporated into aryl esters. Later, our group discovered that 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2) and N-formylsaccharin (3) are stable but more reactive CO surrogates (Scheme 1(b)) for aryloxycarbonylation,12 reductive carbonylation,13 and fluorocarbonylation.14\nScheme 1. (a) Pd-catalyzed aryloxycarbonylation of haloarenes and (b) aryl formates and N-formylsaccharin as CO surrogates\nAt the time our procedure was published in Organic Syntheses (2014) describing the Pd-catalyzed external-CO-free carbonylation using 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate,15 aryl formates and N-formylsaccharin were increasingly applied as CO surrogates in various synthetic organic chemistry fields. In this Discussion Addendum, we describe the fundamental features of aryl formates and N-formylsaccharin, as well as the advances made in their chemistry as CO surrogates since our initial reports.10,12,13\nMerits of Aryl Formates and Mechanism of CO Generation\nSome aryl formates are commercially available, although at high prices. The alternative is to consider their in-house preparation, especially for planning syntheses on larger scale. Aryl formates are easily synthesized by the single-step formylation of the corresponding phenols. After mixing formic acid and acetic anhydride to form acetic formic anhydride at 60 \u00b0C, phenols and sodium acetate are added at room temperature to afford the desired aryl formates after aqueous work-up and recrystallization or distillation.15 Metal-catalyzed preparation methods have also been reported.16\nThe most striking feature of 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2) and N-formylsaccharin (3) compared to other CO surrogates is the mild reaction conditions required for CO generation. While conventional CO surrogates require harsh conditions like high temperature, a transition metal catalyst, and a strong acid/base, our CO surrogates 2 and 3 generate CO in the presence of a weak base like triethylamine within 30 min at room temperature, despite their highly crystalline and stable nature.12,13 Neither special apparatus nor the activation of the CO surrogates are required, providing a simple and convenient carbonylation setup. The mild reaction conditions contribute to the broadening of functional group compatibility and the suppression of undesired side reactions, which significantly increases the feasibility of the carbonylation process.\nOur mechanistic study of CO generation from phenyl formate (1) revealed that abstraction of formyl proton by a weak base like trialkylamine triggers the simultaneous formation of CO and phenoxide in a concerted bimolecular \u03b1-elimination fashion (Scheme 2).17 The base works catalytically, and the use of stronger bases or polar solvents accelerates the CO generation. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups into phenyl formate also enhances its reactivity, which rationalizes the higher reactivity of 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2) compared to that of 1. Importantly, the rate of CO generation can be actively controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions and changing the structure of the aryl formates. Indeed, we have succeeded in performing room-temperature carbonylation of iodoarenes using 1 that previously required a high temperature (80 \u00b0C) for CO generation.17\nScheme 2. Mechanism of CO generation from 1\nIt is noteworthy that a simple aqueous work-up is sufficient for removal of excess trichlorophenol in both the preparation and reaction of 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2). As mentioned in the original Organic Syntheses procedure,15 alkali washing enables the easy separation of the desired aryl esters from trichlorophenol, and this also applies for most aryl formates and N-formylsaccharin (3).\nSynthesis of Aryl Esters and Their Use in Synthetic Organic Chemistry\nIn the initial study on the catalytic aryloxycarbonylation using 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2), the reaction of iodoarenes proceeded smoothly at room temperature. However, bromoarenes required both a higher temperature (100 \u00b0C) and the slow addition of the solution of 2 (3 h). Recently, we improved the reaction conditions by replacing the slow addition technique for the reaction of bromoarenes (Scheme 3). While a high temperature (80 \u00b0C) was still required, probably due to the slower oxidative addition of bromoarenes to Pd(0) compared to that of iodoarenes, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 1 mol% without any loss of reactivity.18\nScheme 3. Catalytic aryloxycarbonylation of bromoarenes using 2\nBeller, Wu, and coworkers have reported that aryl formates act as both precursors of electrophiles and carbonylating agents (Scheme 4(a)).19 The reaction of aryl formate and triethylamine generates CO and phenoxide, and the latter reacts with perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride (NfF) to form a sulfonate electrophile, a substrate for catalytic aryloxycarbonylation. Some phenols were also applied for in-situ formation of aryl sulfonates that were carbonylated to afford phenyl esters, obviating the preparation of the sulfonate electrophiles (Scheme 4(b)).\nScheme 4. (a) Catalytic aryloxycarbonylation using aryl formate and NfF and (b) aryloxycarbonylation of phenol\nSince aryl esters, products of catalytic aryloxycarbonylation, are electronically activated toward a nucleophilic attack, various carbonyl compounds, such as esters, amides, and thioesters are obtained by the reaction with nucleophiles (Scheme 5). It is also feasible to perform the inter- or intramolecular nucleophilic substitution after the aryloxycarbonylation in a one-pot procedure. We demonstrated the latter synthetic strategy using phenyl formate (1) and haloarenes containing nucleophilic moieties to create cyclic carbonyl compounds (Scheme 6).20 It was confirmed that the corresponding phenyl ester is actually a reaction intermediate by quenching the reaction before completion. Likewise, several (hetero)cyclic carbonyl compounds were synthesized via the formation of phenyl esters.21,22,23\nScheme 5. Nucleophilic substitution of aryl esters\nScheme 6. Aryloxycarbonylation/intramolecular nucleophilic substitution for the synthesis of cyclic carbonyl compounds\nAnother important application of aryl esters involves their use as unconventional electrophiles in catalytic cross-coupling with organometallic partners (Scheme 7). More recently, the development of novel catalyst-ligand systems has advanced the capabilities of Pd- or Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl esters to enable the oxidative addition of an aryl ester to a metal center. Both carbonyl-retentive coupling 24,25,26,27,28,29 and decarbonylative coupling30,31,32,33,34 were reported, and some catalyst systems exhibited a switchable selectivity by choosing appropriate ligands.35,36 Therefore, two types of products, ketones and alkyl/aryl arenes, are directly accessible by cross-coupling of aryl esters.\nScheme 7. Catalytic cross-coupling of aryl esters\nSelected Applications of Aryl Formates and N-Formylsaccharin\nThe suitability of aryl esters for various syntheses and the favorable attributes of aryl formates and N-formylsaccharin have been corroborated by an increasing number of applications using them as CO surrogates. Installation of a one-carbon functional group using a CO surrogate is an attractive method by which to form activated aryl esters and acyl fluorides and subsequently to generate other carboxylic acid derivatives by nucleophilic substitution. Most examples shown below were successfully performed in reactions at hundreds of milligram to gram-scale, indicating the robustness and reliability of this carbonylation.\nOkamoto and coworkers used 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2) to synthesize functional molecules (Scheme 8).37 Two carbonyl moieties were introduced into dibromo compound 5 by carbonylation, which was further converted into an N-substituted benzo[c]thiophene diimide (Cy6-BTDI) that serves as an air-stable organic field-effect transistor.\nScheme 8. Synthesis of Cy6-BTDI utilizing CO surrogate 2\nDe Borggraeve, Alc\u00e1zar, and coworkers applied CO surrogates in continuous-flow carbonylation reactions (Scheme 9).38 Compound 2 was an optimal CO surrogate with respect to appropriate reactivity and solubility in organic solvents. This continuous-flow system could reduce the amount of 2 required for the reaction (from 2.0 to 1.3 equivalent) and was scaled up to synthesize 3 g of trichlorophenyl ester.\nScheme 9. Continuous-flow carbonylation using CO surrogate 2\nLevacher and coworkers applied 2 for medicinal chemistry studies to develop acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Scheme 10).39 The resulting trichlorophenyl ester was utilized as a platform to access various esters and amides to further investigate structure-activity relationships.\nScheme 10. CO surrogate 2 applied for medicinal chemistry studies.\nXu, Xie, and coworkers employed N-formylsaccharin (3) for the asymmetric total synthesis of xiamenmycin A (Scheme 11).40 To introduce an amide functional group, bromoarene 6 was converted into an acyl fluoride using 3 and potassium fluoride, which then reacted with a protected amino acid in a one-pot procedure to complete the synthesis of the xiamenmycin A structure.\nScheme 11. Utilization of CO surrogate 3 for the total synthesis of xiamenmycin A\nIt is important to note that the use of CO surrogates sometimes results in better product yields than using CO gas. This might be ascribed to the effective equilibrium shift of the carbonyl-ligated metal to form an oxidative addition intermediate due to the suppression of the excessive coordination of CO to a metal center.41 Since the CO amount used in chemical reactions can be strictly controlled by applying CO surrogates, several total synthesis benefited from their use. Ito and coworkers utilized 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl formate (2) in the synthesis of pleurolactone (Table 1).42 Compound 2 outperformed CO gas in the carbonylation of enol triflate 7, affording the desired aryl ester in a gram-scale transformation.\nTable 1. Employing CO surrogate 2 for the total synthesis of pleurolactone\nA more striking effect of a CO surrogate has been demonstrated by Namba, Nakayama, and coworkers, who utilized N-formylsaccharin (3) for a carbonylation/lactonization cascade to create the bicyclic (-)-eurotiumide A structure (Table 2).43 While atmospheric CO gas generated the desired lactone 8 and 9 in only 8% yield, the use of 3 dramatically improved the yield to 65% and finally 95% at a slightly higher temperature. They finally succeeded in a 9.8 g-scale reaction of the starting bromide to provide 9 (5.7 g) through the removal of one methoxymethyl (MOM) group by a one-pot treatment with MgBr2 after the carbonylation.\nTable 2. Application of CO surrogate 3 for the total synthesis of (-)-eurotiumide A.\nFurthermore, Reisman and coworkers have elegantly demonstrated a carbopalladation/carbonylation/lactonization sequence as a key transformation for the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-perseanol (Scheme 12).44 While this transformation was promoted by a stoichiometric amount of a Pd complex and CO gas, the application of 3 as a CO surrogate enabled the catalytic conversion of bromoalkene 10 into the desired lactone as a single diastereomer, thereby creating the tetracyclic core.\nScheme 12. Use of CO surrogate 3 for the total synthesis of (+)-perseanol\nIn summary, aryl formates or N-formylsaccharin have witnessed a wide range of synthetic applications as CO surrogates. Due to the beneficial features of these CO surrogates regarding stability, safety, practicality, and commercial availability, the catalytic external-CO-free carbonylation is used as a reliable and standard strategy to generate a variety of carboxylic acid derivatives. Some applications of CO surrogates, especially in the total synthesis of biologically active compounds, clearly indicate the excellent functional group compatibility and potential scalability of this type of carbonylation."

Setup for procedure A (Note 3)\nOnce at ambient temperature, the Schlenk line is switched to argon flow (Note 2) and the setup is maintained under a slight positive argon pressure. (Iodomethyl)triphenylphosphonium iodide (47 g, 88 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 4) is added, then the NS14 and NS29 glass stoppers are replaced with rubber septa. Tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) (Note 5) is transferred into the flask by cannula, then stirring (500 rpm) is initiated, forming a cloudy off-white suspension. The rubber septum (NS29) is replaced with a glass thermometer adapter (NS29) equipped with a thermometer (range of -100 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C). (Figure 2i).\nFigure 2. (i) Appearance of suspension after (iodomethyl)triphenyl-phosphonium iodide added and stirring initiated. (ii) Appearance of suspension after NaHMDS addition has been completed (Note 3)\nThe 100-mL addition funnel is charged with NaHMDS (2.0 M in THF, 45 mL, 88 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 6) by two successive additions using a 25- mL gastight syringe. The solution of NaHMDS in THF is added to the white suspension through the dropping funnel in a dropwise manner over 10 min at 21 \u00b0C, which results in a clear red solution that transitions into a turbid dark red solution over 5 min (Figure 2ii). No discernable exotherm is observed over the course of the addition.\nThe walls of the addition funnel are rinsed three times with THF (3 x 5 mL), delivered by a 5-mL gastight syringe. The reaction flask is then placed in a Dewar vessel and cooled to -75 \u00baC (internal reaction temperature) using a dry ice-acetone mixture. This process takes around 15 minutes. To the rinsed 100-mL addition funnel is added a solution of p-methoxybenzaldehyde (10 g, 73 mmol) (Note 7) in THF (50 mL). The aldehyde solution is added dropwise to the reaction flask via the addition funnel over 1 h, with close monitoring to ensure the internal temperature does not rise above -75 \u00baC. The walls of the addition funnel are then rinsed with THF (2 x 5 mL), which are added dropwise over 5 min to the reaction flask. The addition funnel is removed and replaced by a NS14 rubber septum to allow for removal of aliquots. The clear deep red solution is stirred at - 75 \u00baC (internal temperature) until completion of the reaction (Note 8), which requires 1.5 h. Upon completion, the reaction is quenched with aqueous saturated solution of NH4Cl (150 mL) added as a single portion using a 250-mL graduated cylinder. The dry ice-acetone bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The contents of the flask are diluted with n-pentane (150 mL) and are filtered by suction filtration through a celite pad (3 cm deep) on a 10-cm diameter sintered funnel (porosity 2, coarse) into a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The reaction flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (2 x 30 mL) and the celite pad is flushed with diethyl ether (150 mL). The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is collected and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried with MgSO4 and filtered through a 10 cm diameter sintered funnel (porosity 2, coarse) into a 2-L single-necked, round-bottomed flask. The round-bottomed flask, covered with aluminum foil, is placed on a rotary evaporator and the solvent is removed at 250 to 35 mmHg at 30 \u00b0C resulting in the crude product as a viscous brown oil. The crude residue is subjected to flash column chromatography (Note 9) to give iodoalkene 1 (13.61 g, 72%, 99% purity; Z:E = 97:3) as a clear yellow oil (Notes 10 and 11).",
            "B. (Z)-2-(4-Methoxystyryl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (2) . The reaction is performed with the lights turned off in the fume hood and the laboratory. A 250-mL, three-necked (NS29, NS14, NS14) round-bottomed flask with a 40-mm egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar is stored overnight in a 200 \u00b0C oven. The flask is removed from the oven, equipped with a glass stopper (NS29), a glass gas adaptor with a argon inlet (NS14), and a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (NS14) dried overnight in the oven topped with a glass stopper (NS14), and the argon adapter is connected to a Schlenk line. The setup is allowed to cool to ambient temperature while under reduced pressure (0.15 mmHg). Once at ambient temperature, the reduced pressure is replaced by a slightly positive pressure of argon (Note 2), the NS29 and NS14 glass stoppers are replaced with rubber septa (Figure 3). To the reaction flask is added, successively by syringe, diethyl ether (80 mL) (Note 5), followed by (Z)-1-(2-iodovinyl)-4-methoxybenzene 1 (4.0 g, 15 mmol, 1 equiv) and finally 2-Isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (8.0 mL, 39 mmol, 2.6 equiv) (Note 12) and the NS29 rubber septum is replaced with a glass thermometer adapter equipped with a thermometer (range -100 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C). Stirring is initiated (500 rpm) and a clear pale-yellow solution is formed, which is cooled to -75 \u00b0C (internal temperature) using a dry ice-acetone bath over 10 min.\nFigure 3. (i) Setup for procedure B. (ii) Dropwise addition of n-butyllithium at -75 \u00b0C (Note 3)\nOnce cooled, the dropping funnel is charged with n-butyllithium (1.51 M in hexanes, 23 mL, 35 mmol, 2.3 equiv) (Note 13) via a 30-mL gas tight syringe and is subsequently added dropwise at such a rate that maintains an internal reaction temperature below -75 \u00b0C. The addition is complete after 1.6 h, which results in formation of a clear pale-yellow solution. The walls of the addition funnel are rinsed with diethyl ether (5 mL) delivered by syringe and the reaction mixture is stirred at -75 \u00b0C for a further 30 min. The reaction mixture is then removed from the dry-ice bath and is stirred for a further 2 h (Note 14). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel containing saturated aqueous NH4Cl (120 mL) and deionized water (60 mL). The reaction flask is rinsed into the separatory funnel with diethyl ether (10 mL), deionized water (10 mL) and diethyl ether (10 mL). The organic layer is collected and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 60 mL). The organic layers are combined and washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (100 mL), dried with MgSO4 (16 g, 5 min), and finally filtered through a 10-cm diameter sintered funnel (porosity 2, coarse) into a 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask at water aspirator pressure. The flask containing MgSO4 is rinsed with EtOAc (3 x 20 mL) and filtered. The round-bottomed flask is placed on a rotary evaporator and the solvent is removed at 150 mmHg to 20 mmHg at 25 \u00b0C resulting in the crude product as a pale-yellow oil. The crude residue is subjected to column chromatography (Note 15) to give the desired alkenylboronic ester 2 (3.28 g, 82%, 99% purity) as a pale-yellow oil (Notes 16 and 17)."

            "The use of benzyne annulation chemistry for the construction of N-containing heterocycles has seen significant growth in the literature in the last 15 years. One of the practical routes to these heterocycles begins with a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of benzyne (generated in situ from o-silylaryl triflates and fluoride ion) and diazo compounds. As reported by the Larock group,2 the initial adduct, 3H-indazole, may further rearrange to form 1H-indazole (it depends on the nature of the diazo compound and the substituents on the benzyne). Our 2010 Organic Syntheses report3 presents a large-scale synthesis (4.98 g) of a 1H-indazole derivative from ethyl diazoacetate. After this article, additional approaches to a family of indazoles (1H, 2H, and 3H) have been published, starting from o-silylaryl triflates and diazo compounds. This discussion addendum is intended to cover these reports.\nTopics covered will be:\n- Reaction of benzynes with monosubstituted diazo derivatives;\n- Reaction of benzynes with disubstituted diazo derivatives;\n- Reaction of benzynes with a-diazo phosphonates.\nReaction of Benzynes with Monosubstituted Diazo Derivatives\nAs the early reports by Yamamoto4,5 and Larock2 disclose, the reaction of benzynes (such as 1) with monosubstituted diazo compounds 2 always leads to 1H-indazoles 4, as a result of rearrangement of the initially formed 3H-indazole 3 to the 1H-indazole 4 during the course of the reaction (Scheme 1). The rearrangement is supposedly a 1,3-hydrogen shift, or a series of two 1,5-hydrogen shifts. The difference between Yamamoto's and Larock's reports is in that the former4,5 utilizes KF in THF at room temperature with an 18-crown-6 additive, while the latter2 utilizes TBAF in THF at -78 \u00b0C followed by warming up to room temperature. Furthermore, if an excess of benzyne is present, the free N-H indazole 4 is further converted to an N-arylated derivative (5, in the case of the unsubstituted benzyne); a closely related transformation has been reported as a standalone procedure in 2006.6 In both Yamamoto's and Larock's reports, the in situ formation of 5 has been achieved using 2 or more equiv of the benzyne precursor in the presence of CsF in CH3CN at room temperature. Both procedures taken together allow one to obtain 1H-indazoles (free and arylated) with R = ester, ketone, and Ph, in 56-97% yields, using an unsubstituted benzyne. Using both procedures, TMS-substituted diazomethane (2, R = TMS) afforded a desilylated product (4, R = H) in a lower yield (43-50%), with addition of CH3OH to the reaction mixture being necessary.\nScheme 1. Initial syntheses of 1H-indazoles by Larock and Yamamoto\nThe scope of the overall transformation was expanded in 2015, when Ma reported the reaction of CF3CHN2 (7) with o-silylaryl triflates (Scheme 2).7 In this case, running the reaction in THF at room temperature in the presence of CsF and a common phase transfer catalyst, [Et3NBn]Cl (TEBAC), provided the highest yield, 81% using the unsubstituted benzyne precursor 6. Perhaps due to the relatively large ratio of the diazo compound to the benzyne precursor (4/1), formation of the over-arylated indazole (9) has not been observed.\nScheme 2.

Neopentyl 3,4-dichlorophenylboronic ester (2) A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) containing a 4-cm x 1-cm, rod-shaped, Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar is charged with 3,4-dichlorophenylboronic acid (8.00 g, 41.9 mmol, 1 equiv), followed by neopentyl glycol (4.80 g, 46.1 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 2). A graduated cylinder is used to measure toluene (200 mL), which is then poured into the round-bottomed flask to give a cloudy, white suspension (Note 3). The flask is then fitted with a 24/40 Dean-Stark trap, and the trap is filled with 22 mL of toluene. The Dean-Stark trap is fitted with a 24/40 reflux condenser - the top of the reflux condenser is left open to air. With water running through the condenser, the flask is lowered into a silicone oil bath pre-heated to 140 \u00baC (Figure 1). The stirring solution is heated at reflux for 1.5 h, at which point no further water is observed to be condensing in the Dean-Stark trap (Note 4) (Figure 2). The flask is removed from the oil bath, and is allowed to cool in the air until the internal temperature is 23 \u00baC, as measured by a thermocouple. The clear, pale yellow solution is poured into a 500-mL, separatory funnel (29/42 joint), and the organic layer is washed with deionized water (4 x 60 mL) (Note 5).\nFigure 1.

The magnesium sulfate is removed by gravity filtration using a 60-mL, medium-porosity, sintered-glass fritted funnel, into a tared, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask (14/20 joint). The toluene is removed by rotary evaporation (30 \u00baC, 112-37 mmHg) to give a flakey white solid. The product is dried under high vacuum (23 \u00baC, 0.3 mmHg) for 20 h to yield neopentyl 3,4-dichlorophenylboronic ester (10.30 g, 104% yield, 95% purity) as a bench-stable, white solid (Notes 7, 8, 9, and 10).",

The 14/20 ground glass joint atop the addition funnel is equipped with a rubber septum, and the apparatus is evacuated and allowed to cool under vacuum (1.0 mmHg) (Note 11) (Figure 3). Once the apparatus is cool, it is backfilled with nitrogen, and the rubber septum is removed. Using a HDPE powder funnel, neopentyl 3,4-dichlorophenyl-boronic ester 2 (6.21 g, 24.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) and Pd-P(t-Bu3)-G3 (229 mg, 0.40 mmol, 0.02 equiv) are charged into the reaction vessel (Note 12). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, and evacuated (<1.0 mm Hg) and backfilled with nitrogen three times.\nFigure 3. Reaction cooling under vacuum\n(photo provided by submitters)\nIn a glovebox (Note 13), a 50-mL, pear-shaped flask (14/20 joint) is charged with TMSOK (3.59 g, 28.0 mmol, 1.40 equiv) and sealed with a rubber septum (Note 14). The pear-shaped flask is removed from the glovebox and set aside. Using a 50-mL plastic syringe equipped with a metal needle, THF (10 mL) is added to the three-necked flask. (Note 15). Next, 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline (2.28 mL, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) is added to the three-necked flask using a 3 mL plastic syringe (Note 16) (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Step B reaction set-up\n(photo provided by submitters)\nA 50-mL plastic syringe with metal needle is used to add THF (30 mL) to the 50-mL pear-shaped flask that contains TMSOK. The TMSOK is dissolved using minimal sonication to afford a clear, colorless solution (Note 17). Once prepared, the TMSOK solution is transferred into the addition funnel using a plastic, 50-mL syringe equipped with a metal needle. A thermocouple probe is inserted into the reaction vessel through the septum to monitor internal temperature, and the TMSOK solution is added dropwise over 30 min at 22 \u00baC (Note 18) (Figure 5). Upon initial addition of the TMSOK solution, a red-orange color evolves and solids (KBr) begin to precipitate from solution. Solids continue to precipitate over the course of the reaction, and the suspension becomes brown over time (Figure 6).\nFigure 5. Addition of TMSOK\nFigure 6. Completion of Addition\n(photos provided by submitters)\n\nAfter 1.5 h (Note 19), the reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel (29/42 joint) using hexane (3 x 33 mL) to transfer all material out of the flask (Note 20). The organic phase is extracted with 1 M aqueous ethanolamine (3 x 50 mL), and then with brine (2 x 50 mL) (Note 21). The organic phase is then transferred into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and dried by adding magnesium sulfate (30g) and swirling by hand for 30 s. After 5 min, the magnesium sulfate is removed by vacuum filtration using a 55-mm B\u00fcchner funnel, 250-mL sidearm flask, and 55-mm Whatman #50 filter paper. The resulting solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00baC, 400 \u2192 40 mmHg), to give 6.84 g of a black oil. This oil is transferred into a 250-mL, Erlenmeyer flask containing a 4.0-cm x 1.0-cm rod-shaped, Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar using a pipette, with acetonitrile (2 x 25 mL) used to wash residual material over (Note 22).\nA 125-mL, Erlenmeyer flask is charged with p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (3.80 g, 20.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv), which is dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL) with brief sonication (Note 23). Using a glass pipette, the acetonitrile solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid is added to the stirring solution of crude product at 23 \u00baC dropwise over 20 min. A white solid precipitates, and the suspension is further aged with stirring at 23 \u00baC for 30 min (Figure 7). The solids are collected by vacuum filtration using a 250-mL sidearm flask, a 55-mm B\u00fcchner funnel, and 55-mm, #50 Whatman filter paper. After washing with MeCN (30 mL), the solids are dried on the filter paper by pulling air through the filter cake for 10 min (Figure 8). The still wet solids are transferred using a metal spatula into a 125-mL, Erlenmeyer flask containing a 4.0-cm x 1.0-cm rod-shaped, Teflon-coated, magnetic stir bar.\nFigure 7. Precipitation\n8. Filter cake\n(photos provided by submitters)\nToluene (50 mL) is added, and while stirring, the suspension is heated to reflux through direct contact with the hot plate over the course of 20 min (Note 24). Once the toluene began to reflux, the Erlenmeyer flask is removed from heat, and allowed to cool for a period of 3 h (Figure 9). At this point, the solids are collected by vacuum filtration using a 250-mL sidearm flask, a 55-mm B\u00fcchner funnel, and 55-mm, #50 Whatman filter paper. The solids are washed with toluene (100 mL), and dried by pulling air through the filter cake for 30 min.

The flask is charged with piperonal (1) (10.51 g, 70 mmol, 1 equiv) and dichloromethane (140 mL) (Notes 2 and 3). The flask is placed in a room temperature (26 \u00b0C) water bath, magnetic stirring is commenced (Note 4), and the contents of the flask are allowed to stir for 2 min to allow for complete dissolution. Pyridine (6.2 mL, 6.1 g, 77 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 2) is added, followed by the addition HMDS (36.7 mL, 28.2 g, 175 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2) (Note 5).\nFigure 1.

The powder funnel is removed, and a digital temperature probe is inserted to monitor the reaction temperature (Figure 1 B). The reaction is stirred at 26 \u00b0C (Note 7) and a color change is noted, starting yellow and progressing through orange until finally reaching a deep red color (Figure 1A-F) (Note 8). After 120 min (Figure 1F), the reaction progress is assessed by crude 1H NMR and GC/MS (Note 9). At this time, the solvent is removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation (Note 10) (Figure 2A) to give a thick red residue.\nFigure 2.

The sides of the flask are scraped with a spatula to release all solid material (Note 11). The flask, which still contains the stir bar, is magnetically stirred (Note 4) to allow for pulverization of the solid, thus maximizing leeching of 4 into the mother liquor. Magnetic stirring is then ceased. A 150-mL, coarse porosity, sintered glass Bu\u0308chner funnel (7.3 cm diameter) is fitted to a 1-L filter flask, which is prepared for vacuum filtration. The suspension is poured through the filtration set-up to remove the orange precipitate using diethyl ether (50 mL) to ensure complete transfer from the flask. The collected precipitate is then washed with diethyl ether (100 mL) to yield the recovered spent oxidant (Figure 2D) (Note 12 Note 12). The orange filtrate is then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed sequentially with 2 M HCl (3 \u00d7 150 mL), saturated NaHCO3 (2 \u00d7 150 mL), and brine (200 mL) (Figure 3). The organic layer is then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (~ 20 g), which is removed by gravity filtration, and the solvent is removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation (Note 10) to yield 9.91 g (96%) of crude piperonylonitrile, 4 (Figure 4A). The nitrile is further purified by recrystallization (Note 13) using a minimal amount (40 mL) of a hot (~60 \u00b0C) 7:3 (v/v) mixture of hexanes/ethyl acetate (Note 14).\nFigure 3.

            "Halogenation reactions have long been viewed as one of the most useful transformations in organic synthesis, either to directly install a halogen atom or to generate a reactive intermediate that can promote further transformations (i.e. cyclization, ring-expansion, etc.). In a 2011 Organic Syntheses article,2 Snyder and Treitler outlined the development of a novel, highly electrophilic bromonium ion source, BDSB (Et2SBr\u2022SbCl5Br), and discussed its successful application to bromonium-induced polyene cyclizations of varied substrates.3 In 2015, an update to the general reaction scope that BDSB can facilitate was published in the Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (EROS).4 At that time, BDSB had been applied to several reaction processes outside of polyene cyclizations, including both ring-expanding bromoetherification5,6,7,8 as well as electrophilic aromatic bromination,9,10,11 with results in some cases that were not replicated by other bromonium sources. In this contribution, further exploration of the general scope of BDSB using examples that either were not covered in that EROS contribution or that have appeared in more recent work, is provided. The scope of these efforts is split across three major applications: (1) bromonium-induced polyene cyclizations, (2) electrophilic bromination of aromatic rings, and (3) bromoetherifications.\n\nBromonium-Induced Polyene Cyclizations\nIn 2016, Snyder et al. reported two distinct strategies toward the bromo-chamigrene collection of natural products, which includes (\u00b1)-dactylone (8, Scheme 1).12 One of these was a putative biomimetic approach utilizing BDSB to enact a polyene cyclization. Of note, in the key transformation converting 5 into 6, not only was the polyene cyclization accomplished in a reproducible yield of 20-39% (dependent on scale) at 25 \u00b0C in MeNO2, but a second regio- and stereoselective \u03b1-bromination of the ketone occurred as well when using 2.0 equivalents of BDSB; this result was further confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis. Critical to its overall success, especially in terms of avoiding bromination of the central alkene prior to initiation at the less substituted terminal alkene, was protection of the alcohol with a deactivating group in the form of a benzoate ester. Although efforts to form (\u00b1)-dactylone (8) from this product were unsuccessful, intermediate 10, which shares the same overall patterning of the desired targets, could be obtained, albeit in low yield.\nScheme 1. Polyene cyclization towards the bromo-chamigrene framework\nIn more recent efforts, several groups have sought to develop additional reagents that can serve as powerful bromonium ion sources, with BDSB being used as a typical point of comparison. For example, Gulder and co-workers discovered in 2018 that the use of NBS in HFIP with a morpholine\u2022HFIP additive could achieve polyene cyclization yields commensurate to BDSB in most cases (Table 1). However, there were some examples which showed higher yield and/or diastereoselectivity. At present, these results suggest a strong substrate-dependence within the context of this transformation, with no particular trends being obvious other than BDSB generally does not perform well in the presence of free alcohols (as in 19, vide infra).\nAs exemplified in the X-ray crystal structure of BDSB, the antimonate counterion generates a more naked source of bromonium ion than the complex of a simple sulfide with molecular Br2 alone by increasing the distance between the two bromine atoms of the original halogen source. Similarly, the Hennecke group sought to develop a new brominating agent based on counterion selection that could serve as an alternative to BDSB in polyene cyclizations. They ultimately found that tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] borate (BArF-) served as a desirable coordinating counterion that could greatly increase the reactivity of the bromiranium ion of adamantylidene adamantane ([Ad2Br][BArF]).14 Although the yields observed for their initial polyene substrates proved to be lower than that of BDSB (Table 2), they were able to further expand their reaction scope in 2019 to the cyclization of indole terpenoid polyenes such as 29 (Table 3),15 achieving superior yields to all other known cyclization methods/tools.3,13 These conditions were applicable to the cyclization of farnesyl indoles, establishing a pentacyclic core in a single step.\nOf global note, BDSB was shown to provide the desired product in all cases screened across the examples delineated in this section. While in some examples those yield values were low compared to other reagents, that broad utility for this reaction process appears to be a unique feature.\n\nElectrophilic Bromination\nGiven the highly electrophilic nature of BDSB, it is typically able to achieve selective bromination of the most electron-rich olefin or aromatic system within a scaffold of interest, even when multiple variants of each are present. In some cases, though, selectivity can be challenging to achieve. For instance, in work by Peng et al. in 2018 during their synthetic efforts toward podophyllotoxin and related family members,16 it was shown that when 31 (Scheme 2) was exposed to BDSB, they obtained an over-brominated product in which the most electron-rich aromatic ring was brominated as well as the electron-rich alkene of the enol ether. While sub-optimal here, with TBCO affording the desired adduct (i.e. 32), it does highlight the power of BDSB to execute electrophilic aromatic substitutions without the need for any added Lewis acids.\nScheme 2. Electrophilic bromination on the way to (-)-podophyllotoxin\nThat property proved advantageous during the Harran group's synthesis of (-)-ageliferin (Scheme 3),17 where these researchers faced the practical problem of poor substrate solubility given the highly polar nature of their advanced intermediates, thus affording challenges for further derivatization in general terms. However, they found that bromination of the pyrrole rings improved solubility, and here the only bromination source that yielded a desirable result with 33 in reasonable yield was BDSB. That event provided the tetra-brominated product 34 in 47% yield with high regioselectivity in the four brominations achieved. Other halogen sources such as Br2 and NBS could react with 33, but uncontrolled/non-specific polyhalogenation was observed instead. As shown in Scheme 3, this product could then be properly manipulated over 3 steps,18 including a chemoselective SmI2-mediated reduction event which also regioselectively cleaved two of the four bromines introduced by BDSB, to generate (-)-ageliferin (36).\nScheme 3. Electrophilic tetrabromination on the way to (-)-ageliferin\n\nBromoetherification\nAmong functional groups involving bromine atoms, cyclic bromoethers are common structural motifs, particularly in natural products obtained from marine sources. Despite that ubiquity, however, they can be challenging to synthesize through direct cyclization reactions involving bromonium-activated alkene electrophiles and alcohol nucleophiles. For example, one of the most difficult is the direct formation of 6-endo cyclization products when 5-exo products can also result, especially in flexible systems lacking high degrees of locking sp2-hybridization. For example, in 2014, Koshino, Takahashi, and co-workers sought to develop an efficient synthesis of aldingenin C,19 a novel halogenated terpenoid from the Laurencia family of natural products.20 During their investigations, they sought to construct a brominated tetrahydropyran (THP) fused to a 2-oxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane system, which they envisioned could be mediated by an electrophilic bromonium source (i.e. the formation of 39 from 37, Table 4). Despite screening BDSB, TBCO, and DBDMH in various solvents and temperatures, they only observed the dominant formation of the respective tetrahydrofuran (THF) analogue (38). Only in the case of TBCO in MeNO2 at 0 \u00b0C, was the desired THP product 39 obtained in 25% yield along with 38 in 20% yield (entry 3, Table 4). BDSB resulted in the formation of 38 in up to 15% yield in EtOAc and MeCN at 0 \u00b0C for both cases, with 4% and 2% yields of 39, respectively.\nIn 2015, Snyder et al. provided a potential explanation for the modest observed product formation for these events.21 Specifically, it was found that the desired 6-endo BDSB-induced bromoetherifications to form THP systems provided moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivity when the respective cyclization precursor was a secondary alcohol versus the tertiary alcohol counterpart (see Table 5). Although the subsequent addition of methyl groups to generate what would formally have been tertiary alcohol precursors did not succeed, a variety of derivatizations were possible with the presence of a benzylic group at position R. As for the tertiary alcohol precursors that would directly map to known natural products, ~1:1 mixtures of the 6-endo and 5-exo products were observed at low temperatures (-25 \u00b0C in MeNO2), but use of higher temperatures, longer reaction times, and/or subsequent exposure to acid or re-exposure to BDSB resulted in the formation of the 5-exo product exclusively. Calculations (MM2) also suggested the thermodynamic product is the 5-exo cyclization, thus indicating the 5-exo product is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored for most tertiary alcohol-containing substrates. Indeed, among bromoetherifications, this reaction (first explored in depth by Corey and co-workers, where 5-exo products also predominated)22 remains one of the most challenging for available bromonium sources.\nTable 5. Selective 6-membered bromoether formation\nBy contrast, events that can resize rings, particularly those with strain, can perform quite well with appropriate bromonium sources to generate bromoether products. One example involving cyclopropane starting materials was described by Hennecke et al. in 2015.23 Here, it is believed that the highly strained nature of the cyclopropane ring within substrates such as 42 confers upon it similar reactivity as unsaturated C-C bonds when appropriate nucleophiles are nearby (Table 6).24,25 In this case, although elemental Br2 and less electrophilic brominating reagents such as TBCO and NBS provided the desired halocyclization product (43) in modest to good yields (41-60%), the highly electrophilic brominating reagent BDSB produced an impressive 79% yield (Table 4, Entry 4). This result was only matched by DBDMH (76%) when the reaction was performed in CH2Cl2.\nTable 6. Halocyclization of cyclopropanol 42\nThe Snyder group has also greatly expanded the applicability of BDSB and ring-expanding bromoetherifications to the total syntheses of numerous members of the Laurencia family of natural products as a means to prepare 8-membered bromoether ring systems. Nine members have been prepared to date,5, 26,27 six since the publication of the BDSB review in EROS.4 In recent cases, the use of BDSB allowed for the development of a general synthetic approach to the core of many Laurencia family members (Scheme 4),26 and was applied for both ring-expanding bromoetherification (44\u00ae46) as well as bromoallene formation (47\u00ae48/49 and 50\u00ae51/52), both facilitated through silyl elimination. Impressive, in the latter two cases in particular, was the selectivity of the BDSB reagent in the presence of several potentially reactive \u03c0-systems, including a new alkene formed at the end of the sequence. However, it must be noted that in all three cases the transformations were not fully diastereoselective, with each case having its own inherent structural bias leading to one product over another. For instance, the desired diastereomer of desepilaurallene (46) was consistently found to be the minor diastereomer in terms of the stereochemistry produced at the positions denoted by the red stars (in a 3:4 ratio). Biosynthetically, these results potentially indicate that the additional rings and stereocenters attached to the portion of the molecule undergoing ring-resizing cannot fully control the stereoselectivity if Nature were to use a similar event as part of her construction.\nScheme 4. BDSB-induced ring-expanding bromoetherification and bromoallene formation\nNevertheless, this reaction process has significant breadth, as was demonstrated most recently when the Snyder group also applied BDSB in two distinct steps towards the total synthesis of laurendecumallene B (58, Scheme 5).27 First, a ring-expanding bromoetherification facilitated by a Boc-protected secondary alcohol was used to form the 8-membered cyclic bromoether 55 with 7:1 d.r., favoring the cis-disposition of the hydrogen atoms at the red-starred positions. This process required thorough screening, and was only successful with moderate yield (~50%) and an optimal d.r. of 7:1 when using CH2Cl2 at 0 \u00b0C. Of note, the event was successful despite the presence of a potentially sensitive aldehyde functional group. Furthermore, the conditions developed by the Gulder group (NBS in HFIP with added morpholine\u2022HFIP salt)13 resulted in no reaction. Lastly, the second BDSB-induced transformation, leading here to the targeted natural product (58), records the first example of BDSB fashioning a bromoallene from a free alcohol/enyne precursor.27 Although it is believed the resultant epimeric ratio from this type of transformation can be solvent dependent based on other findings in related systems,28 a ~1:1 d.r. was consistently observed here across several solvents.\nScheme 5. Total synthesis of laurendecumallene B using BDSB\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, the highly electrophilic bromonium agent BDSB has proven to be a valuable tool for various aspects of chemical synthesis. These processes include accomplishing unique polyene cyclizations in high yield and diastereoselectivity, serving as a simple to use and highly reactive electrophilic brominating reagent for aromatic systems, and allowing for the elegant and efficient construction of bromoallene and medium-sized cyclic bromoethers. Furthermore, BDSB has also acted as a strong and consistent benchmark for the development of new brominating reagents in the decade since its introduction, and it is hoped that it will inspire additional tools of high utility in the years to come as well as be used for new and useful applications."

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottom flask (24/40 ground glass joint, Flask A) is equipped with a 4.5 x 1.75-cm magnetic stir bar (Teflon-coated, egg-shaped), a rubber septum, a glass stopper, and a vacuum adapter with a stopcock (in the open position; connected to a dual manifold with bubbler). Flask A is evacuated (0.3 mmHg), flame-dried, and allowed to cool to room temperature under vacuum (Figure 1). The flask is then backfilled with a nitrogen atmosphere.\nFigure 1. Assembled reaction apparatus (flask A)\n(photo provided by submitter)\nFlask A is then charged with bis(pinacolato)diboron (12.7 g, 50.0 mmol, 2.00 equiv) (Note 2), 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene (7.18 g, 37.5 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 3), and sodium tert-butoxide (3.60 g, 37.5 mmol, 1.50 equiv) (Note 4). The flask is then purged with a nitrogen atmosphere by three evacuation-backfill cycles (Note 5). Anhydrous THF (225 mL) (Notes 6 and 7) is then added via syringe and the suspension stirred in a 30 \u00b0C water bath for 30 min. A 50-mL Schlenk flask (14/20 joint, Flask B) is equipped with a rubber septum, evacuated (0.3 mmHg), and flame-dried. Flask B is allowed to cool under vacuum and backfilled with a nitrogen atmosphere before being charged with nickel dichloride (dimethoxyethane adduct) (286 mg, 1.30 mmol) (Note 8). Flask B is then purged with a nitrogen atmosphere by three evacuation-backfill cycles (Note 9). N,N-Dimethylacetamide (26 mL) (Note 10) is then added via syringe to flask B, and flask B is swirled to completely dissolve the nickel dichloride (dimethoxyethane adduct) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

The stopcock on the vacuum adapter is then closed and a nitrogen inlet (connected to a Schlenk line and bubbler) is inserted into the rubber septum. The now purple suspension is allowed to stir at 30 \u00baC for 24 h (Note 12) (Figure 3), during which the suspension took on a light pink color (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Flask A containing the reaction mixture after 24 h\n(photo provided by submitter)\nThe reaction mixture is then transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel containing 1 M hydrochloric acid (200 mL) (Note 13). Diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 14) is used to rinse the round-bottomed flask and the ether is added to the separatory funnel. The separatory funnel is sealed with a glass stopper and shaken. The aqueous layer is separated from the organic layer and the organic layer placed in a 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask. The aqueous layer is then extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 150 mL). The organic extracts are combined in the 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and the aqueous layer is discarded. The contents of the 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask are transferred back into the 1000\u2011mL separatory funnel and washed with 1 M potassium hydroxide (3 x 200 mL) (Note 15). The organic layer is transferred to the 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask, the aqueous layer is discarded, and diethyl ether (50 mL) is used to rinse the separatory funnel and added to the Erlenmeyer flask. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate (15 g) (Note 16), and gravity filtered through filter paper into a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask. The 1000\u2011mL Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (50 mL), which is filtered through the filter paper, and the filter paper is rinsed with additional diethyl ether (50 mL). The solvent then is removed under reduced pressure via rotary evaporation (ca. 10 mmHg, water bath temperature 30 \u00baC), and further dried at 0.3 mmHg for 1 h to provide the crude mixture as a yellow oil. The crude mixture is purified via silica gel flash column chromatography with hexanes and diethyl ether as the eluent (Notes 17, 18, and 19). The product-containing fractions are transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated via rotary evaporation (ca. 10 mmHg, water bath temperature 30 \u00baC). The resulting oil is transferred to a pre-weighed 20-mL scintillation vial. The flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (3 x 3 mL) to ensure quantitative transfer. The contents of the scintillation vial are concentrated via rotary evaporation (ca. 10 mmHg, water bath temperature 30 \u00baC), and dried at 0.3 mmHg for 4 h to yield 2 (6.67 g, 87%) as an air and moisture stable white solid (Notes 20 and 21) (Figure 5).\nFigure 5.

The combined organic layers are filtered through a sand (Note 36), celite (Note 37), silica gel (Note 38) and 3-aminopropyl-functionalized silica gel (NH silica) (Note 39) pad (Note 40) on a sintered glass funnel (6.5 cm diameter, medium porosity) under vacuum suction, and the pad is washed with CH2Cl2 (100 mL) (Note 26) followed by EtOAc (200 mL) (Note 41) (Figure 4G). The filtrate (Figure 4H) is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 \u00b0C, 15 mmHg) and dried under vacuum (23 \u00b0C, 5.0 mmHg, 1 h). The crude yellow residue (Figure 4I) is recrystallized (Note 42) from toluene (Note 43) at -20 \u00b0C to provide 4 (3.90-4.59g, 6.06-7.14 mmol) as a pale white solid. The filtrate from the crystallization was evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized (Note 44) from toluene (Note 43) to provide a second batch of 4 (1.88-2.62 g, 2.93-4.08 mmol) as a pale white solid. The two crops of recrystallized product were combined to give 4 (6.47 g, 10.07 mmol, 66%) as a pale white solid (Figure 4J) (Notes 45, 46, and 47).\nFigure 4.

Via the nitrogen inlet, the round-bottomed flask is evacuated under high vacuum (5.0 mmHg, few seconds) and refilled with nitrogen (three cycles). Toluene (40 mL) (Note 4), trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (0.35 mL, 4.0 mmol, 10 mol%) (Note 5) and acrylic acid (13.7 mL, 200 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 6) are added via a syringe in less than 1 min each through the rubber septum. The reaction mixture is further degassed by bubbling N2 via a metal needle (16 gauge) for 20 min at room temperature with stirring. The flask is immersed in a silicone oil bath and the bath is heated to 130 \u00b0C (Figure 1B). The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 7).

The side necks are fitted with a 15/25 rubber septa. The central neck is equipped with a connecting adapter (upper outer joint 29/42, lower inner joint 15/25) and a water-cooled reflux Dimroth condenser (20.0 cm height, 15/25 joint), which is topped with a 15/25 three-way cock connected to a Schlenk line (Note 2). All junctures of the glassware and the rubber septa of the side-neck of the flask are sealed with Teflon tape (Figure 1A). The rubber septum of the side-neck of the flask is removed and the magnesium turning (2.40 g, 98.0 mmol, 4.9 equiv) (Note 3) (Figure 1B) is added through the side neck. The rubber septum is reattached and sealed with Teflon tape. The resultant magnesium is dried by heating with a heat gun under vacuum (3.2 mmHg) for 3 min, after which the flask is backfilled with argon (Figure 1C). This process is repeated three times. The reflux condenser is kept at room temperature (23 \u00baC) with a constant flow of water. Following the addition of THF (30 mL) (Note 4) by a syringe through the rubber septum on the side-neck of the flask (Figure 2A), the reaction vessel is placed in a pre-heated 70 \u00baC silicone oil bath and stirred for 25 min.\nFigure 1. (A) Reaction set-up; (B) Magnesium turnings; (C) magnesium turnings dried by heating gun under vacuum\n1,2-Dibromoethane (3.46 mL, 40 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 5) is then added to the flask via syringe over 20 sec (Note 6) through the rubber septum on the side-neck of the flask (Figure 2B) and the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 min (Figure 2C).

The rubber septum is quickly removed and replaced with a separately flame-dried air condenser with a 24/40 joint (Note 7). The reaction apparatus is then placed in an oil bath preheated to 75 \u00baC. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously (800 RPM) for 24 h under positive argon pressure (Figure 1C).\nFigure 1.

The flask is fitted with two glass stoppers and a reflux condenser is connected to a vacuum-argon manifold with a KOH trap in-between (Figure 1). After addition of urea\u00b7H2O2 (4.85 g, 51.6 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 3) to the flask, it is evacuated and backfilled with argon gas (>99.999%) three times and purged with the gas very slowly during the reaction. Then, CH2Cl2 (100 mL) (Note 3) is added from a 100-mL syringe fitted with PFA tubing (Note 2), after replacing the two glass stoppers with a rubber septum and an internal thermometer equipped with a Teflon\u00ae adapter. The slurry is cooled with an ice-salt bath and is slowly stirred (150 rpm) (Note 4) until the temperature falls to 2\u00b11 \u00b0C (for ca. 1 h).\nFigure 1. Reaction set-up (photo provided by submitters)\nAfter cooling, trifluoroacetic anhydride (59.8 mL, 430 mmol, 10 equiv) (Note 3) is added to the mixture from a syringe fitted with PFA tubing (100-mL size) over ca. 5 min, temporarily leading to an increase of the internal temperature of 5 \u00b0C. The rubber septum is replaced with a glass cap, and the mixture is stirred at 2\u00b11 \u00b0C for 1 h (Figure 2a). Then, N-(3-buten-1-yl)phthalimide 1 (8.65 g, 43 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3) is added in one portion via a funnel, followed by the addition of [Cu(CH3CN)4]PF6 (3.21 g, 8.6 mmol, 20 mol %) (Note 3) in one portion. After the addition of the copper catalyst, the reaction mixture is warmed to 40 \u00b0C. The color of the solution changes from colorless to aqua blue, and small bubbles of carbon dioxide appear (Figure 2b) (Note 5). The mixture is stirred for 4 h and completion of the reaction is confirmed by TLC analysis (Figure 3a) (Note 6).\nFigure 2. (a) Reaction of urea\u00b7H2O2 with trifluoroacetic anhydride (b) Color change after addition of Cu catalyst (photos provided by submitters)\nThe mixture is cooled to 2\u00b11 \u00b0C and diluted with CH2Cl2 (200 mL) and transferred to a 1 L round-bottomed flask. While further cooling, sat. K2CO3 aqueous solution (300 mL) is added while monitoring the appearance of bubbles due to neutralization. Initially, this addition is performed drop wise, using a Pasteur pipette. After ~50 mL have been added in this manner, the remaining solution is slowly poured into the vigorously stirred mixture over the course of 2 min. The mixture is further stirred at ambient temperature (22-25 \u00b0C) for 1 h and transferred to a separatory funnel (1-L size). The aqueous layer is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 200 mL), allowing the mixture to stand for 10 min each time to ensure adequate separation of the phases. The organic phases are combined in an Erlenmeyer flask (2-L size). The combined organic phase is washed with brine (50 mL) and dried over 50 g of anhydrous Na2SO4. The absence of peroxides in the organic phase is confirmed by using a peroxide detection strip (Figure 3b) (Notes 7 and 8). The organic phase is filtered into a flask (2-L size) through a sintered glass filter (100-mL size), and the filtrate is evaporated in a rotary evaporator (80 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C). The obtained crude product (12.4 g) is purified by means of chromatography on silica (Note 9). The product, containing a small amount of impurities, is obtained as a white solid (8.08 g) after concentration of the combined fractions by removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator (80 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C) and drying in vacuo (<6 mmHg) for 3 h.\nFigure 3.

The liquid phase is decanted with the aid of a glass Pasteur pipette (ca. 1.5 mL, 9-inch size; Iwaki IK-PAS-9P). The resulting white solid is further purified by repeating the crush-decantation process three more times, and then drying the residue in vacuo (<6 mmHg) for 3 h to give product 2 (5.66 g, 49% yield, 97% purity, E/Z = 88.5/11.5) (Notes 10, 11, 12, and 13) (Figure 5), which can be stored under ambient conditions.\nFigure 4.

            "The use of asymmetric catalysis in the enantioselective construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is a contemporary challenge in organic synthesis.2,3,4,5,6,7 Conjugate addition reactions of carbon nucleophiles to \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has emerged as an effective strategy to address this challenge.8 Copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition reactions generally employ highly reactive nucleophiles such as dialkylzinc,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 triorganoaluminum,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 organozirconium,28,29,30 and organomagnesium reagents.31,32,33,34 Organoaluminum nucleophiles have also been reported to participate in asymmetric conjugate addition reactions to \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds under rhodium catalysis.35 Unfortunately, use of such highly reactive organometallic species require rigorous exclusion of moisture and oxygen, and can limit the functional group tolerance of these transformations.\nEfforts by Hayashi and coworkers have led to the development of rhodium complexes to catalyze the addition of organoboron nucleophiles to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.36 In contrast to the previously mentioned organometallic nucleophiles, organoboron nucleophiles are easily handled and stored on the benchtop, and the mild nature of these reagents allow for rhodium-catalyzed conjugate addition reactions to tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. While reports of rhodium-catalyzed conjugate addition with \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are rare, chiral diene ligated rhodium complexes have proven to be effective catalysts for the formation of stereogenic all-carbon quaternary centers via this reaction manifold. Unfortunately, commercially available boronic acids are not suitable for this process, which often requires the use of tetraaryl borates37 or boroxines.38 Despite the associated advantages of rhodium-catalyzed conjugate addition, the high cost of rhodium, and oxygen sensitivity of these processes are undesirable.\nPalladium catalysis has recently emerged as a more robust and cost-effective alternative to rhodium-catalyzed conjugate addition processes. The asymmetric construction of tertiary \u03b2-substituted ketones utilizing a cationic palladium(II)-DuPHOS complex was described by Minnaard and coworkers in 2011, and displays a remarkable tolerance to air and moisture.39 Unfortunately, the conditions outlined in this report are not suitable for the asymmetric construction of quaternary stereocenters. A subsequent report from Lu and colleagues disclosed that a cationic palladium(II)-bipyridine complex is a competent catalyst for the reaction of \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones, although it is worth noting that these conditions do not allow for the construction of enantioenriched all-carbon quaternary centers.40 Given our interests in the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters, we focused our attention toward an enantioselective variant of this transformation. Described herein are recent developments in the field of palladium-catalyzed conjugate addition toward the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centers."

            "3-Phenyl-1H-pyrazole. An oven dried 250-ml, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm) is charged with 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole (6.49 g, 40.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) and RuPhos Palladacycle Gen. 4 (1.02 g, 1.20 mmol, 3.00 mol%) (Note 3). The vessel is equipped with an oven-dried reflux condenser and capped with two rubber septa. The reflux condenser is equipped with an argon inlet attached to a Schlenk line. The apparatus is evacuated, refilled with argon (3x). Toluene (55 mL, 0.73M) (Note 4) is added in two portions at room temperature via syringe through the side arm of the three-necked flask under flow of argon. The flask is charged with 2-propanol (15.3 mL, 200 mmol, 5.00 equiv) (Note 5) at room temperature via syringe through the side arm of the three-necked flask. The yellow suspension is stirred for five min under positive argon pressure. The resulting yellow solution (Figure 1A) is treated with a solution of sodium tert-pentoxide in toluene (30 mL, 3.3M, 100 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 6) under flow of argon (exothermic reaction). The resulting black suspension (Figure 1B) is transferred to an aluminum heating block equilibrated to 80 \u2103. Water is circulated through the reflux condenser. A thermometer is inserted through one neck, replacing one of the septa, and the reaction is stirred at 80 \u2103 (internal temperature = 70 \u00b0C) under argon atmosphere (Figure 1C). After 18 h, 1H and 19F NMR showed no evidence of starting material (Note 7).\nFigure 1. (A) Reaction mixture prior to addition of sodium tert-pentoxide; (B) Reaction mixture immediately after adding sodium tert-pentoxide; and (C) Reaction setup during heating\n\nThe black heterogeneous reaction mixture is removed from the heating block and allowed to cool to room temperature (Figure 2A). The reaction mixture is filtered through a pad of sand (1 cm) layered with Celite (20 g) on a fritted funnel (porosity 2) into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask (Figure 2B). The filter cake is carefully triturated with a spatula to insure a better filtration. The reaction vessel and Celite cake are then washed with ethyl acetate until the eluent is colorless (9 x 20 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u2103, 70 mmHg) to afford a thick brown paste (Figure 2C).\nFigure 2. (A) Heterogeneous reaction mixture after heating for 18 hours; (B) Reaction mixture after filtration through Celite; and (C) Filtrate after concentration by rotary evaporation\n\nThe concentrated crude material is quenched with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (40 mL) at room temperature. The resulting slurry is suspended with swirling and transferred via plastic funnel to a 125-mL separatory funnel. The round-bottomed flask containing quenched material is washed with a biphasic mixture of deionized water (5 mL) and dichloromethane (5 mL) (5 x biphasic wash) to transfer any residual product to the separatory funnel. The separatory funnel is shaken and the layers (Figure 3A) are allowed to separate over five min. The dichloromethane layer is collected in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and the aqueous layer is re-extracted with dichloromethane (4 x 20 mL) until the organic phase is colorless (Figure 3B,C). The organic fractions are treated with sodium sulfate (20 g), left to dry for 10 min and clarified by vacuum filtration on a fritted funnel into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The drying agent is washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 40 mL) to extract any residual product and the ethyl acetate washes are filtered into the dichloromethane filtrate. The combined filtrates are charged with Celite (17 g) and concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u2103, 70 mmHg).\n\nFigure 3. (A) Biphasic mixture after transferring to separatory funnel and shaking; (B) Biphasic mixture after second extraction with dichloromethane; and (C) Biphasic mixture after fourth extraction with dichloromethane\n\nA glass chromatography column (inner diameter 5 cm) is charged with silica gel (200g) (Note 8) loaded as a slurry with 40 vol% ethyl acetate in n-heptane. The silica gel slurry is allowed to settle, and excess mobile phase is eluted by gravity. Atop the silica gel slurry is loaded the crude solid adsorbed on Celite followed by a layer of sand (4 cm). The packed column is then eluted with 40 vol% ethyl acetate in n-heptane (1L) followed by ethyl acetate (1L) (Note 9). The eluent is collected in 25 x 150 mm test tubes (50 mL fractions) for 40 fractions. Fractions 13-28 contain the desired product (Note 10) and are concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 \u2103, 50 mmHg) in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. Thick oil is dissolved with EtOAc and transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the desired product (5.70 g) as a tan solid in >90% purity as assayed by 1H NMR (Figure 4A).\nThe chromatographed material is further purified by crystallization (Note 11): The solid is transferred to a tared 30-mL vial as a solid, and any residual material in the 500-mL round-bottomed flask is transferred by washing with hot benzene (4 x 2 mL, 70 \u2103) followed by pipette transfer to the 30-mL vial. The tan solid suspended in benzene is dissolved by heating the vial (aluminum heating block, 90 \u2103) until the mixture is gently refluxing (5 min reflux with intermittent swirling). The resulting, hazy orange mixture (Figure 4B) is layered with n-heptane (8 mL) (Figure 4C) and allowed to cool to room temperature over 4 h (Note 12) (Figure 4D). The recrystallization setup is then gently swirled to facilitate mixing of the benzene and n-heptane layers. The recrystallization setup is stored for 24 h at 4 \u2103, which affords large colorless crystals (Figure 4E). The supernatant is removed by pipette. The colorless crystals are washed with cold n-heptane (2 x 6 mL, 4 \u2103) and dried first by rotary evaporation (40 \u2103, 10 mmHg) then in a vacuum oven (30 \u2103, 0.1 mmHg, 4 h) to afford 3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole (5.06 g, 88% yield (4.97 g, 86% based on purity)) as a colorless solid (Figure 4F) (Notes 13 and 14).\n\nFigure 4.

The addition is complete within 5 min, at which time the dropping funnel is removed and DMF (0.1 mL) (Note 5) is added to the reaction mixture in one portion with a syringe. The solution begins to vigorously bubble.\nThe reaction flask is quickly connected in series, first to an empty wash bottle and then to a wash bottle filled with a 5 M NaOH solution (200 mL), which itself is vented to the back of the hood (Figure 1B) (Note 6).

Weinreb amide 1 is obtained as a colorless oil in a yield of 69% (24.69 g, 172.4 mmol) (Figure 2D) (Note 16 and 17).\nB. 4,5-Diiodo-1H-imidazole (2). A 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a 4.0 cm long Teflon-coated flat stir bar is charged with potassium iodide (97.53 g, 587.6 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 18). Water (300 mL) (Note 11) at 24 \u00b0C is then added to make a colorless solution. Iodine (74.56 g, 293.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 19) is then added and the resulting mixture is magnetically stirred (700 rpm) until complete dissolution of iodine (~15-20 min) (Note 20) provides a dark brown solution.\nIn parallel, a 1 L round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.2 cm long oval Teflon-coated stir bar is charged with a 2 M NaOH solution (NaOH (35.25 g, 881.3 mmol, 6.0 equiv) in H2O (440 mL)) (Note 21). To this is added imidazole (10.0 g, 146.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 22) at 24 \u00b0C to make a colorless solution. This flask is connected to a 500 mL dropping funnel capped with a rubber septum, which is filled with the before mentioned KI/I2 solution (Figure 3) (Note 23).\n\nFigure 3. Reaction setup before the addition of the KI/I2 solution.\n(Photo provided by submitters)\n\nThe KI/I2 solution is added dropwise to the imidazole solution at 24 \u00b0C within 60-90 min. Upon addition, a brownish color with concomitant formation of a white precipitate is observed, both of which rapidly disappear (Figure 4A). After complete addition, the resulting yellow solution (Figure 4B) is stirred at 24 \u00b0C for 3 h, during which the solution becomes pale-yellow to colorless (Figure 4C). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u00b0C using an ice bath and acidified. This is done by adding concentrated HCl (~48-49 mL, ~4 equiv) (Note 24) portion wise (5 x 9 mL) and then dropwise to the reaction mixture, during which a number of visual changes are observed. After each of the five 9 mL additions, a dark red/brown precipitate forms, which slowly re-dissolves with vigorous stirring (Figure 4D). The solution remains essentially colorless. As the endpoint nears, dropwise addition of HCl produces a white precipitate and a yellow/orange color in the solution, both of which disappear with stirring. Closer to the endpoint, the white precipitate persists (Figure 4E). The endpoint can be determined by color change when a yellow/orange color of the solution no longer returns to colorless. Temporarily discontinuing stirring can be helpful for making this determination. The resulting mixture is pH 8, which can be checked by pH-indicator paper. The resulting white solid is collected by vacuum filtration using a round filter paper (\u00f8 = 9 cm) in a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold (4 \u00b0C) water (2 x 250 mL). The solid material is air dried in the funnel for 1 h with house vacuum (Figure 4F) and transferred into a 1 L round-bottomed flask, using EtOH (Note 25) to quantitate the transfer. The resulting suspension is heated to reflux on a boiling water bath (Note 26) with EtOH (350 mL) to fully dissolve the solids (Note 27). The orange-colored solution is allowed to cool to 24 \u00b0C on the benchtop (Figure 4G) and afterwards in the freezer at -20 \u00b0C for 18 h. The resulting solid is collected by vacuum filtration on filter paper (\u00f8 = 9 cm) in a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with cold (-20 \u00b0C) ethanol (2 x 50 mL) and air dried on the filter for 1 h using house vacuum. The product is obtained as an off-white solid. The mother liquor is concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg), suspended in 250 mL of EtOH and recrystallized as described above to obtain a second crop of 2. The two crops are combined, finely mortared, transferred to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask (NS 24/40), and dried under high vacuum (24 \u00b0C, 2 x 10-2 mmHg) for 18 h to give 4,5-diiodoimidazole (2) as an off-white solid in a yield of 59% (27.90 g, 87.22 mmol) (Figure 4H) (Note 28 and 29).\n\nFigure 4.

An oven-dried 1 L three-necked, round-bottomed flask (3 x NS 24/40) is filled with anhydrous THF (500 mL) (Note 30 and 31), equipped with two glass stoppers, and connected to a Schlenk line with a glass adapter. Under positive nitrogen pressure, the middle glass stopper is exchanged with a glass rod equipped with a 5 cm long oval-shaped Teflon vane that is connected to an overhead stirrer (Figure 5A). Via the remaining side neck, lithium chloride (3.31 g, 78.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 32) is added and the mixture is stirred (160 rpm) (Note 33) at 24 \u00b0C under an atmosphere of nitrogen until the lithium chloride is fully dissolved (~18 h). Then finely crushed 4,5-diiodoimidazole 2 (25.0 g, 78.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 34) is added. The resulting yellow solution is cooled to 0 \u00b0C using an ice bath, whereupon a white precipitate forms (Note 35). Then the glass stopper is replaced with a silicone septum and methylmagnesium chloride (3 M solution in THF; 27.4 mL, 82.1 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 36 and 37) is added dropwise with a syringe to the reaction mixture within 5-10 min (Note 38). During addition of methylmagensium chloride the reaction mixture clarifies, and the resulting orange solution is stirred (160 rpm) at 0 \u00b0C. After 5 min the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for another 5 min (Note 39) (Figure 5D). Then isopropylmagnesium chloride lithium chloride complex (1.3 M solution in THF; 66.1 mL, 86.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) (Note 40 and 41) is added with a syringe to the reaction mixture within 10-15 min. The resulting off-white suspension is stirred (160 rpm) (Note 33) at 24 \u00b0C for 2.0-2.5 h until the iodine/magnesium exchange is considered complete by TLC monitoring (Note 42) (Figure 5E). Afterwards, neat Weinreb amide 1 (12.31 g, 86.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv) is added to the suspension dropwise with a syringe within 2-3 min (Note 43) and stirring (160 rpm) is continued for 2.0-2.5 h at 24 \u00b0C, during which the reaction mixture clarifies again to an orange-colored solution (Figure 5F). The reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 44). After completion, the reaction mixture is transferred into a 2 L separatory funnel and quenched at 24 \u00b0C by adding a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (400 mL). The reaction flask is rinsed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (25 mL) and EtOAc (25 mL) and the resulting mixture is added to the separatory funnel. The phases are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (2 x 200 mL) (Note 45). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (400 mL), dried with MgSO4 (50 g) (Note 12), filtered through a fluted filter paper in a glass funnel (Note 46), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg). The obtained off-white solid is crystallized as follows: on a gently boiling water bath, the solid is dissolved in 100 mL of EtOAc (Note 26). To the boiling hot solution is added in a portionwise fashion enough hexanes (~50 mL) (Note 47) so that the white precipitate that forms upon addition slowly disappears. The flask is then covered with a plastic yellow cap and allowed to cool to 24 \u00b0C on the bench and then at -20 \u00b0C in a freezer for 18 h. The resulting solid is collected by vacuum filtration through a round filter paper (\u00f8 = 9 cm) in a B\u00fcchner funnel, successively washed with a 1:1-mixture of cold (4 \u00b0C) EtOAc/hexanes (100 mL), cold (4 \u00b0C) hexanes (100 mL), and afterwards air dried with suction for 30 min (Note 48). The material is further dried under high vacuum (24 \u00b0C, 2 x 10-2 mmHg) for 18 h. The desired product 3 is obtained in a yield of 78% (16.91 g, 61.25 mmol) (Figure 5G) (Note 49 and 29).\n\nFigure 5.

            "A. Dimethyl 2-((4-methylphenyl)sulfonamido)malonate (2). To a single-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flask containing a football-shaped, teflon-coated stir bar (5 cm) and fitted with a 24/40 glass, threaded gas-inlet adapter with a silicone/PTFE septa (Figure 1A) (Note 2), in-turn connected via chemically resistant tubing to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold is added commercially available dimethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride (1, 12.5 g, 68.2 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (27.2 g of 90 wt. % purity, 74.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 3) as solids. The atmosphere in the flask is replaced with nitrogen by three cycles of vacuum (Note 4) and nitrogen back-filling via the vacuum/nitrogen manifold. The glass adapter is briefly removed, and tetrahydrofuran (270 mL) is then added from a polyethylene graduated cylinder. The resulting beige suspension is stirred vigorously and cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice/water bath (e.g. recrystallizing dish, Figure 1B) for 15 min before adding freshly distilled triethylamine (28.5 mL, 204 mmol, 3.0 equiv; Note 5) by rapid dropwise addition via a 60 mL, plastic, luer-lock syringe fitted with a stainless steel 18-gauge needle over ~5 min. A yellow-orange suspension forms within 1 h (Figure 1C) and gradually becomes a light-yellow color as the reaction mixture is stirred over 24 h (Note 6) (Figure 1D) and allowed to slowly warm to ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C).\nFigure 1. N-Tosylation of dimethylaminomalonate hydrochloride: A) Threaded gas-inlet adapter, 24/40 joint size, fitted with a red/white PTFE/silicone septa in an open-top screw cap. B) Prior to addition of triethylamine. C) 1 hour after addition of triethylamine. D) 16 h after addition of triethylamine (photos provided by submitters).\n\nThe yellow-orange suspension is then vacuum-filtered through a pad of celite (Note 7) (Figure 2A) into a 1 L, heavy-walled vacuum Erlenmeyer flask to remove the white precipitate by-product, which is triethylammonium p-toluenesulfonate. Quantitative transfer of the crude material to the filter funnel is carried out by rinsing with ethyl acetate from a polyethylene squirt bottle (~25 mL). The filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate (250 mL) and the filtrate is transferred to a 1 L recovery flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (~150 to 75 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature) to a yellow oil that is dry-loaded onto 70 g of silica gel (Notes 8 and 9). The resulting fine yellow powder is loaded onto a pre-packed flash chromatography column for purification (Figures 2B-C) (Note 10) and eluted to yield 13.3 g (65%) of dimethyl 2-((4-methylphenyl)sulfonamido)malonate (2) as an off-white grainy powder (Note 11) (Figure 2D).\nFigure 2.

(2E,4E)-5-Phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chloride (4). To an oven-dried (Note 12), 500 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a football-shaped, teflon-coated stir bar (4 cm) and fitted with a 24/40 glass, threaded gas-inlet adapter with a silicone/PTFE septa (Figure 1A, Note 2), in-turn attached via chemically resistant tubing to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold, is added commercially available 5-phenyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid (3) (10.0 g, 57.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 13). The atmosphere in the vessel is replaced with nitrogen by three cycles of evacuation (Note 4) and back-filling with nitrogen via the vacuum/nitrogen manifold. The hose connection to the manifold is then quickly replaced with tygon tubing connected in sequence to a mineral oil bubbler followed by a solution of saturated, aqueous sodium bicarbonate (150 mL) in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask (Figure 3A). Dichloromethane (230 mL) is then added in four portions via a 60 mL plastic syringe fitted with an 18-gauge stainless steel needle, forming a beige-colored suspension that is stirred at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). N,N-Dimethylformamide (0.67 mL, 8.6 mmol, 15 mol%) is added via a plastic 1 mL syringe in one portion, followed by dropwise addition of oxalyl chloride (14.6 mL, 173 mmol, 3.0 equiv) over 15 min via a 30 mL plastic luer-lock syringe fitted with a 20-gauge stainless-steel needle connected to a syringe pump (59 mL/h flow rate). The reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C) while venting gaseous by-products through the mineral oil bubbler/sodium bicarbonate solution (Note 14) until it became a homogenous, gold-colored solution and had ceased gas evolution (~3-4 h).\nFigure 3. Acid chloride synthesis: A) Reaction set up with mineral oil bubbler and sodium bicarbonate solution in sequence to control and quench exhaust gases. B) Crude acid chloride used in the next reaction after drying on high vacuum with an attached acid scrubber (KOH pellets) (photos provided by submitters).\n\nThe stir bar is removed and the crude reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (150 to 75 mmHg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature, ~1 h) to a light-brown, amorphous solid that is further dried under high vacuum (~3 mmHg) (Note 15) (Figure 3B) with an intervening acid scrubber column for at least 3 h to provide (2E,4E)-5-Phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chloride (4). The atmosphere in the flask is charged with nitrogen via the Schlenk manifold yielding 11.2 g (101%) of crude acid chloride as a yellow solid which is used directly in the next reaction without purification (Note 16).\nC. Dimethyl-(S,E)-5-oxo-3-styryl-1-tosylpyrrolidine-2,2-dicarboxylate (5): To an oven-dried (Note 12), 1 L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a football-shaped, teflon-coated stir bar (5 cm) is added dimethyl sulfonamidomalonate (2) (12.4 g, 41.3 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The reaction vessel is fitted with a T-bore Schlenk adapter attached to both vacuum and an argon balloon (Notes 17 and 18) (Figure 4A). The atmosphere in the flask is replaced with argon by three cycles of vacuum/back-filling via the Schlenk adapter, which is then quickly replaced with a rubber septum and an argon balloon. Tetrahydrofuran is added (210 mL, 0.20 M initial concentration of sulfonamidomalonate) (Notes 19 and 20) in four portions via a plastic 60 mL syringe fitted with an 18-gauge stainless steel needle. The resulting clear solution is stirred vigorously and cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice bath over 15 min. A newly opened 100 mL bottle of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS, 1.0 M in tetrahydrofuran, 47.5 mL, 47.5 mmol, 1.15 equiv) (Note 21) is then added dropwise from a 60 mL plastic luer-lock syringe fitted with an 18-gauge stainless-steel needle connected to a syringe pump over 15 min (189 mL/h flow rate, Figure 4B).\nFigure 4.

B) Addition of LiHMDS solution via syringe pump. C) Following complete addition of LiHMDS (photos provided by submitters).\n\nThe resulting yellow solution (Figure 4C) is further cooled for 15 min in a cryobath set to -10 \u00b0C (Note 22). 1,8-Diazobyciclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 6.85 mL, 45.4 mmol, 1.10 equiv) is then added as a very viscous liquid in a single portion via a 12 mL plastic syringe equipped with an 18 gauge needle followed by the addition of O-trimethylsilylquinine (TMSQN) solution via a 12 mL plastic syringe via a 20 gauge needle in one portion (Note 23) within 5 minutes of DBU addition. A solution of crude, (2E,4E)-5-Phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chloride (4) (1.0 M in tetrahydrofuran, 57.5 mmol, 1.39 equiv in 57.4 mL) (Note 24) is then added dropwise over 3 h from a 60 mL luer-lock plastic syringe fitted with a 16-gauge stainless-steel needle connected to a syringe pump (19 mL/h flow rate; Figure 5B-C).\nFigure 5. NCMPL Organocascade: A) Appearance of crude unsaturated acid chloride solution in THF. B) Reaction solution following addition of DBU and TMSQN. C) Addition of crude unsaturated acid chloride solution via syringe pump with cooling from a cryobath system (photos provided by submitters).\n\nThe reaction mixture is stirred at -10 to -14 \u00b0C for an additional 3 h (total reaction time = 6 h) (Note 25) and is quenched by carefully pouring the cold orange-red solution into a 1 L separatory funnel containing aqueous hydrochloric acid (1M, 150 mL). Quantitative transfer of the crude reaction mixture to the separatory funnel is carried out by rinsing the reaction vessel with ethyl acetate (150 mL). The layers are separated (Figure 6A) and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (4 x 125 mL) (Figure 6B). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated, aqueous sodium chloride solution (150 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (5 g), and filtered through Celite (Note 7) (Figure 6C) into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask. The filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate (75 mL).\nFigure 6. NCMPL reaction work up: A) Formation of layers in separation funnel upon first extraction with ethyl acetate. B) Appearance of layers in separation funnel following final extraction with ethyl acetate. C) Combined organic layers after drying and filtering through Celite (photos provided by submitters).\n\nThe filtrate is transferred to a 2 L recovery flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (~200 mm Hg, 30 \u00b0C bath temperature) until a yellow, amorphous solid forms (Figure 7A). This crude, yellow solid is transferred to a B\u00fcchner funnel (7 cm diameter) by use of a stainless-steel spatula. The solid is agitated with a spatula and washed with a minimal amount of methanol (~200 mL) from a polyethylene squirt bottle while under vacuum filtration (Note 26) (Figure 7B). After transferring the off-white solid to 6-dram vials and removing the residual solvent under high vacuum for at least 4 h (Notes 4 and 27), 13.5 g of Dimethyl-(S,E)-5-oxo-3-styryl-1-tosylpyrrolidine-2,2-dicarboxylate (5) (71% isolated yield, >99:1 er) is obtained as an off-white crystalline powder that is of sufficient purity (97% by q1H-NMR) for subsequent reactions (Notes 28 and 29).\nFigure 7.

A three-necked, 200 mL round-bottomed flask (main neck 29/32 joint, side neck 15/25) is equipped with a 5 cm Teflon-coated football shaped magnetic stir bar. All three necks are left open to the atmosphere. Acetic acid (50 mL) (Note 2) and toluene (50 mL) (Note 3) are poured into the flask via a glass funnel. 4-Cyanobenzaldehyde (7.87 g, 60.0 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 4) is dissolved in the solvent mixture, then 4-tert-butylaniline (9.0 g, 9.6 mL, 60 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 5) is added via a plastic syringe (Figure 1A). The flask is immersed in a silicone oil bath preheated to 50 \u00b0C (Notes 6 and 7).\nFigure 1. A) Addition of 4-tert-butylaniline via a syringe into dissolved 4-cyanobenzaldehyde.

Iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate (1.22 g, 1.80 mmol, 6 mol%) (Note 8) is added, causing immediate reddening of the solution (Figure 1C). Immediately after addition of Iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate, butane-2,3-dione (2.6 g, 2.6 mL, 30 mmol, 1 equiv) is added dropwise over 3 min via a plastic syringe, causing blackening of the solution (Note 9) (Figure 2A). The mixture is heated at 50 \u00b0C. After ca. 10 min, the reaction mixture turns orange and a yellow precipitate is formed (Figure 2B). The suspension is vigorously stirred for 16 h at 50 \u00b0C with all three necks uncapped to provide access of the oxygen from the air (Note 10) (Figure 2C). The oil bath is removed to allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature over 15 min (Note 11). The resulting dark mixture with yellow precipitate (Figure 3A) is treated with methanol (150 mL) (Note 12) and vacuum filtered through a Kiriyama-funnel (S-60, filter paper: No.5B, 60 mm\u03c6). The filtered solid is rinsed with methanol (150 mL) (Figure 3B), followed by diethyl ether (50 mL) (Note 13) (Figure 3C). The resulting solid is dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg) at 95 \u00b0C for 3 h (Figure 4A) to give the tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole (TAPP, compound 1) as a yellow solid (10.21 g, 17.82 mmol, 59%) (Notes 14, 15, and 16) (Figure 4B).\nFigure 2.

A 30 mL Schlenk flask (15/25 joint) is equipped with a 2 cm Teflon-coated football shaped magnetic stir bar. The flask is connected to an argon/vacuum line and the reaction setup is dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg) by heating with a heat gun and allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction set-up is backfilled with argon and the argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system. The flask is charged with allylpalladium chloride dimer ([Pd(C3H5)Cl]2, 200 mg, 0.547 mmol) (Note 18) and 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb, 460 mg, 1.08 mmol) (Note 19). The reaction set-up is evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. Anhydrous dichloromethane (10 mL) (Note 20) is added and the flask is immersed in the silicone oil bath preheated to 25 \u00b0C. The solution is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min. The initial yellow solution (Figure 5A) changes color to red in ca. 15 min (Figure 5B). The solvent is removed in vacuum (4.8 mmHg at room temperature) and dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg at room temperature for 3 h) to give a pinkish powder, which is used without further purification (Note 21) (Figure 5C-D).\nFigure 5.

A three-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flask (main neck 29/32 joint, side neck 15/25 joint) (flask A) is equipped with a 5 cm Teflon-coated football shaped magnetic stir bar. A 29/32 three-way stop cock is attached to the main neck of the flask and sealed with Teflon tape. The flask is connected to an argon/vacuum line and the reaction setup is dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg) by heating with a heat gun and allowed to cool to room temperature. Next, the reaction set-up is backfilled with argon and the flask is charged with 1 (5.73 g, 10.0 mmol, 1 equiv), 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (12.1 g, 60.0 mmol, 6 equiv) (Note 22), PdCl(C3H5)(dppb) (0.60 g, 0.98 mmol, 10 mol%) and potassium acetate (5.30 g, 54.0 mmol, 5.4 equiv) (Note 23) while purging the flask with argon. The reaction set-up is evacuated and backfilled with argon three times and sealed with a rubber septum. Dry N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 250 mL) (Note 24) is added to flask A via a cannula from a three-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a three-way stopcock and sealed with rubber septa and Teflon tape) (flask B) with the constant argon flow (Figure 6A). The three-way stopcock of the flask A is closed after solvent addition. The cannula is removed and the flask A is immersed in the silicone oil bath preheated to 150 \u00b0C (Note 25).\nFigure 6. A) Cannulation of DMA from flask B to reaction flask A. B) Initial color of the solution. C) Appearance after 30 min. D) Appearance after 90 min.\n\nGradual color change of the solution from yellow through green to black is apparent (Figures 6B-D). The solution turns black completely in ca. 90 min. The mixture is stirred at 150 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature over 30 min, the stir bar is removed and the resulting reaction mixture is transferred to 1 L round-bottomed flask, which is rinsed with ethyl acetate (60 mL) that is added to the reaction mixture (Note 26). The reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (70 \u00b0C, 10 mmHg) and dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg, 30 min, room temperature). After evaporation of the reaction mixture, the tarry-black residue (Figure 7A) is dissolved in dichloromethane (250 mL) and transferred to the 1L separatory funnel. Organic layer is washed with distilled water (2 x 250 mL), brine (250 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (30 g) (Note 27) for 2 h. The drying agent is filtered off through a cotton plug and rinsed with dichloromethane (150 mL). The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 600 to 70 mmHg) to dryness (Figure 7B) and acetonitrile (30 mL) (Note 28) is poured onto the residue. After stirring for 30 min, yellow precipitate formed is vacuum filtered through a Kiriyama-funnel (S-60, filter paper: No.5B, 60 mm\u03c6) and rinsed with acetonitrile (20 mL) (Figures 7C and 10) (Notes 29 and 30).\nFigure 7. A) Appearance of the crude reaction mixture after evaporation. B) Appearance of the concentrated organic phase after liquid-liquid extraction. C) Filtration set-up after rinsing with acetonitrile (photos provided by submitters).\n\nCollected solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (125 mL), and silica gel (50 g) (Note 31) is added to the solution. The suspension is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 540 to 70 mmHg) to dryness. The resulting solid is purified by a gradient column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/dichloromethane mixture as an eluent (Figures 8A and 11) (Notes 32, 33, and 34). Fractions containing solely the desired product are collected, combined, evaporated and dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg, 30 min, room temperature) (Figure 8B). The solid material is treated with diethyl ether (25 mL) and vacuum filtered through a Kiriyama-funnel (S-60, filter paper: No.5B, 60 mm\u03c6) and washed with diethyl ether (25 mL) (Figure 8C). The yellow crystals are collected, dried under vacuum (4.8 mmHg) at 85 \u00b0C for 1 hour to give desired hexaarylpyrrolopyrrole (compound 2) as a yellow solid (4.98 g, 6.11 mmol, 61%) (Figure 8D) (Note 35).\nFigure 8.

            "A. CyanH (N-cyclohexyl-2,6-diisopropylaniline) (1). An oven-dried, 1-L 3-necked round-bottomed flask (central neck 29/32 joint, side necks 15/25 joint) is equipped with a 4.5 cm x 2 cm Teflon-coated stir bar. One side neck is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum with argon inlet and outlet needles, and the other is fitted with a 100-mL addition funnel (15/25 joint). The central neck is fitted with a 29/42 rubber septum (Figure 1). After the substitution of the gas by an argon flow, the rubber septum is removed from the central neck of the flask. NaBH4 (17.5 g, 463 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 2) and 1,2-dichloroethane (300 mL, 0.5 M) (Note 3) are added through the central neck (Figure 2A). Then, the central neck is fitted with the 29/42 rubber septum again. The white cloudy suspension is cooled to 0 \u00b0C in an ice-water bath for 10 min. Acetic acid (80 mL, 1400 mmol, 9.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added to the mixture via addition funnel over 25 min with vigorous H2 gas evolution (Figure 2B). After the H2 evolution ceases, the resulting white cloudy suspension is stirred for an additional 30 min at 0 \u00b0C. 2,6-Diisopropylaniline (29 mL, 154 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added dropwise via addition funnel over 5 min, followed by the addition of cyclohexanone (32 mL, 308 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 6) dropwise via addition funnel over 5 min. The addition funnel is replaced with a 15/25 rubber septum (Figure 2C). The resulting white cloudy solution is placed in a pre-heated 35 \u00b0C oil bath and is stirred for 40 h (500 rpm) (Note 7).\nFigure 1. Reaction set-up photo (photo provided by checkers)\nFigure 2. Reaction after addition of A) sodium borohydride, B) acetic acid, and C) 2,6-diisopropylaniline and cyclohexanone and removal of the addition funnel (photos provided by checkers)\n\nA 2.5 M aqueous NaOH solution (400 mL) (Note 8) is slowly added to the reaction flask, which warms upon quenching over 10 min (Figure 3). The mixture is stirred for an additional 10 min. The warm mixture is then cooled in an ice-water bath for 30 min and subsequently transferred to a 1- L separatory funnel, and the reaction vessel is rinsed with EtOAc and water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The 1,2-dichloroethane and EtOAc layers are combined, washed with brine (250 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (70 g) (Note 9), filtered through a glass funnel equipped with cotton and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to provide 49.2 g of crude material as a viscous light pink oil (Figure 4). The product is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (Note 10) using 5% EtOAc in hexane as eluent (Note 11). The fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to provide CyanH (1) as white crystals (21.8 g, 55%) (Note 12) (Figure 5).\nFigure 3.

N,N-Dibenzyl-3-methylbutanamide (2). To an oven-dried 300-mL round-bottomed flask (29/42 joint) equipped with a 4.5 cm x 2 cm Teflon-coated stir bar and a 29/42 rubber septum with argon inlet and outlet needles (Figure 6) are added isovaleryl chloride (2.6 mL, 21 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 13) and anhydrous diethyl ether (100 mL, 0.2 M) (Note 14) by a syringe through the rubber septum. The reaction vessel is moved to a 0 \u00b0C ice-water bath and stirred for 10 min. Triethylamine (8.9 mL, 64 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 15) is added to the mixture by a syringe through the rubber septum over 3 min, resulting in a cloudy white suspension (Figure 7A). To the mixture is added dibenzylamine (Note 16) (4.5 mL, 23 mmol, 1.1 equiv) dropwise by a syringe through the rubber septum over 5 min, and the reaction is stirred for an additional hour at 0 \u00b0C (Note 17) (Figure 7B).\nFigure 6. Reaction set-up (photo provided by checkers)\n\nFigure 7. Reaction after addition of A) triethylamine and B) dibenzylamine (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe reaction is quenched at 0 \u00b0C by the addition of a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (100 mL) over 5 min (Note 18). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 100 mL), and the combined organic extracts are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (30 g), filtered through a glass funnel fitted with a cotton plug and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to provide 6.5 g of a light yellow cloudy oil (Figure 8A). The product is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (Note 10) using 13% EtOAc in hexane as eluent (Note 19). The fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to afford N,N-dibenzyl-3-methylbutanamide (2) as a light yellow oil (5.6 g, 94%) (Note 20) (Figure 8B).\nFigure 8. A) Crude material as a light yellow cloudy oil. B) Dried product 2 (photos provided by checkers)\n\nC. N,N-Dibenzyl-3-methylbut-2-enamide (3). An oven-dried, 1-L 3-necked round-bottomed flask (central neck 29/32 joint, side necks 15/25 joint) is equipped with a 4.5 cm x 2 cm Teflon-coated stir bar. One side neck is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum, and the other is fitted with a 50-mL addition funnel (15/25 joint), which is topped with a 15/25 rubber septum. The central neck is equipped with a connecting adapter (upper outer joint 15/25, lower inner joint 29/42) and a water-cooled reflux Dimroth condenser (15/25 joint), which is topped with a 15/25 three-way stopcock connected to an argon inlet and a vacuum line. All junctures of the glassware and the rubber septa are sealed with silicone grease and Teflon tape. The rubber septum of the side neck of the flask is removed, and CyanH (1) (6.5 g, 25 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 21) is added through the side neck. The rubber septum is reattached and sealed with Teflon tape. The flask is connected to the vacuum line for 2 min, after which the flask is backfilled with argon. This substitution of the gas is repeated three times (Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Reaction set up after addition of CyanH (1) (photo provided by checkers)\n\nTetrahydrofuran (THF, 250 mL, 0.1 M) (Note 22) is added to the flask by a syringe through a rubber septum on the side neck. The clear colorless solution is cooled to -45 \u00b0C (dry ice in acetonitrile) (Figure 10A) for 1 h. To the solution is added n-butyllithium (9.2 mL of 2.6 M in hexane (checker), 24 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 23) dropwise by a syringe through a rubber septum over 5 min, resulting in a light yellow heterogeneous mixture (Figure 10B). The mixture is stirred for an additional 1.5 h at -45 \u00b0C. To the mixture is added a solution of N,N-dibenzyl-3-methylbutanamide (2) (5.4 g, 19 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 24) in THF (50 mL, 0.4 M) dropwise via addition funnel over 15 min. The reaction vessel is moved to a 0 \u00b0C ice-water bath and stirred for 30 min, resulting in an orange homogeneous solution (Figure 10C).\nTo an oven-dried 100-mL round-bottomed flask (15/25 joint), equipped with a 2.0 x 0.9 cm Teflon-coated stir bar, is added ZnBr2 (8.6 g, 38 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 25). The neck of flask is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum with argon inlet and outlet needles. THF (40 mL, 1.0 M) is added to the flask by a syringe through the rubber septum over 1 minute. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until complete dissolution of ZnBr2 resulting in a clear, colorless solution. This ZnBr2 solution is then transferred to the addition funnel by a syringe through the rubber septum and added to the reaction mixture via addition funnel over 5 min. The reaction is stirred for an additional 30 min at 0 \u00b0C, resulting in a light yellow homogeneous solution (Figure 10D).\nTo an oven-dried 100-mL round-bottomed flask (15/25 joint), equipped with a 2.0 x 0.9 cm Teflon-coated stir bar, is added NiBr2(dme) (590 mg, 1.9 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 26). The neck of the flask is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum with argon inlet and outlet needles. THF (40 mL, 0.6 M) and diethyl allyl phosphate (4.1 mL, 23 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 27) are added to the flask via syringe over 1 min, resulting in a deep purple homogeneous solution (Figure 10E). This solution is stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then transferred to the addition funnel by a syringe through the rubber septum (Note 28). The solution is subsequently added to the reaction mixture via addition funnel over 5 min. The reaction vessel is then placed in a pre-heated 80 \u00b0C oil bath and stirred at reflux for 4 h (Figure 10F) (Note 29).\nFigure 10.

F) Reaction mixture during reflux (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe reaction vessel is removed from the oil bath and allowed to return to room temperature over 30 min. The reaction is then quenched by the addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl (500 mL) over 3 min. The quenched reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and the reaction vessel is rinsed with EtOAc. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 x 250 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (250 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (50 g), filtered through a glass funnel equipped with cotton, and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to provide 13 g of crude material as a viscous orange oil. The product is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (Note 10) using a gradient of 7% EtOAc in hexane to 15% EtOAc in hexane as eluent (Note 30). The fractions containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (100 mmHg, 36 \u00b0C) by rotary evaporation to afford N,N-dibenzyl-3-methylbut-2-enamide (3) as a slightly yellow solid (4.8 g, 89%) (Note 31) (Figure 11).\nFigure 11.

            "A. 1-Adamantyl acetate (2). A 100 mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated stir bar (25 mm \u00d7 12 mm, oval) is charged sequentially with 1-adamantanol (15.21 g, 100 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 2), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (1.22 g, 10.0 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 3), pyridine (20 mL) (Note 4) and acetic anhydride (14.2 mL, 15.3 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Notes 5 and 6). The flask is fitted with an air-cooled condenser, the top of which is open to air with a 22-gauge needle (Figure 1). The flask is then lowered into an oil bath pre-heated to 60-70 \u00b0C (as measured with a thermocouple) and is stirred (500 rpm) at that temperature for 20 h (Note 7). The initial colorless suspension becomes a light-yellow solution after ca 10 min and an orange/red solution after 20 h (Figure 1A-C).\nFigure 1. Step A reaction mixture after heating at 60 \u00b0C for A) 1 min, B) 10 min, C) 20 h (photo provided by checkers)\n\nThe flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool in the air until the internal temperature reaches 23-27 \u00b0C, as measured with a thermometer. Stirring (500 rpm) is maintained as diethyl ether (30 mL) (Note 8) is added to the reaction flask. The resulting orange/red solution is poured into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a Teflon-coated stir bar (40 mm \u00d7 10 mm, rod) and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (200 mL) (Note 9). Diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 30 mL) is used to transfer all material from the reaction flask to the Erlenmeyer flask. The biphasic mixture is stirred (300 rpm) for 5 min to control the rate of effervescence; the stirring rate is then increased to 750 rpm (5 min) and finally 1400 rpm until effervescence is no longer observed (ca 5 min). The biphasic mixture is poured into a 500 mL separatory funnel, the organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The combined organic layers are returned to the separatory funnel and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate (3 \u00d7 50 mL) (Notes 10 and 11). The organic layer is transferred to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask and anhydrous sodium sulfate (10 g) (Note 12) is added. After swirling for 20 s, the suspension is vacuum-filtered through a fritted glass funnel (70 mm diameter sinter, medium porosity) into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Diethyl ether (2 \u00d7 20 mL) is used to wash the Erlenmeyer flask and filter cake. The yellow/green filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 525-75 mmHg) to give a green liquid which solidifies on standing (Figure 2a) (Note 13). This material is transferred to a 50 mL kugelrohr distillation flask (B14 joint) using a glass Pasteur pipette (Note 14). The distillation flask is attached to a kugelrohr apparatus via two 50 mL receiver bulbs (B14 joints at both ends); the distillation flask and first receiver bulb are positioned within the kugelrohr oven, and the second receiver bulb is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath. Rotation is started (20 rpm) and the apparatus is gradually evacuated to between 2-5\u00d710-2 mmHg via a vacuum manifold. The crude material is distilled by heating the oven to 80 \u00b0C (30 min) and then to 85 \u00b0C (15 min) while maintaining the pressure between 2-5\u00d710-2 mmHg. The distillate is collected in the final, cooled bulb as an off-white liquid that quickly solidifies (Figure 2b). Once distillation is complete, the apparatus is returned to atmospheric pressure, and the purified material is transferred to a pre-weighed storage vial by gentle warming with a heat gun, giving 1-adamantyl acetate 2 (17.35-17.55 g, 89.3-90.3 mmol, 89.4-90.4%, >99% purity) as a low melting solid (Figure 2b,c) (Notes 14, 15 and 16).\nFigure 2.

            "B. Di-(1-adamantyl)phosphonium trifluoromethanesulfonate (3). Both chambers of a 400 mL CO-ware reactor (Notes 17 and 18) are equipped with Teflon-coated stir bars (19 mm \u00d7 10 mm, oval) (Figure 3). Chamber A is charged with zinc phosphide (78% pure, 10.0 mmol, 3.32 g, 0.5 equiv) (Note 19), and chamber B is charged with 1-adamantyl acetate 2 (11.73 g, 60.0 mmol, 3 equiv) (Notes 14 and 20). Both necks of the reactor are fitted with CO-ware PTFE-faced silicone septa (Note 21), PTFE stabilizing disks (Note 22), and screw-on lids; a 22-gauge needle (Note 23) connected via Luer lock adapter to a Schlenk line is inserted through the septum on chamber B (Note 24).\nFigure 3. CO-ware reactor for step B with chambers labelled, after charging with zinc phosphide (chamber A) and 1-adamantyl acetate (chamber B) (photo provided by submitters)\n\nThe reactor is evacuated (1 x 10-2 mmHg) (Note 25) and backfilled with anhydrous dinitrogen (3 cycles). Anhydrous, degassed dichloromethane (40 mL) (Note 26) is added to chamber B by syringe (22-gauge needle), and degassed deionised water (20 mL) (Note 27) is added to chamber A by syringe (22-gauge needle). The nitrogen inlet needle is removed from chamber B, rendering the CO-ware reactor a sealed system. Both chambers of the reactor are then cooled to -78 \u00b0C (dry ice/acetone bath) without stirring, until the water in chamber A is frozen solid (Note 28). Stirring is commenced (750 rpm), then trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (3.62 mL, 4.44 g, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 29) is added to chamber B by syringe (22-gauge needle) in a single portion. The reactor is removed from the cooling bath and 10 M aqueous HCl (20 mL, 200 mmol, 10 equiv) (Notes 30 and 31) is added immediately to chamber A by syringe (22-gauge needle) in a single portion (Note 28). Stirring is maintained (750 rpm) as both chambers of the reactor are warmed in a water bath set to 50 \u00b0C (as measured by thermocouple); effervescence is observed in chamber A as the ice melts and phosphine gas (PH3, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) is generated (Note 32). The mixture is stirred for 4 h at 50 \u00b0C. The reactor is then removed from the heating bath and cooled to room temperature with stirring.\nThe gas scrubber apparatus (Figure 4) consists of three 50 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flasks (primary neck: B24; secondary neck: B14). Flask 1 is empty, its primary neck is fitted with a rubber septum, and its secondary neck is fitted with an inlet adapter connected by PVC tubing to a Luer lock adapter fitted with a needle (22-gauge, 12 cm). The inlet adapter is secured in the secondary neck of flask 1 with a Keck clip. Flasks 2 and 3 are assembled as flask 1, but contain commercial concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution (30 mL; 10-14% w/w); their primary necks are fitted with rubber septa and the secondary neck of flask 3 is left open to air. The needle leading from flask 1 is inserted through the septum of flask 2 so that it reaches to the bottom of the sodium hypochlorite solution; the needle leading from flask 2 is inserted through the septum of flask 3 so that it reaches to the bottom of the sodium hypochlorite solution. A cannula is constructed from PVC tubing fitted with Luer lock adapters at each end; both Luer lock adapters are fitted with needles (22-gauge, 12 cm) (Figure 4b). Needle 1 of the cannula is inserted through the septum of flask A, and the scrubber system is purged with dinitrogen via needle 2 of the cannula for 10 min (Notes 34 and 35).\nNeedle 2 of the cannula is then inserted into chamber B of the CO-ware reactor, so that the gas released from the CO-ware reactor passes through the scrubber system. After the initial gas release has subsided (ca 10 s), a nitrogen inlet needle (Note 36) is inserted into chamber A of the CO-ware reactor and the entire system is flushed with nitrogen (Note 37) for 10 min to ensure any residual PH3 is completely purged through the bleach baths. The scrubber system is then disconnected from the CO-ware reactor.\nFigure 4. Gas scrubbing system for step B. A) bleach bubbler setup with flasks labelled, B) PVC tubing cannula (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe solution in chamber B of the CO-ware reactor is transferred by syringe (22-gauge needle) to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask, and dichloromethane (2 x 20 mL portions) is used to ensure complete transfer. The colorless solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 525-75 mmHg) and the colorless phosphonium salt starts to crystallize from the remaining liquid (Note 38). A Teflon-coated stir bar (16 mm, cross) is added to the round-bottomed flask. Diethyl ether (40 mL) (Note 8) is then added in a single portion, and the mixture is stirred (500 rpm) for 15 min until the suspended solid appears completely free flowing. The crystalline solid is collected by vacuum filtration on a fritted glass funnel (30 mm diameter sinter, medium porosity). Diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 20 mL portions) is used to wash the flask and filter cake, then air is drawn through the filter cake for 20 min to give di-(1-adamantyl)phosphonium trifluoromethanesulfonate 3 (8.92 g, 19.7 mmol, 98.5%, >98% purity) as a colorless crystalline solid (Figure 5) (Notes 39, 40, and 41).\nFigure 5.

The neck is fitted with a rubber septum and a needle (22-gauge) connected via Luer lock adapter to a dual-bank Schlenk manifold is inserted into the flask. The vessel is evacuated (2 \u00d7 10-1 mmHg) (Note 25) and backfilled with anhydrous dinitrogen (3 cycles). Anhydrous, degassed dichloromethane (40 mL) (Note 26) is added to the mixture by syringe (22-gauge needle) and stirring (500 rpm) is commenced at room temperature (Figure 6b) (Note 42). 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (2.24 mL, 2.28 g, 15.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 43) is added by syringe (22-gauge needle), affording a colorless solution (Figure 6c), which is stirred (500 rpm) at room temperature for 30 min. Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (3.26 mL, 4.00 g, 18.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 29) is added by syringe (22-gauge needle) and the resulting colorless solution (Figure 6d) is stirred (500 rpm) for 24 h at room temperature.\nFigure 6.

            "A. 1-(1-Benzyl-5-iodo-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pent-4-en-1-one (2). A 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.2 cm long oval stir bar is charged with 1-(5-iodo-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pent-4-en-1-one (1) (14.00 g, 50.71 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) followed by DMF (100 mL) (Note 3). The flask is capped with a rubber septum and the resulting, orange-colored solution is magnetically stirred (500 rpm) and cooled to 0 \u00b0C using an ice bath. Potassium carbonate (10.51 g, 76.06 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 4) is added in one portion followed by the addition of benzyl bromide (6.3 mL, 53.2 mmol, 1.05 equiv) (Note 5) dropwise using a syringe over a time period of 2 min. The resulting suspension is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 2 h (Figure 1A). Analysis by TLC (Note 6) is performed to ensure that starting material is consumed. After 1 is entirely consumed the reaction mixture is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel. The reaction vessel is sequentially rinsed with H2O (50 mL) (Note 7) and EtOAc (50 mL) (Note 8), both of which are transferred to the separatory funnel. Additional H2O (250 mL) and EtOAc (250 mL) are added to the separatory funnel. After mixing, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with EtOAc (2 x 200 mL) (Figure 1B). The combined organic phases are sequentially washed with water (2 x 300 mL) and a saturated aqueous NaCl solution (300 mL). The organic layer is dried with MgSO4 (40 g) (Note 9), filtered through a fluted filter paper into a 1 L round-bottomed flask using a glass funnel (Note 10), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 180 to 15 mmHg) (Note 11). The product is purified by crystallization by dissolving the solid in a minimal amount of EtOAc (100 mL) (Notes 12 and 13) on a gently boiling water bath. To the boiling hot solution is added, in portions, n-hexane (80 mL) (Note 14) to the point where the white precipitate that forms upon addition slowly disappears. The flask is then covered with a plastic cap, sealed with Parafilm, and the solution is allowed to cool to 24 \u00b0C on the bench and then at 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator for 18 h (Figure 1C). The obtained solid is vacuum filtered through a round filter paper (\u00f8 = 9 cm) using a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with a minimum amount of cold (4 \u00b0C) EtOAc/n-hexane 1:1 (approx. 20 mL) and then cold (4 \u00b0C) n-hexane (2 x 20 mL) (Note 15). The mother liquor is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 280 to 15 mmHg) and the remaining residue is crystallized as described above using a smaller solvent volume to obtain a second crop of material. The combined solids are dried under high vacuum (24 \u00b0C, 2 x 10-2 mm Hg) at 24 \u00b0C for 18 h to give 13.0 g (35.5 mmol, 70%) of 2 as an off-white solid (Notes 16, 17, and 18) (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1.

            "B. 1-Benzyl-7-methylene-1,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4H-benzo[d]imidazol-4-one (3). A 500 mL beaker (\u00f8 = 7 cm, h = 9 cm) (Note 19) equipped with a triangular prism-shaped stir bar (50 x 12 mm) is charged with tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (52.82 g, 163.84 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 20) and tetra-n-butylammonium acetate (24.70 g, 81.92 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 21). The flask is submerged in an oil bath preheated to 130 \u00b0C (Figure 2A). The salts are magnetically stirred (270 rpm) until a pale-yellow, homogenous melt is obtained (approximately 30 min) (Figure 2B) (Note 22). Then Pd(OAc)2 (220.7 mg, 0.98 mmol, 0.03 equiv) (Note 23) is added in one portion to the melt (Note 24). The mixture is stirred for 1 min (Note 25), whereupon 1-(1-benzyl-5-iodo-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pent-4-en-1-one (2) (12.00 g, 32.77 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added slowly but continuously in one portion to the melt (Notes 24 and 26).\nThe resulting dark brown melt (Figure 2C) is magnetically stirred (270 rpm) for 5-10 min, at which time TLC monitoring shows complete consumption of the starting material (Note 27). The reaction is stopped by pouring the hot melt into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask that contains a mixture of EtOAc and water (300 mL each) and is equipped with a 5 cm long stir bar that is magnetically stirred (500 rpm) at 24 \u00b0C (Note 28) (Figure 2D). Complete transfer is assured by repeatedly rinsing the reaction vessel with EtOAc and H2O from a squirt bottle. The phases are vigorously stirred for 5 min and then filtered through a firmly packed pad (2 cm) of Celite (Note 29) in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (\u00f8 = 10 cm, h = 15 cm; Porosity 4). (Figure 2E).\nFigure 2: (A) The mixture of (n-Bu)4NOAc and (n-Bu)4NBr immediately after being immersed in the oil bath; (B) Appearance of the two salts after they have completely melted; (C) Appearance of the melt after adding Pd(OAc)2 and 2; (D) Hot melt being poured into a stirring mixture of EtOAc and H2O at 24 \u00b0C; (E) Filtration of the two phases through a pad of Celite using a sintered glass funnel (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe Celite pad is washed with additional EtOAc (400 mL), and the phases are transferred into a 1 L separatory funnel and separated. The organic phase is washed with H2O (6 x 200 mL) (Figure 3A) until TLC monitoring showed no remaining tetrabutylammonium salts in the organic layer (Notes 30, 31 and 32). The organic phase is then washed with 1 M aqueous NaOH (10 x 50 mL) (Figure 3B and 3C) (Note 33 and 34) followed by a final wash with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (200 mL). The organic phase is transferred into a 1 L round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.2 cm long oval stir bar and capped with a rubber septum. To this red solution is added activated carbon (1.0 g) (Note 35). The mixture is stirred (500 rpm) at 24 \u00b0C for 18 h and afterwards filtered through a firmly packed (2 cm) pad of Celite (Figure 3D) (Note 36) in a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (\u00f8 = 10 cm, h = 15 cm; Porosity 4). This Celite pad is washed with EtOAc (400 mL) and the obtained pale, yellow-colored solution is concentrated to roughly half its volume on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 120 mmHg). To this solution is added n-hexane (400 mL), whereupon the product precipitates (Figure 3E) (Note 37). The resultant suspension is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 225 to 15 mmHg) to dryness (Note 38). The yellow solid is transferred into a sintered glass B\u00fcchner funnel (\u00f8 = 6 cm, h = 6 cm; Porosity 4) (Figure 3F) (Note 39), thoroughly washed with n-hexane (500 mL) at 24 \u00b0C (Note 40), and dried under high vacuum (24 \u00b0C, 2 x 10-2 mmHg) for 18 h. Imidazole 3 (4.3 g, 18.1 mmol, 55%) is obtained as a tan-colored solid (Figure 4) (Notes 18, 41 and 42). An aromatic by-product is also produced in the reaction (Note 43).\nFigure 3.

            "2,2-Diphenylcycloheptanone (2). A three-necked 300-mL round-bottomed flask (central neck 29/32 joint, side necks 15/25 joint), equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (4.0 x 0.7 cm, rod-shaped) (Note 2) is charged with 1.0 g of scandium(III) triflate (Sc(OTf)3, 2.0 mmol, 5.6 mol%) (Note 3) directly in air. One side neck and the central neck of the reaction vessel are then fitted with glass stoppers. The other side neck is fitted with a short-path distillation head (15/25 upper outer joint, 15/25 lower inner joint, 15/25 side inner joint). While the distillation head is topped with a 15/25 three-way cock connected to an argon inlet and a vacuum line, its branch is fitted with a single-necked 25-mL round-bottomed flask (15/25 joint) charged with 2.00 g of phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5) (Note 4) to absorb the water of hydrated Sc(OTf)3. All joints are sealed with grease and Teflon tape (Figure 1A). After the entire apparatus is evacuated to 0.30 mmHg through the vacuum line, the flask is immersed in a silicone oil bath pre-heated to 150 \u00b0C. Keeping the reduced pressure below 0.30 mmHg, the catalyst powder is stirred at 150 \u00b0C for 12 h (Figures 1B and 1C). In the course of the drying, the formerly free-flowing white phosphorous pentoxide powder (Figure 1D) turns to a sticky white-pink solid containing phosphoric acid residues (Figure 1E).\nFigure 1. (A) Set-up for drying commercial Sc(OTf)3 under a vacuum (150 \u00b0C, 0.30 mmHg); (B) Sc(OTf)3 before drying; (C) Sc(OTf)3 dried under a vacuum (150 \u00b0C, 0.30 mmHg) for 12 hours; (D) Phosphorous pentoxide before drying Sc(OTf)3; (E) Phosphorous pentoxide after drying Sc(OTf)3 (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe assembly is next removed from the silicone oil bath, allowed to cool to 24 \u00b0C over the course of 20 min, and backfilled with argon. The distillation head is removed from the side-neck of the 300-mL flask, which is quickly fitted with a 15/25 three-way stopcock connected to an argon inlet and a vacuum line. Under argon flow, the two glass stoppers are removed from the flask. The uncapped side neck is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum, and the central neck is fitted with a connecting adapter (upper outer joint 19/38, lower inner joint 29/32) and a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, bearing an outer extra chamber for cooling (Note 5), which is topped with a 15/25 rubber septum. All junctures of the glassware are sealed with grease and Teflon tape. The flask is evacuated through the vacuum line (1.5 mmHg, 24 \u00b0C) for 1 min, after which the flask is backfilled with argon. This substitution of the gas is repeated three times. Then, the vacuum line is removed from the three-way cock, which is then connected to an argon outlet. Argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction under a continuous argon flow. The assembly is positioned over a magnetic stir plate in a fume hood. (Figure 2A).\nFigure 2. (A) Reaction set-up; (B) Reaction mixture after addition of toluene; (C) Reaction mixture after addition of cyclohexanone (photos provided by checkers)\n\nTo the flask is added toluene (32 mL to generate a 1.1 M solution) (Note 6) by a syringe through the rubber septum on the side neck. After suspending the catalyst in toluene (Figure 2B), 4.20 mL of cyclohexanone (3.98 g, 40.6 mmol, 1.13 equiv) (Note 7) is added by a syringe through the same rubber septum. The reaction mixture immediately turns from a white suspension to a pale yellow, homogeneous solution (Figure 2C). Then, the rubber septum on the top of the pressure-equalizing addition funnel is removed. In a separate single-necked 100-mL round-bottomed flask, 7.00 g of bright red diphenyldiazomethane (1, 36.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 8) is dissolved in heptane (40 mL to generate a 0.90 M solution) (Note 9) at 0 \u00b0C, and the solution is transferred to the pressure-equalizing addition funnel using a 10-mL glass pipette. The rubber septum is reattached on the top of the funnel and sealed with Teflon tape. The solution inside the addition funnel, which is continuously cooled to 0 \u00b0C (Note 5) and shielded from light by aluminum foil, is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 3 h at 24 \u00b0C (Notes 10 and 11) (Figure 3A). After the complete addition of the diazoalkane, the solution is allowed to stir for 3 h. The reaction mixture is light yellow in color but contains a brown, oily precipitate comprised of deactivated Sc(III) salts (Note 12) (Figure 3B).\nFigure 3. (A) Diazoalkane addition to a solution of Sc(OTf)3 and substrate using a pressure-equalizing addition funnel; (B) The reaction mixture at the end of diazoalkane addition (photos provided by the checkers)\n\nAfter the addition funnel and the three-way stopcock are removed, the heterogeneous mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (30 mL) (Note 13). The stir bar is removed, and the resulting reaction mixture is transferred to a 300-mL separation funnel. Additional diethyl ether (15 mL) is used to wash the flask. The resultant mixture is then washed with pure water (100 mL) (Note 14) (Figure 4A). The pale brown organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (30 mL). The organic layers are combined into a 300-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dried over sodium sulfate (80 g) (Note 15) for 10 min (Figure 4B). The drying agent is filtered through a plastic funnel with a cotton plug into a 300-mL round-bottomed flask and rinsed with diethyl ether (2 x 5 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (38 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg) and dried on a high vacuum (room temperature, 1.5 mmHg) for 10 min.

An oven-dried, 250 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a 25 x 15 mm Teflon-coated oval magnetic stir bar, a thermometer, rubber septum and a Liebig reflux condenser, is connected to a Schlenk line (Note 2). Sodium hydride (NaH) (3.00 g, 75.0 mmol, 3.0 equiv) (Note 3) is charged to the reaction vessel, after which it is evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. Anhydrous THF (Note 4) (35 mL) is added via a syringe. The reaction flask is suspended in a 22 \u00b0C water bath, and lithium iodide (LiI) (6.69 g, 50.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 5) is introduced through the top of the reflux condenser, after which the Ar line is reintroduced with an out needle in place for 5 min to exchange the atmosphere. The addition of LiI to the reaction mixture resulted in an exotherm which causes the internal temperature to rise to 35 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 25 \u2103 under Ar atmosphere while stirring (Note 6), at which time n-butylamine (2) (5.00 mL, 50.6 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 7) is added to the grey suspension in one portion using a syringe.

A 50 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel (14/23 joint) equipped with a CaCl2 tube is attached to the round-bottomed flask and is then charged with chlorosulfonic acid (10.5 mL, 159 mmol, 1.06 equiv) (Note 4) using a 20 mL glass luer-lock syringe. The flask is immersed in an ice/water bath and the solution is stirred for 5 min. The chlorosulfonic acid is added dropwise over 30 min, allowing the fumes to escape. A white precipitate is formed during the addition. Once the addition is complete, the reaction is stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 20 min and left to warm slowly to room temperature over 30 min (Note 5). Once at room temperature, the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h. The resulting mixture is filtered through a 70 mm diameter Number 3 Glass filter funnel with a B\u00fcchner setup. A bent spatula and methanol (25 mL) (Note 6) are used to remove remaining product from the flask walls. The mixture in the filter funnel is triturated with methanol (40 mL, then 2 \u00d7 20 mL) (Note 6), using a spatula to break up the lumps each time. The resulting white solid is broken up into a coarse powder and transferred to a 100 mL round-bottomed flask (29/32 joint), where it is placed on a rotary evaporator (40 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg pressure) for 1 h. The resulting white solid is ground to a fine white powder using a 10 cm diameterglass mortar and pestle, retransferred to a 100 mL round-bottomedflask and dried on a high vacuum line (25 \u00b0C, 0.1 mmHg pressure) for 2 h giving the title compound 1 (20.72 g, 134 mmol, 89% yield) (Note 7) as a fine white powder.\nFigure 1.

The neck of the addition funnel is sealed with a rubber septum, the system is purged with a nitrogen flow for 5 min, and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained via a needle inserted into the septum. The KOH solution is added dropwise to the carbon disulfide solution in the round-bottomed flask over 30 min at room temperature to give a yellow solution. The addition funnel is replaced by a reflux condenser sealed with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen is provided by a needle inserted through the septum. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux in an aluminum heating block (70 \u00b0C) for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere and allowed to cool to room temperature slowly to give a fluffy white precipitate in the solution, which is further cooled to 0 \u00b0C with an ice/water bath for 15 min.\nThe mixture is filtered using a 70 mm diameter Number 3 glass filter funnel with a B\u00fcchner setup.

            "The low-valent titanium-mediated cyclopropanation (the Kulinkovich reaction; eq 1) of esters provides easy access to 1,2-cis-alkylcyclopropanols, complementing the venerable Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation of silylenol ethers or derivatives.\nThe original Organic Syntheses article describes a convenient variant by making use of cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl Grignard reagents as a sacrificial reagent in the presence of a titanium alkoxide (eq 2). Juxtaposition of a strained three-membered ring and a hydroxyl functionality makes cyclopropanols well suited for subsequent elaboration, especially in carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. The Kulinkovich reaction has been the subject of several reviews, including two recent articles.2,3 In light of these reviews, this discussion addendum presents a brief overview of selected developments in the Kulinkovich cyclopropanation with particular emphasis on ring opening of functionalized cyclopropanols in C\u2013C bond forming reactions, including applications in natural product synthesis. Also briefly discussed are related uses of in situ generated Kulinkovich intermediates (titanacyclopropanes). These examples underscore the synthetic utility of cyclopropanols as a family of attractively functionalized, yet readily accessible homologous enol equivalents.\nUseful Developments in the Kulinkovich Cyclopropanation\n\nEnantioselective approaches to the Kulinkovich reaction of esters were documented in the literature by employing TADDOL derivatives, but generally applicable asymmetric methods, especially for the olefin-exchange mediated variant, remain a missing link.4,5 Satisfactory levels of diastereoselective cyclopropanation reactions are possible by employing 1-alkenes having a suitable adjacent stereocenter6 or secondary homoallylic alcohols (Figure 1).7 The directing effect of the hydroxyl group in the latter substrates leads to the formation of 1,2-trans-alkylcyclopropanols via seven-membered cyclic titanates to override the intrinsic cis-alkyl stereochemical preference of the original Kulinkovich cyclopropanation.\nFigure 1. Enantioselective and diastereoselective approaches\nOther carboxylic acid derivatives (such as tertiary amides, cyclic carbonates, and nitriles) also undergo the Kulinkovich reactions to afford the corresponding heteroatom-substituted cyclopropanes (Figure 2).2,3 In the case of nitriles, the use of homoallylic alcohols is required for the olefin exchange-mediated variant to countermand stronger affinity of a nitrile toward low-valent titanium species.8a-c,9 On the other hand, imides and N-acylpyrroles having a non-basic nitrogen instead produce the titanacyclopentanes, arising from preferential addition of the less substituted Ti\u2013C bond of the presumed Kulinkovich intermediate to the respective carbonyl group.8d\nFigure 2. The Kulinkovich cyclopropanation of carboxylic acid derivatives and related coupling reactions\nRing Opening of Cyclopropanols\n\nCyclopropanols function as a homoenol surrogate in C\u2013C bond forming reactions driven by release of ring strain. A notable exception notwithstanding,10 ring opening reactions of cyclopropanols were limited primarily to non-carbon electrophiles (e.g., halogens) until recently. Electrophilic attack at cyclopropanols by tethered oxocarbenium ions provides a unique approach to common structural motifs such as appropriately functionalized carbocycles (Figure 3),11 oxepanes12 and tetrahydropyrans (Figure 4).13\nFigure 3. Seven-membered ring formation\nFigure 4. Cyclopropanol-mediated synthesis of oxepanes and tetrahydropyrans\nThe temporary tethering strategy with the homoallylic alcohol functionality is not only effective for the aforementioned cyclopropanation (Figures 1 and 3), but also broadly applicable to coupling of two unsaturated fragments (such as alkynes and imines) by the action of the Kulinkovich intermediate, as elegantly developed by the Micalizio group (Figure 5).14\nFigure 5. Coupling of homoallylic alcohols with alkynes and imine\nAllylic alcohols are also versatile substrates that readily react with the ethyl Grignard reagent-derived Kulinkovich intermediate to afford syn-SN2'-type ethylation products, accompanied by elimination of a \"Ti=O\" moiety (Figure 6).15a Importantly, the presumed intermediates can be trapped with suitable electrophiles such as aldehydes, halogens, and molecular oxygen.15b High levels of diastereoselectivity are obtained with cyclic allylic alcohols and (Z)-allylic alcohols. This reaction is reminiscent of the Dzhemilev\u2013Hoveyda reaction, which employs the Negishi reagent in the place of the Kulinkovich reagent.16 An advantage of this method is an efficient trapping with carbon-based electrophiles (e.g., aldehydes). Styrenes and vinylsilanes also undergo coupling with allylic alcohols in the presence of the cyclopentyl Grignard reagent under the typical Kulinkovich reaction conditions (Figure 6).15a\nFigure 6. Stereoselective alkylation of allylic alcohols by ethylation and trapping\nThe corresponding coupling reaction of allylic alcohols with imines results in diastereoselective allylation of aromatic and aliphatic imines to afford homoallylic amines diastereoselectively (Figure 7).17 Direct use of an attractively functionalized allylic alcohol as an allylating reagent without pre-derivatization obviates the use of preformed organometallic reagents or activated imine derivatives.\nFigure 7. Diastereoselective synthesis of homoallylic amines\nBy combining ring opening of cyclopropanols with transmetalation of a suitable transition metal, the otherwise unfavorable equilibrium can be shifted to generate in situ \u03b2-keto homoenolates, which open new avenues to transition metal-catalyzed transformations with sp3, sp2, and sp electrophiles (eq 3). Additionally, the formation of the presumed 5-membered keto chelate intermediate is advantageous in promoting facile reductive elimination (subsequent to transmetalation) in preference to the competing beta-hydride elimination, as well as minimizing epimerization of the alpha-stereocenter.\nTransition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of cyclopropanols for the C\u2013C bond formation have been an active area of research: they include: SN2' alkylation, alkenylation, alkynylation, and acylation (Figure 8), in addition trifluoromethylation and related reactions.3,18\nFigure 8. Transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions\nAs a representative example of this family of transition metal-catalyzed C\u2013C bond forming reactions, alkenylation and acylation reactions of cyclopropanols are described briefly. The Orellana group reported Pd-catalyzed coupling of cyclopropanols with aryl halides, which proceeded cleanly without beta-hydride elimination (Figure 9).19 This methodology is also amenable to intramolecular processes, providing an efficient route to the otherwise challenging medium-sized (seven- and eight-membered) carbocycles.\nFigure 9. Inter- and intramolecular cross-coupling reactions\nof aryl or alkenyl halides and derivatives\nAn efficient construction of seven- and eight-membered carbocycles can be attributed to facile ligand exchange between the Pd species [from oxidative addition of Pd(0)] and the tethered cyclopropanol to set the stage for beta-carbon elimination of the resulting Pd cyclopropoxide, followed by reductive elimination.18d\nThe Dai group developed an elegant carbonylative ring opening reaction of cyclopropanols having a tethered hydroxyl group to synthesize spirocyclic and fused bicyclic lactones of varying ring size (Figure 10).20 The cyclopropanol substrates are readily available by the Kulinkovich cyclopropanation of the corresponding lactones.\nFigure 10. Pd-Catalyzed acylation of cyclopropanols: catalytic carbonylative spirolactonization of hydroxyl-tethered cyclopropanols\nConversion of cyclopropanols to the corresponding cyclopropylamines was achieved by the Rousseaux group by trapping of the presumed zinc homoenolates with amines (Figure 11).21a Zinc homoenolates can also be generated by treatment of alpha-chloroaldehydes with CH2(ZnI)2 by the method of Matsubara.21b These studies demonstrate facile interconversion between zinc cyclopropoxides and the corresponding homoenolates for in situ trapping of the latter intermediates.\nThis Discussion Addendum focuses on regioselective ring opening of cyclopropanols at the unsubstituted carbon. The alternative mode of ring opening relies on generation of beta-keto alkyl radical intermediates. Trapping of the latter has led to a spate of useful transformations. The chemistry of beta-keto radicals has a long rich history, but it is beyond the scope of this Addendum.2,3 Also excluded are vinyl cyclopropanols and donor-acceptor cyclopropanols.\nFigure 11. Conversion of cyclopropanols to cyclopropylamines\nApplication in Natural Product Synthesis\n\nA short total synthesis of paeonilide, a monoterpenoid isolated from Paeonia delavayi, was reported by Dai and coworkers: the fused bicyclic lactone moiety was assembled in an appealing manner by Pd-catalyzed carbonylative lactonization of a highly functionalized cyclopropanol (Figure 12).20b\nFigure 12. Short total synthesis of (\u00b1)-paeonilide\nThe sequential orchestration of the olefin exchange-mediated cyclopropanation and anti-SN2' alkylation of the resulting cyclopropanol with a propargyl tosylate was central to a concise total synthesis of alkaloid 205B containing a deceptively simple array of stereocenters.22 Starting from two easily accessible coupling partners, this alkaloid was synthesized in four straightforward steps (Figure 13). Also noteworthy was uncommon solvent effect (THF vs Et2O)22a in LAH reduction of the six-membered imine intermediate to afford the trans-2,6-disubstituted piperidine stereoselectively.\nFigure 13. Concise synthesis of alkaloid (\u2013)-205B\nIn conclusion, the Kulinkovich cyclopropanation reaction provides ready access to attractively functionalized cyclopropanols. The olefin exchange-mediated variant is a versatile method for coupling of two segments \u2013 esters and terminal alkenes. Cross-coupling reactions of cyclopropanols and appropriate partners allow a rapid increase in molecular complexity through an expedient bond connection under mild conditions and with operational simplicity."

Then the Celite is washed with methanol (800 mL), and the organic layer is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 \u2103, 10 mmHg).

The aqueous phase is transferred to a 500 mL round-bottomed flask that contains a stir bar, chilled to 0 \u2103 in an ice-water bath and neutralized by adding NaHCO3 (sat. aq.) in 5-10 drop increments via a pasture pipette while gently stirring (80 rpm). The pH is monitored after each series of addition using pH paper (Note 43). Once the pH reaches 7.2-7.4, the solution is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel, and the aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 250 mL). The organic layers are combined and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (200 g), decanted, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (starting with 50 mmHg and gradually lowering to 10 mmHg), while maintaining the water bath temperature at 17 \u2103 until the final volume reaches approximately 1-2 mL. The remaining solvent is removed by rotary evaporation at 50 mmHg, leading to rapid precipitation of the amine (Note 44).

An oven-dried 500 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an oven-dried 3 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and oven-dried sodium carbonate (4.00 g, 37.7 mmol, 1.6 equiv) (Note 2). The right neck is fitted with an oven-dried 15/25 glass stopper (Note 3). The left neck is fitted with a 15/25 rubber septum, and the central neck is equipped with a 29/32 three-way cock connected to an argon inlet and a vacuum line. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with argon gas three times. Argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction under argon flow (Figure 1A). Anhydrous toluene (40 mL) (Note 4) and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (CSI) (2.72 mL, 4.42 g, 31.2 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Notes 5 and 6) are added at room temperature (26 \u00b0C) to the 500 mL three-necked round-bottom flask using 60 mL and 6 mL disposable syringes, respectively. The reaction flask is cooled to -78 \u00b0C (bath temperature) in a dry ice and methanol bath within a 1 L Dewar cooling bath (Note 7).\nFigure 1. (A) Reaction set-up; (B) Addition of glucal solution at -78 \u00b0C (photos provided by checkers)\n\nA solution of tri-O-benzyl-D-glucal (2, 10.0 g, 24.0 mmol) (Note 8) in toluene (40 mL) is added via a 60 mL disposable syringe and a syringe pump to the stirring CSI solution in the three-necked round-bottomed flask at -78 \u00b0C. The solution was added dropwise at a rate of 1.5 mL/min (Note 9) (Figure 1B) resulting in a yellow solution. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is warmed to -62 \u00b0C using a constant temperature bath with methanol (Note 10) (Figures 2A and 2B) and stirred for 3 h at this temperature.\nThe reaction mixture is cooled to -78 \u00b0C in dry ice and methanol bath (Figure 2C). Then the reaction mixture is diluted with anhydrous toluene (120 mL: 60 mL x 2) using a 60 mL disposable syringe and syringe pump over 30 min at a rate of 4 mL/min (Figure 2D). Red-Al\u00ae (>60 wt % solution in toluene, 10.9 mL, 7.08 g, 35.0 mmol, 1.46 equiv) (Notes 11 and 12) is added to the three-necked, round-bottomed flask using a 12 mL disposable syringe and syringe pump over 15 min at a rate of 0.6 mL/min (Figure 2E).\nFigure 2.

The solution is warmed to -10 \u00b0C and stirred for 10 min in an ice and acetone bath (Note 13) (Figure 3A). The reaction mixture is effervescing and is slightly yellow at this point. The reaction is quenched by dropwise addition of deionized water (1.0 mL) over one min using a disposable syringe. The resultant mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min while warming up the mixture to 0 \u00b0C (Figure 3B) in ice water and then stirred another 15 min, at which time the solution is at 26 \u00b0C (Figure 3C) (Note 14).\nFigure 3. Raising temperature of reaction solution to (A) -10 \u00b0C; (B) 0 \u00b0C; (C) 26 \u00b0C (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe solution is then filtered via vacuum filtration with a B\u00fcchner funnel and filter paper (Note 15) to remove solids. The solid is washed with ethyl acetate (300 mL), and the filtrate is transferred to a 2 L round-bottomed flask. The resultant solid on the filter paper is transferred to a 500 mL separation funnel using deionized water (200 mL), and ethyl acetate (100 mL) is added to the separation funnel. The aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL x 2), and the organic layers are combined into the above 2 L round-bottomed flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 \u00b0C, from 400 mmHg to 20 mmHg). The residue is transferred to a 500 mL separation funnel using ethyl acetate (200 mL). The organic layers are washed with 1 M HCl solution (200 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (200 mL), and brine (200 mL). The organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate (10 g) to remove residual water, and the drying agent is filtered via vacuum filtration with a B\u00fcchner funnel and filter paper (Note 15) into a 1 L round-bottomed flask. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 \u00b0C, from 400 mmHg to 20 mmHg) to obtain a crude yellow oil (5.10 g).\nThe crude yellow oil is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (150 g) (Note 16) using ethyl acetate and n-hexane as eluents (Note 17). The desired product is obtained in fractions 16-22, combined, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 \u00b0C, from 400 mmHg to 10 mmHg) to yield a colorless oil. The oil is then placed under high vacuum(27\u00b0C, 5 mmHg) for 20 h to afford 3.95 g (36%, 97.9% purity) of (1S,3R,4S,5R,6R)-4,5-Bis(phenylmethoxy)-3-[(phenylmethoxy) methyl]-2-oxa-8-azabicyclo[4.2.0]-octan-7-one (1) as a white solid (Figure 4) (Notes 18, 19 and 20).\nFigure 4.

In air, a three-necked 1000-mL round-bottomed flask (29/32) is charged with an egg-shaped Teflon coated magnetic stir bar (50 \u00d7 17 mm) and aluminium chloride (3.33 g, 25.0 mmol, 0.10 equiv) (Note 2). The central neck of the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser with the outlet passing through a round-bottomed flask (250 mL, 29/32) before entering a Drechsel bottle containing an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (Note 3). Through a side neck, 1,2-difluorobenzene (0.250 L, 285 g, 2.50 mol, 10.0 equiv) (Note 4) is added to the 1000-mL round-bottomed flask. The flask is fitted with an adapter for the nitrogen inlet on the left neck (Note 5) and a 50 mL dropping funnel on the right neck. Disulfur dichloride (20.0 mL, 33.8 g, 0.250 mol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 6) is added to the addition funnel (Figure 1A), and then added drop-wise at room temperature (Note 7) over a period of 10 min to the stirred reaction mixture (Note 8). Upon addition of the disulfur dichloride, the solution becomes black (Figure 1B) and evolves HCl gas. After complete addition of the disulfur dichloride, the reaction mixture is heated at a gentle reflux (105 \u00b0C, bath temp)) using a silicon oil bath (Note 9) for 1 h. The oil bath is then replaced by an ice water bath, and MeOH (200 mL) is added to the reaction mixture via the addition funnel (Note 10). The dark color quickly dissipates from the reaction mixture, resulting in a light yellow suspension with a colorless solid (2,3,7,8-tetrafluorothianthrene) (Figure 1C).\nFigure 1.

The filter cake is washed with chilled methanol (2 \u00d7 50 mL) (Notes 10 and 12), and the resulting off-white solid is transferred into a 500-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (29/32) and dried under vacuum (Note 13) for 18 h at room temperature. The resulting 23.82 g off-white solid (Figure 1D) contained 74.3% of 2,3,7,8-tetrafluorothianthrene by weight (Note 14), which is used without any further purification in the subsequent reaction (Notes 15 and 16).\nIn air, the 500-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (29/32) containing 23.82 g of crude 2,3,7,8-tetrafluorothianthrene (wt% = 74.3%; Note 14) is charged with an egg-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (27 \u00d7 10 mm), DCM (175 mL, c = 0.35 M), Fe(NO3)3 \u2219 9H2O (42.2 g, 105 mmol, 1.7 equiv), NaBr (443 mg, 4.21 mmol, 0.07 equiv), and TFA (6.60 mL, 9.83 g, 86.2 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 17). After addition, the flask is sealed with a rubber septum (Note 18). The resulting light brown suspension (Figure 2B) is stirred at room temperature for 20 h (Note 19).

The filter cake is added to the combined organic layers, and the suspension is concentrated under reduced pressure (525 to 20 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C) (Note 20). MeCN (50 mL) (Note 21) is added to the residue, and the resulting suspension is filtered by vacuum filtration (Note 11). The solid is washed with MeCN (3 \u00d7 25 mL) (Note 12) (Figure 3A), which removes the majority of the red color. The solid is transferred into a 1000-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask. Toluene (600 mL) (Note 22) is added, the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated to reflux (110 \u00b0C) using a silicone oil bath. After 10 min at this temperature, heating and stirring is turned off and the mixture is left in the oil bath for 5 min. Subsequently, the mixture is decanted into a 1000-mL Erlenmeyer flask in order to remove the red-brown solid. Then the toluene solution is allowed to cool down to room temperature for 3 h. The obtained crystals (Figure 3B) are collected by vacuum filtration (Notes 11 and 23), washed with Et2O (2 \u00d7 50 mL) (Notes 12 and 24) (Figure 3C), and transferred into a 500-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask.

The mixture is heated at 60 \u00b0C using a silicone oil bath for 5 min. After this time the mixture is allowed to stand for 5 min. Subsequently, the mixture is decanted into a 1000-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (29/32). The solution is concentrated via rotary evaporator (400 mmHg, 40 \u00b0C). The product is transferred into a 250-mL one-necked, round-bottomed flask (29/32) and recrystallized from toluene (80 mL, 110 \u00b0C) using a silicone oil bath.

The combined batches are recrystallized again from toluene (240 mL, 110 \u00b0C) using a silicone oil bath. After cooling to room temperature for 2 h, the off-white crystals are collected by vacuum filtration (Note 11), washed with Et2O (2 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 12) and ground into a fine powder using a porcelain mortar.

A reflux condenser (14/23 joint) with a rubber septum is attached to the round-bottomed flask, and the system is purged for 5 min with N2, after which a N2-filled balloon is used to seal the system. The mixture is then heated at reflux in an oil bath for 16 h.\nA Number 3 Glass filter funnel connected with a vacuum adaptor to a single-necked 500 mL round-bottomed flask (29/32 joint) is charged with Celite\u00ae (25 g) (Note 5). The Celite\u00ae is wetted with acetonitrile (70 mL) (Note 4) and allowed to settle. Whilst the reaction mixture is still warm, the contents are poured over the Celite\u00ae. Once absorbed, the Celite\u00ae is carefully washed (Note 6) with acetonitrile (300 mL) (Note 4) until the color completely passes to the round-bottomed flask. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg). The resulting solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 7) and transferred to a vial (20 mL). The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg) and the resulting solid is broken up with a spatula and dried on a high vacuum line (0.1 mmHg) for 4 h giving the title compound 1 (1.10 g, 0.84 mmol, 99%) (Note 8) as a fine dark green-black powder.\nFigure 1.

The round-bottomed flask is sealed with a rubber septum and purged with N2 for 5 min, after which a N2-filled balloon is attached to the system. Freshly distilled dichloromethane (20 mL) (Note 7) is added to the mixture, followed by trimethyl orthoformate (1.3 mL, 12 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 10). The resultant mixture is stirred and cooled to -40 \u00b0C with an acetonitrile/liquid N2 bath. Then, triethylsilyl triflate (3.2 mL, 14 mmol, 1.4 equiv) (Note 11) is added and the mixture is stirred for 5 min.

A) Reaction set-up and B) final appearance (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe reaction mixture is quenched with saturated NH4Cl aqueous solution (10 mL), and the mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separating funnel. The round-bottomed flask is washed with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 25 mL) (Note 13), which is then transferred to the separating funnel. Deionized water (2 \u00d7 25 mL) is used to wash the round-bottomed flask and added to the separating funnel. After shaking vigorously, the lower organic layer is collected, and the remaining aqueous layer is further extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 13). The combined organic extracts are dried over MgSO4 (30 g) (Note 14) and filtered into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask (29/32 joint); the remaining MgSO4 (Note 14) is washed with dichloromethane (50 mL) (Note 13) and filtered. The combined filtrates are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (25 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg) to produce a yellow-brown oil.\nThe residue is then submitted to flash column chromatography using a 4.5 cm diameter column with a length of 25 cm of silica gel (60 \u00c5) (Note 15). This is first compacted with 95:5 petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (500 mL) (Note 16), and the surface levelled. The residue is dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) (Note 13) and transferred onto the compacted column with a pipette. The round-bottomed flask is washed with additional dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 2 mL) (Note 13) and the washings added to the column. Once adsorbed, thick sand is added to protect the silica. The column is eluted with a 10/1 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate (ca 2000 mL) (Note 16) until all of the yellow color has left the column and the eluent runs clear. All pure tubes are collected in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg). Neat dichloromethane (2 \u00b4 25 mL) (Note 13) is added and the resultant solution transferred to a vial (20 mL) where it is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35 \u00b0C, 12 mmHg). The resultant solid is kept under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at room temperature for 4 h to afford pure product 2 (2.38 g, 90% yield) as a yellow solid (Note 17).\nFigure 3.

To the flask, MeOH (420 mL) and H2O (4.2 mL) (Note 3) are added using glass graduated cylinders successively, followed by 1-iodooctane (50.0 g, 208 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 37.8 mL) (Note 4) via syringe. The mixture is stirred for 1 min under air at ambient temperature to distribute 1-iodooctane evenly throughout the solution prior to addition of base. To this mixture, t-BuOLi (33.3 g, 416 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added portion-wise under ambient atmosphere. The flask is fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser and clamped above an oil bath on a hot plate/stirrer. Both of the side necks and the reflux condenser are sealed with rubber septa and an N2 inlet connected to a Schlenk line by a needle adaptor is inserted in the reflux condenser septum. The pressure inside the reaction system is reduced to <0.1 mmHg using a vacuum pump, and the atmosphere is refilled with N2 from the balloon. This vacuum-refill cycle is performed three additional times. The flask is lowered into a 50 \u00b0C oil bath and stirred for 56 h (Note 6) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

A white solid precipitates after 2-3 h during stirring, and the conversion is monitored by TLC (Note 7) (Figure 2). Upon completion, the reaction mixture is cooled to 26 \u00b0C and filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 8). The filter cake is washed with n-hexane (20 mL) (Note 9), and the combined filtrate is transferred to a 2-L round-bottomed flask. The combined filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (bath temperature 35 \u00b0C, 40 mmHg) to afford a white residue. To the residue in the 2-L round-bottomed flask, n-heptane (400 mL) is added. The resulting mixture is stirred at 26 \u00b0C for 10 min and filtered. The filtrate is transferred to a 1-L round-bottomed flask charged with a 2.5-cm rod-shaped stir bar and cooled to -50 \u00b0C in a dry ice-ethanol bath (Note 10). The solution is stirred for another 10 min and filtered.

At this point petroleum ether:ethyl acetate (4:1) (1000 mL) is used to elute the product. The eluent is collected in a 2-L beaker until TLC analysis (Note 7) shows that no product (3) is still eluting from the silica gel. Approximately 2000 mL total of eluent is used in this step.\nThe eluent is concentrated by rotary evaporation at 35 \u00b0C (40 mmHg)., and eventually transferred into a 100-mL round-bottomed flask, using petroleum ether (20 mL) to wash the larger flasks. After concentration by rotary evaporation at 35 \u00b0C (40 mmHg) and further drying under high vacuum for 30 min at 26 \u00b0C (0.5 mmHg), product 3 (35 g, 70% isolated yield) is obtained as a colorless oil (Figure 3) (Notes 12, 13, and 14).2\nFigure 3.

Within 1-2 min the reaction begins to effervesce and undergoes a mild exotherm (Note 3) (Figure 2), at which point the heating bath is removed. The addition, which requires about 1.5 h, is adjusted to maintain a gentle reflux without external heating (around 3 drops/second) (Note 4). Stirring is continued for 2 h after the addition is complete. Towards the end of the addition time, a small amount of an insoluble brown resin forms on the walls of the flask (Figure 3).\nFigure 1.

            "Diphenylprolinol silyl ether 3 (Figure 1) is a versatile organocatalyst.2 In 2005, our group reported the asymmetric Michael reaction of aldehydes and nitroalkenes catalyzed by this catalyst 3.3 In 2011, we found that the reaction is greatly accelerated by p-nitrophenol.4 The procedure based on this finding is described in our article of 2017, published in Organic Syntheses.5\nFigure 1. Representative organocatalysts\n\nIn 2005, J\u00f8rgensen and coworkers reported the sulfenylation of aldehydes using diarylprolinol with trifluoromethyl substituents on the phenyl group 4.6 In both Michael and sulfenylation reactions, an enamine, generated from the aldehyde and the catalyst, is a key intermediate (eq. 1). As the enamine is a reactive nucleophile, it reacts with electrophiles to afford \u03b1-functionalized aldehydes with excellent enantioselectivity. This type of catalyst also reacts with an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde to generate an iminium ion (eq. 2). The iminium ion is a reactive electrophile; it reacts with nucleophiles to afford \u03b2-functionalized aldehydes with excellent enantioselectivity.\n\nHere, there are two major catalysts: diphenylprolinol silyl ether 3, and diarylprolinol silyl ether with trifluoromethyl substituents 4 (Figure 1). The difference between these two catalysts is as follows.7 As a trifluoromethyl substituent is a good electron-withdrawing group, the electron density on the nitrogen in catalyst 4 is lower than that on the nitrogen in catalyst 3. The latter is a nucleophilic catalyst and the HOMO level of the enamine generated from catalyst 3 is higher than that generated from catalyst 4. Thus, the reactivity of the enamine generated from 3 is higher than that of the enamine generated from 4. Regarding the iminium ion, on the other hand, the LUMO of the iminium ion generated from 4 is lower than that generated from 3, and the former iminium ion is more electrophilic and reactive.\nThe silyl group is essential for the high reactivity. In the reaction of diphenylprolinol, the reaction is slow. This is because diphenylprolinol reacts with an aldehyde to generate a stable N,O-acetal with low concentration of the reactive enamine (eq. 3). However, we found that diarylprolinol is effective for the cross-aldol reaction of two different aldehydes, in which the hydroxy group of the catalyst is essential for the activation of the electrophilic aldehydes (eq. 4).8\n\nIn both reactions involving the enamine and the iminium ion as an intermediate, excellent enantioselectivity is realized. This could be because of steric effects in the transition state (Figure 2). One of the enantiofaces of the enamine and the iminium ion is effectively shielded by the bulky diarylmethyl silyl ether moiety, facilitating approach of an electrophile or a nucleophile from the opposite side.\nFigure 2. Effect of the silyl moiety\n\nRegarding the silyl substituent, not only can a trimethylsilyl group be utilized, but other silyl groups, such as triethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, and triisopropylsilyl can be used, as well. In general, as the size of the silyl group increases, the generation of the enamine and the iminium ion from the corresponding aldehyde and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde, in the presence of catalyst, becomes slower because of steric hindrance, while the enantioselectivity generally increases.9\nIn our article of 2017, published in Organic Syntheses,5 we reported the asymmetric Michael reaction of propanal and nitrostyrene. Michael product was obtained in excellent yield with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The reaction mechanism revealed that this is not a simple Michael reaction. As shown in Scheme 1,4, 10 the enamine and nitroalkene react via [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition pathways to afford cyclobutane 5 and dihydro-oxazine N-oxide 6, which are stable and can be isolated. Compounds 5 and 6 can be transformed into the Michael product by reaction with water, accelerated by acid, which is why a catalytic amount of acid accelerates the reaction.\nScheme 1. Reaction mechanism of the Michael reaction of propanal and nitrostyrene\n\nRegarding the Michael reaction of aldehydes and nitroalkenes, an aldehyde lacking substitution at the \u03b1-position, such as acetaldehyde, can be successfully employed as a Michael donor, affording the product with excellent enantioselectivity (eq. 5).11\n\nMoreover, not only nitroalkenes but also \u03b2-substituted \u03b1-nitroacrylates,12 dicyanoalkenes,13 and \u03b1-cyano \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters,14 and vinyl sulfones15 can be employed as useful Michael acceptors, using an aldehyde as a Michael donor (eq. 6). In all cases, excellent enantioselectivity is realized.\n\nThere are several applications of the asymmetric Michael reaction of aldehydes and nitroalkenes in the total synthesis of biologically-active molecules. Chemists at Novartis have reported the total synthesis of aliskiren (Rasilez), a novel renin inhibitor, by using the asymmetric Michael reaction of isovaleraldehyde and nitroethene, generated from 2-(benzoyloxy)-1-nitroethane in situ, as one of the key steps (Scheme 2).16\nScheme 2. Michael reaction in the total synthesis of aliskiren (Rasilez) by Novartis\n\nThe Michael reaction of an \u03b1-alkoxy aldehyde and nitroalkene was successfully employed in the pot- and time-economical total synthesis of (-)-oseltamivir (Scheme 3) (one pot, 60 min).17\nScheme 3. Total synthesis of (-)-oseltamivir: one pot, 60 min\n\nDiphenylprolinol silyl ether is a secondary amine catalyst with a bulky substituent, and its basicity is rather low. It activates an aldehyde and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde selectively, but it has no effect in other reactions because it is a weak base. This catalyst is also effective in domino reactions. A domino reaction is a reaction involving two or more bond-forming transformations that take place under the same reaction conditions without the addition of further reagents and catalysts.18 One of the early successful examples is Enders' domino Michael/Michael/aldol condensation reaction of an aldehyde, nitroalkene, and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde, affording substituted cyclohexene derivatives with excellent enantioselectivity (eq. 7).19\n\nThe domino Michael/Henry reaction of succinaldehyde and a nitroalkene was catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether to afford a cyclopentane derivative (Scheme 4).20 This is a formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, successfully used in the three-pot synthesis of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) methyl ether,21 and a short synthesis of beraprost.22\nScheme 4. Synthesis of PGE1 methyl ester\n\nDiphenylprolinol silyl ether was also utilized in the total synthesis of a steroid. A domino Michael/intramolecular aldol reaction of nitroalkane 7 and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde was catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether to afford a bicyclo[4.3.0]nonane derivative 8, which corresponds to the C and D rings of the steroid, with nearly enantiomerically pure form, with the generation of an all-carbon quaternary center (Scheme 5).23 This compound 8 was efficiently converted into estradiol methyl ether.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of estradiol methyl ether\n\nRecently, the Michael reaction of a ketone as a nucleophile was reported, in which use was made of two amine catalysts such as diphenylprolinol silyl ether and hydroxyproline (eq. 8).24 In this reaction, the key nucleophile is an enolate, which is generated from a ketone in the presence of a weak acid and a base (eq. 9).25\n\nBased on this Michael reaction, a domino Michael/Michael reaction of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde and ethyl 4-oxo-2-pentenoate (9) was developed (Scheme 6).26 The catalyst reacts with an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde to generate an iminium ion 10, which reacts with ketone 9 via a Michael reaction to afford an enamine 11. A diastereoselective second Michael reaction proceeds from 11 to afford a substituted cyclopentanone derivative with excellent diastereoselectivity. In this domino double Michael reaction, nearly enantiomerically pure product was obtained. This is because the chiral catalyst is involved in both steps and kinetic resolution occurs in the second Michael reaction. Using this reaction as a key step, Corey lactone was synthesized in a one-pot reaction.\nScheme 6. Synthesis of Corey lactone\n\nIn summary, diphenylprolinol silyl ether is an effective organocatalyst for both the enamine and the iminium ion as reactive intermediate. Using this catalyst, new asymmetric reactions have been reported-chiral complex structures are constructed by a domino reaction.27 Several successful combinations of this organocatalyst and metal catalysts have been reported.28 The combination of a photocatalyst and organocatalyst is a growing field.29 Applications of the asymmetric reaction catalyzed by this catalyst are increasing-natural products and pharmaceuticals are effectively synthesized by this catalyst."

Water (150 mL) is added, and the separatory funnel is shaken, then brine (50 mL) is added and the separatory funnel is gently inverted to assist phase separation.

            "1,1-Difluoroallenes have two fluorine substituents, which are located on the cumulated diene substructure to decisively affect their reactivities. In addition to the reactions compiled in our previous review,2 synthetic reactions of 1,1-difluoroallenes have been continuously investigated since the authors' publication in Org. Synth. that described difluoroallene production by difluorovinylidenation of aldehydes and ketones.3 As a result, the fluorine substituents allow bond-forming reactions of 1,1-difluoroallenes to proceed in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b3-selective fashions, all of which are illustrated below.\nBond Forming Reactions on the \u03b1-Carbon\n\nAs discussed in the original article,3 an In(III) catalyst facilitates the domino Friedel-Crafts-type cyclization/ring expansion sequence of 1,1-difluoroallenes 1. Subsequent one-pot dehydrogenation leads to pinpoint-fluorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2 (F-PAHs, Scheme 1).4 The domino reaction allows two carbon-carbon bond formations, first at the position \u03b1 to the fluorine substituents and subsequently at the \u03b3-position.\nScheme 1. In(III)-catalyzed synthesis of F-PAHs\n\nThree applications were developed using the above domino reaction to construct extended \u03c0 systems, namely, (i) tandem benzene ring construction,5 (ii) \u03c0-extended aryne generation,6 and (iii) benzene ring extension.7 These applications resulted in the successful generation of difluorinated, monofluorinated, and fluorine-free \u03c0-extended molecular systems.\nThe first application of the domino cyclization/ring expansion sequence involves tandem benzene ring construction (Figure 1).5 Bis(1,1-difluoroallene) 3 (a) and 4 (b), prepared from m- and p-xylenes via the corresponding dialdehydes, underwent the domino reaction in a tandem fashion to afford pinpoint-difluorinated dibenzoanthracene 5 and picene 6 in 76% and 75% yields, respectively. The physicochemical features of the synthesized F-PAHs were examined, specifically their solubility in organic solvents8 and their potential as materials for electronic devices.5\nFigure 1. Synthesis of pinpoint-difluorinated PAHs (F-PAHs)\n\nSecondly, the synthesis of \"half HBCs\" was facilitated by \u03c0-extended aryne generation from 1,1-difluoroallenes (Scheme 2).6 The structure of half HBCs is a half section of HBCs (hexabenzocoronenes), which are promising as materials for photovoltaic cells. o-Bromo- or o-iodofluoroarenes 7 were prepared by the In(III)-catalyzed domino reaction of 1,1-difluoroallenes involving halogenation of the C-In bond with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) or N-iodosuccinimide (NIS).4a Compounds 7 served as precursors for \u03c0-extended arynes 8 upon treatment with butyllithium, while 6-fluoro[4]helicene (not shown) also served as an aryne precursor via dehydrofluorination upon treatment with Me2 (TMP)ZnLi (TMP, tetramethylpiperidino).9 The produced arynes were subjected to the Diels-Alder reaction with diarylated isobenzofurans,10 yielding cycloadducts (81-89% yields, not shown), which were easily transformed to half HBCs 9 by deoxygenative aromatization followed by aryl-aryl coupling in 78-96% yields (2 steps).\nScheme 2. Synthesis of half HBCs\n\nThird, benzene ring extension was accomplished through the attachment of a fluorobenzo moiety to existing fluoroarenes.7 Under microwave (MW) irradiation, commercially available 1-fluoronaphthalene was effectively cyanoethylated by aromatic nucleophilic substitution for fluorine (Figure 2). The half reduction of the nitrile gave aldehyde 10, whose difluorovinylidenation afforded the corresponding 1,1-difluoroallene 11. Next, 11 underwent Friedel-Crafts-type cyclization followed by dehydrofluorination to provide the benzene ring-extended fluorophenanthrene 12 in 94% yield (the first cycle). Application of second and third cycles similarly extended the \u03c0 system until it eventually afforded pinpoint-fluorinated [5]phenacene (picene) 13 (Scheme 3). In addition to phenacenes with zig-zag benzene rings, such as 13, triphenylene 14 with a trigonal structure was produced by applying the benzene ring extension cycle to internally fluorinated arenes (Scheme 4).\nFigure 2. Benzene ring extension cycle\n\nScheme 3. Synthesis of fluorinated phenacenes\n\nScheme 4. Synthesis of fluorinated triphenylenes\n\nApart from cyclizations, 1,1-difluoroallenes also undergo \u03b1-selective addition of oxygen nucleophiles, such as phenols, carboxylic acids, and sulfonic acids, in the presence of an Au(I) or an Au(III) catalyst (Scheme 5).11 Thus, using the aurated allylic CF2 cations, the hard O-nucleophiles were regioselectively introduced to 1,1-difluoroallenes, yielding 1,1-difluoroallylic ethers and esters 15 in 74%-92% yields. In contrast, soft sulfur and nitrogen nucleophiles underwent \u03b3-selective addition (vide infra: Scheme 9).\nScheme 5. Synthesis of 1,1-difluoroallylic ethers and esters\n\nBond Forming Reactions on the \u03b2-Carbon\n\nBond-forming reactions at the position \u03b2 to the fluorine substituents were facilitated by a palladium catalyst involving \u03c0-allylpalladium(II) formation.12 Difluoroallene 16 with a bromophenyl moiety was intramolecularly carbopalladated to form the \u03c0-allylpalladium(II) species with a six-membered ring structure, which in turn underwent \u03b2-hydrogen elimination, followed by isomerization to yield difluoromethylated naphthalene 17 in 60% yield (Scheme 6). The difluoromethyl group is a bioisostere of a hydroxy group and is attracting attention in the field of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals as a hydrogen donor for hydrogen bonding while simultaneously exhibiting hydrophobicity.\nScheme 6. Synthesis of difluoromethylated naphthalenes\n\nThe intramolecular \u03b2-selective carbometallation was followed by intermolecular fluorometallation (cat. Pd(0)/PhI/AgF, Scheme 7),13 where the generation of vinylsilver(I) was proposed to participate in Pd(0)-catalyzed coupling, leading to (trifluoromethyl)alkene 18 in 65% yield. A rhodium(I) catalyst bearing a nitrogen ligand facilitated C-S bond formation in a \u03b2-selective fashion (Scheme 8), while Rh(I) with a phosphine ligand promoted \u03b3-addition (vide infra: Scheme 10).14\nScheme 7. Synthesis of arylated (trifluoromethyl)alkenes\n\nScheme 8. Synthesis of sulfanylated (difluoromethyl)alkenes\n\nBond Forming Reactions on the \u03b3-Carbon\n\nOrganocopper(I) reagents promote \u03b3-selective bond-forming reactions in almost all cases.15 3-Monosubstituted 1,1-difluoroallene 19 reacted with ethylcopper(I) to afford the corresponding addition product, \u03b3-branched 1,1-difluoro-1-alkene 20 (E = H), in 95% yield via protonolysis of the 2,2-difluorovinylcopper(I) intermediate (Figure 3).16 When quenched by electrophiles, such as halogenating agents and halostannanes, \u03b2-functionalized 1,1-difluoro-1-alkenes 21 and 22, respectively (66%-84% yields). The 2,2-difluorovinylcopper(I) intermediates enabled Pd(0)-catalyzed coupling with iodobenzene, yielding a three-component coupling product 23 in 90% yield.\nFigure 3. Synthesis of \u03b3-branched 1,1-difluoro-1-alkenes\n\nB2pin2 and PhMe2SiBpin with a Cu(I)-catalyst promoted \u03b3-selective borylation and silylation of 1,1-difluoroallenes, which afforded 3,3-difluoroallylboronate 24 and silane 25 in 86% yields, respectively (Figure 4).17 The formed difluoroallylboronates reacted with aldehydes to provide 2,2-difluorohomoallylic alcohols (not shown).\nFigure 4. Synthesis of 3,3-difluoroallylic boronates and silanes\n\nAs well as undergoing alkylation, borylation, and silylation reactions, 1,1-difluoroallenes underwent the \u03b3-selective addition of benzamide and thiophenol in the presence of an Au(I) [or an Au(III)] catalyst through cationic intermediates (Scheme 9, see also: Scheme 5).11 3,3-Difluoroallylic amine 26 and thioether 27 were synthesized in 81% and 72% yields, respectively. The use of a Rh(I) catalyst with a chiral phosphine ligand aided in the synthesis of chiral 3,3-difluoroallylic thioether 28 via \u03b3-selective C-S bond formation (Scheme 10, see also: Scheme 8).14\nScheme 9. Synthesis of 3,3-difluoroallylic amines and thioethers\n\nScheme 10. Synthesis of chiral 3,3-difluoroallylic thioethers\n\nThe related monofluoroallenes underwent \u03b3-selective intramolecular C-O and C-N bond formations in the presence of an Ag(I) catalyst (Scheme 11). Ring-fluorinated heterocycles, dihydropyran 29, and tetrahydropyridine 30, were obtained in 54% and 52% yields, respectively.18\nScheme 11. Synthesis of heterocyclic fluoroalkenes\n\nIn summary, since our report on the synthesis of 1,1-difluoroallenes by carbonyl difluorovinylidenation, the reactions of 1,1-difluoroallenes have been steadily investigated and their unique reactivities have been revealed. Now, regioselective bond-forming reactions in 1,1-difluoroallenes can be successfully effected at each of the three, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-positions with the aid of metals, such as In(III), Au(I), Au(III), Pd(0), Cu(I), and Ag(I), which enables the synthesis of fluorinated and fluorine-free cyclic and acyclic molecules. As a result, 1,1-difluoroallenes are extremely adaptable synthetic building blocks. Despite these advances in ionic reactions, further research on their behavior under radical conditions and in electrocyclization processes is still required.19"

            "Ethoxypillar[6]arene. An oven-dried 2000 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead stirrer (IKA Rw 20 digital) and an argon inlet, the third neck is left unequipped. The vessel is flushed with argon for 10 min (Note 2). 1,4-Diethoxybenzene (40.00 g, 1.0 equiv, 0.24 mol) (Note 3) and paraformaldehyde (14.38 g, 2.0 equiv, 0.48 mol) (Note 4) are charged in the reaction vessel. The solids are agitated at 410 rpm for 5 min under a flow of argon (Figure 1A). Under argon flow, chlorocyclohexane (1.0 L) (Note 5) is added to the reaction vessel through the open inlet. The resulting white cloudy suspension is mixed for 10 min (Figure 1B). The flow of argon is reduced, and a rubber septum is placed on the open neck. While stirring, BF3\u2022Et2O (40 mL, 1.3 equiv, 0.32 mol) (Note 6) is added via syringe (6-inch, 18-gauge stainless steel needle, 50 mL disposal syringe) in a continuous stream (addition time less than 1 min). After approximately 1 min the white cloudy suspension changed to a green suspension with white precipitate (Figure 1C). After approximately 2 min, the suspension changed to a dark green-black suspension (Figure 1D). A small exotherm from 22 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C is observed. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool while stirring for 1.5 h.\nFigure 1.

A brown precipitate forms (Figure 1G) and the suspension is stirred for 5 min (Note 7). The precipitate (Figure 2A) is collected by vacuum filtration using a 20 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel, a 2 L filter flask, and Whatman 185 mm diameter filter paper (Notes 8 and 9), the precipitate is left to dry under suction for 30 min. The black filtrate (Figure 2B) is discarded and the B\u00fcchner funnel is re-equipped with the filter flask. The heterogenous precipitate (Figure 2A) is broken up (Note 10) while under suction. The solid is washed with anhydrous ethanol (300 mL). Once dry, the heterogenous solid is crushed again, breaking up larger pieces. This process is repeated with four more volumes of ethanol (4 x 300 mL) (Note 10). The B\u00fcchner flask is emptied before each wash, and each subsequent filtrate becomes clearer and more colorless (Figure 2C) with the solid eventually becoming a fine tan homogenous powder (Figure 2D). After the final wash with ethanol, the solid is left to dry under suction for 1 h.\nFigure 2. A) Heterogenous precipitate before ethanol washes, B) Filtrate before ethanol washes, C) Filtrate after fifth ethanol wash, D) homogenous precipitate after fifth ethanol wash (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe dry solid is added to dichloromethane (1000 mL) (Figure 3A), and the suspension stirred at room temperature (820 rpm) for 30 min. The filtrate is collected by suction filtration using a 20 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel, a 2 L filter flask, and Whatman 185 mm diameter filter paper (Note 11). The precipitate is washed with dichloromethane (3 x 200 mL) (Figure 3B). The organic filtrates are combined (Figure 3C) and concentrated to 400 mL (Note 12) by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C, 50-200 mmHg) (Figure 3D).\nFigure 3. A) Suspension in dichloromethane, B) precipitate from suspension, C) filtrate from suspension, D) filtrate after reducing on rotary evaporator (photos provide by submitters)\n\nThe solution is washed with saturated NaHCO3 (3 x 300 mL) (80 g in 1 L distilled H2O) followed by a brine wash. The brown solution (Figure 4A) turns yellow after the brine wash (Figure 4B) (Note 13). The combined aqueous layers are washed with dichloromethane (100 mL). The organic layers are combined (Figure 4C) and dried over MgSO4 (20 g). The drying agent is collected with suction filtration using an 8.5 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel, 1 L filter flask, and Whatman 70 mm diameter filter paper, and this solid is washed with dichloromethane (2 x 50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 \u00b0C and gradually increased to 80 \u00b0C, 50-200 mmHg). The solid is further dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) with heating (50 \u00b0C) using an oil bath for 48 h (Note 14). Ethoxypillar[6]arene (19.40 g) is obtained as a white-yellow powder (Figure 4D, 84% purity, 45% yield, 38% corrected for purity) (Note 15).\nFigure 4. A) Filtrate after one wash with brine, B) Filtrate after three brine washes, C) Combined organic layers, D) EtOP6 (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe crude ethoxypillar[6]arene is recrystallized (Note 16) by dissolving the crude material in chloroform (600 mL) in a 2 L round-bottomed flask, and acetone (600 mL) is then added to the solution (Figure 5A). The round-bottomed flask is then placed in a -20 \u00b0C freezer for 24 h. The precipitate (Figure 5B) is collected by suction filtration using a 20 cm diameter B\u00fcchner funnel, a 2 L filter flask, and Whatman 185 mm diameter filter paper. The solid is further dried under vacuum (55 \u00b0C, 0.3 mmHg) for 48 h (Note 17). Ethoxypillar[6]arene (13.32 g) is collected as a white crystalline solid (Figure 5C, 97% purity) (Note 19). The filtrate is placed in the -20 \u00b0C freezer for an additional 24 h, and an additional portion of ethoxypillar[6]arene (1.06 g) is obtained after drying in the same manner as above (Notes 18 and 19).\nFigure 5.

A 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4.0 cm magnetic stirrer bar and a 30 cm reflux condenser is charged 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran (100 mL, 0.772 mol, 1.00 equiv) (Note 2) and deionized H2O (200 mL, 11.1 mol, 14.4 equiv). The biphasic reaction mixture is then placed into a pre-heated IKA heating block at 90 \u00b0C and stirred at 500 rpm. The reaction mixture is stirred while heating for 2 h, producing a clear homogenous light-yellow solution (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Reaction set-up for step A after 2 h at 90 \u00b0C (photo provided by checkers)\n\nThe condenser is replaced by a distillation apparatus equipped with a thermometer port and a vacuum adaptor. A 250 mL round-bottomed flask is attached at the receiving end (Note 3) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Distillation set-up following insulation with aluminum foil and cotton wool using a water-jacketed distillation apparatus and 250 mL round-bottomed receiving flask (photo provided by checkers)\n\nThe reaction temperature is increased to 120 \u00b0C and the distillate is collected for 2.5 h at atmospheric pressure (Note 4). The remaining solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (Note 5) over 40-45 min at 75 mmHg with the water bath temperature set at 65 \u00b0C (Note 6). toluene (100 mL) is added to the yellow oil and the solvent removal process is continued (75 mmHg, 65 \u00b0C) to facilitate azeotropic removal of any residual water. This process is repeated twice more with toluene (2 x 100 mL) to leave behind crude succinaldehyde (ca. 60 g) as a yellow oil (Note 7). The crude product is then transferred to a 100 mL round-bottomed flask (Note 8) equipped with a 2.5 cm magnetic stirrer bar for purification by short-path single-bulb distillation. To this flask is attached a distillation apparatus equipped with a thermometer and vacuum adapter. A 100 mL round-bottomed receiving flask is attached at the end. The receiving flask is subsequently cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C (dry ice/acetone) (Note 9) and the system is placed under high-vacuum (0.08 mmHg) (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Short-path single-bulb high-vacuum distillation set-up following insulation with aluminum foil and cotton wool (photo provided by checkers)\n\nThe round-bottomed flask containing the crude product is subsequently heated to 80 \u00b0C (IKA heating block) and succinaldehyde (48.5 g, 73% yield) is obtained at 38-40 \u00b0C (vapor temperature) as a colorless oil (Notes 10, 11, 12, 13).",

To a 2 L round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4.0 cm magnetic stirrer bar is added freshly distilled succinaldehyde (25.0 g, 0.290 mol, 1.00 equiv) and EtOAc (390 mL, 0.75 m) (Note 14). The solution is briefly stirred (800 rpm, 30 sec) to ensure full dissolution of succinaldehyde and formation of a homogenous solution (Note 15). To the rapidly stirring solution is added 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (1.22 g, 7.25 mmol, 2.50 mol%) as an internal standard, followed by l-Proline (669 mg, 5.81 mmol, 2.00 mol%). The reaction mixture is stirred (800 rpm) at room temperature for 40 h (Figure 4) (Note 16).\nFigure 4. Visual appearance of the reaction following stirring at room temperature for 40 h (photo provided by checkers)\n\nThe reaction mixture is subsequently diluted to 0.35 m by the addition of EtOAc (440 mL) and an aliquot (0.1 mL) is taken to check for conversion of succinaldehyde (Note 17). Thiomorpholine trifluoroacetate (1.26 g, 5.81 mmol, 2.00 mol%) (Note 18) is then added before the reaction mixture is placed into a pre-heated IKA heating block (70 \u00b0C) and stirred for 2 h (Notes 19 and 20) (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. A) Reaction appearance after 5 min of heating, B) Reaction appearance after 2 h of heating (photos provided by checkers)\n\nFollowing this, an aliquot (0.1 mL) is taken to check for conversion of succinaldehyde and the NMR yield of bicyclic enal 2 (Note 21). Pre-treated wet silica gel (Note 22) is then added, and the reaction mixture is removed from the heating block and allowed to cool to room temperature (Note 16) while stirring vigorously for 30 min (Note 23). The crude reaction mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel into a 2 L filter flask equipped with a 4.0 cm oval magnetic stir bar. The reaction flask and filter cake are then washed thoroughly with EtOAc (2 \u00d7 250 mL) (Note 24). Aqueous Na2SO4 (500 mL, 12% w/w) (Note 25) is added to the mother liquor and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 10 min before transferring to a 2 L separating funnel and allowing the phases to separate (Note 26). The aqueous phase is separated, and the organic phase is collected. Extraction of the aqueous phase is repeated two more times with EtOAc (2 \u00d7 500 mL) and the organic phases are combined, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure (7.5 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) to afford a crude brown oil (Figure 6).\nFigure 6.

Crude bicyclic enal 2 is charged directly onto a column (5 \u00d7 45 cm) containing pre-treated wet silica gel (150 g) (Note 22) using dichloromethane (25 mL) to facilitate transfer. The desired product is eluted with 50% EtOAc in n-pentane (45 mL fractions) and obtained in fractions 30-72 (Note 28). The fractions containing product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure (7.5 mmHg, 25 \u00b0C) to afford bicyclic enal 2 (5.76 g, 26% yield, >99:1 e.r., 1.94:1 d.r.) as a light brown solid (Notes 29, 30, and 31) (Figure 7).\nFigure 7.

These fractions are pooled and concentrated under reduced pressure (30 \u00b0C bath, 75 mmHg) in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask to afford a yellow-orange solid (Figure 7).\nFigure 6 Column dry-loaded with product-adsorbed silica\n(photo provided by submitters)\nFigure 7.

The 500 mL round-bottom flask is then fitted with an air condenser open to air. The joint between the air condenser and the round-bottomed flask is fitted with a green 24/40 keck clamp. The apparatus is then placed in an oil bath preheated to 45 \u00b0C and stirred for 10 min (Figure 8).\nFigure 8 Product mixture after stirring in the oil bath for 10 min\n(photo provided by checkers)\nAfter the allotted time, pentane (60 mL) (Note 21) is poured slowly down the wall of the air condenser into the solution, over 5 min (Note 22).\nFigure 9. Precipitation of a white solid during recrystallization\n(photo provided by checkers)\nThe apparatus is then removed from the oil bath and placed in an ice bath for 30 min. A white solid precipitates out of the yellow-orange solution (Figure 9). The solution is then poured through a B\u00fcchner funnel fitted with a piece of Whatman 4 qualitative filter paper, and the white crystals are collected onto the filter paper. The crystals are washed with pentane (2 \u00d7 30 mL), collected into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask, and weighed (2.185 g). The filtrate is then concentrated under reduced pressure to afford an orange solid, which is recrystallized again (Note 23). The product collected during this second recrystallization is combined with the triphenylene crystals in the 100 mL round-bottomed flask and dried under vacuum (<1.0 mmHg) for 30 min (Note 24) to afford a white crystalline solid (2.61 g, 76%) (Figure 10) (Notes 25 and 26).\nFigure 10.

            "The synthesis of C-C bonds by cross-coupling of carbon nucleophiles with carbon electrophiles has revolutionized organic synthesis. While C(sp2)-C(sp2) bond formation has been well-developed, C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond formation has become increasingly important to drug discovery. While advancements have been made in carbon nucleophile synthesis, it remains the case that carbon electrophiles are more abundant than carbon nucleophiles. An increasingly useful solution is found in the cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) of C(sp2) and C(sp3) electrophiles, exemplified by Step B in our original Org. Synth. publication above. In these XEC reactions, cross-selectivity depends upon the relative ease of radical formation rather than electronic differences of the coupling partners, providing a complementary tool for expanding chemical space. This update provides an overview of the many advancements in the XEC of aryl (and vinyl) (pseudo)halides with alkyl halides (and other alkyl radical equivalents) with an emphasis on practical advancements. As this field is rapidly expanding, more comprehensive treatments of XEC reactions are available for further reading.2,3,4,5\nMechanism\nAt the time of our original report, the mechanism of XEC of aryl halides with alkyl halides was poorly understood. Studies by our group had shown that these reactions did not proceed via an organozinc intermediate,6,7 ruling out established Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling mechanisms. Informed by key prior electrochemical studies,8,9 further studies suggested a new type of mechanism (Figure 1).10,11 Subsequent studies2,12,13 have largely converged on three essential elements:\n1) The alkyl electrophile is converted into an alkyl radical intermediate, and the aryl or vinyl electrophile reacts with the Ni catalyst to form an (L)NiII(Ar)X intermediate by a non-radical mechanism.\n2) The alkyl radical reacts with the (L)NiII(Ar)X intermediate to form a putative (L)NiIII(Ar)(Alkyl)X intermediate that rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to form the C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond.\n3) The Ni catalyst is reduced to turn over the catalytic cycle.\nFigure 1. General proposed mechanism for C(sp2)-C(sp3) XEC\n\nWhile the exact details of this mechanism are still a source of active investigation and debate, its study has led to improved understanding of the mechanistic steps involved.3,11,13,14 This understanding has led to expansion of the substrate classes that participate in the transformation, enantioselective methods, an explosion of related variants such as metallaphotoredox and electrochemical approaches, and applications in total synthesis.\nNew Radical Precursors\nWhile alkyl halides are far more abundant than alkyl organometallic reagents, the largest commercially available pools of aliphatic electrophile diversity are alcohols, amines, and alkanoic acids. A major, recent advance has been the development of methods to cross-couple these substrate pools, sometimes with a simple in situ activation step (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Radical precursors used in XEC coupling reactions\n\nWhile conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides is often high yielding, in parallel synthesis applications the extra steps and purifications are limiting; on scale, the extra time and solvent is a large cost. Directly utilizing alcohols without stoichiometric activation has been limited to more activated substrates, such as allylic and benzylic alcohols. Ukaji reported the coupling of benzylic alcohols with aryl iodides enabled by a low-valent Ti Lewis acid.15 Both Shu and Wang reported a similar approach for the reaction between allylic alcohols and aryl halides, instead employing Zr and Mg Lewis acids, respectively.16,17 For reactions with unactivated alcohols, many groups have focused on the coupling of redox-active alcohol derivatives or in situ generation of alkyl halides.8,18,19 Martin reported the use of N-alkoxyphthalimides which, upon reduction, generate O-centered radicals that undergo \u03b2-scission to generate alkyl radicals that engage in XEC.20 Gong utilized dialkyl oxalates which can undergo Barton C-O scission to generate 3\u00b0 and stabilized alkyl radicals capable of engaging in XEC with aryl halides.21,22 Molander reported the Ni-catalyzed XEC of unactivated alkyl tosylates with aryl and heteroaryl bromides using KI as a mediator, generating the alkyl iodide in situ.23 We reported a protocol for the coupling of benzyl mesylates with halides using co-catalytic cobalt phthalocyanine (Co(Pc)).24 The use of tosylates has been used in several industrial applications since these original reports.25,26 The in situ conversion of alcohols to alkyl bromides has been reported using three different strategies: 1) the Li group used a paired electrolysis strategy to generate Ph3PBr2 in situ for concurrent bromination and XEC, avoiding the use of a metal terminal reductant,27 2) we used a phosphonium reagent and Bu4NBr for a rapid in situ pre-bromination step followed by XEC, which was amenable to high-throughput experimentation (HTE) in the solution phase,28 and 3) Gong and Ma utilized a oxazolium bromide for a fast pre-bromination step, which proved useful for the selective monofunctionalization of diols.29\nAlkyl amines have also proven to be a ready source of alkyl radicals through the reduction of the corresponding pyridinium salt. These salts, initially described by Katritzky,30 are readily prepared through condensation with commercially available pyrylium salts and have been shown to furnish alkyl radicals following single electron reduction.31,32 Watson and co-workers first described the use of these pyridinium salts in their Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling with aryl boronic acids, demonstrating radical formation with Ni in a redox-neutral coupling.33 Following this report, several groups concurrently reported Ni-catalyzed XEC methods of aryl iodides and bromides with alkyl pyridinium salts.32,34,35,36,37 Martin's work suggests that neither on-cycle Ni0 or NiII intermediates are capable of reducing pyridinium salts to form alkyl radicals. Rueping shows theoretical support for the proposed mechanism that these methods share, while the work by Han displays an expanded scope to include alkyl halides and alkynyl bromides as coupling partners. Molander utilized an organic photocatalyst and Et3N as the terminal reductant in combination with Ni to induce the reaction without a metal reductant. The use of alkyl pyridinium salts has also been extended to the coupling of acyl electrophiles to synthesize functionalized ketones.38,39\nBased upon seminal studies in photoredox catalysis by Okada and Overman,40,41 we reported the use of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters in XEC reactions with aryl iodides.42 These NHP esters can be readily prepared via condensation with N-hydroxyphthalimide. Following single electron reduction, these esters fragment to release CO2, phthalimide anion, and an alkyl radical. NHP esters react with Ni catalysts at rates similar to alkyl iodides, and we reported that reactivity can be modulated by introducing electronic-tuning groups on the phthalimide backbone and by adjusting the solvent polarity.43 These esters have been coupled to alkynyl bromides44 and acyl electrophiles, such as anhydrides and 2-pyridyl thioesters.45,46\nWe demonstrated that a 2\u00b0 alkyl radical, formed via epoxide opening using a titanocene co-catalyst, can be coupled with (L)NiII(Ar)Br species to form a new C-C bond.47 The opening of epoxides and aziridines can also be achieved through the use of an iodide co-catalyst, which provides an iodohydrin or \u03b2-iodoamine, respectively, that can participate in the XEC as previously described.47,48 Additionally, redox active sulfones have been shown to generate alkyl radicals following single electron reduction, which can then engage in XEC with aryl bromides.49\nNew Catalyst Systems and Conditions\nInitial studies on XEC established a set of conditions: amide solvents, bipyridine (bpy) and phenanthroline (phen) ligands, Zn or Mn reductant, and iodide salt additives. Several challenging substrate classes have driven the discovery of new catalysts and conditions that are broadly useful.\nFigure 3 contains ligands that have been reported for the coupling aryl halides with alkyl radical precursors. Pyridyl-2-carboxamidine (PyCam) and pyridyl-2,6-bis(carboxamidine) (PyBCam) ligands, found via a screen of Pfizer's compound collection for new nitrogen ligand motifs,50 are useful for aryl halides with coordinating groups in the 2-position and for a variety of heteroarenes.51 BpyCam (2,2'-bipyridine-6-carboxamidine) derivatives and N-cyano carboxamidine ligands have also shown promise in a growing collection of challenging reactions.52,28 Dual ligand strategies commonly include combinations of bidentate N-donor ligands with phosphines,6,53 terpyridines,54 and pyridines.23,55 For the cross-coupling of unstrained 3\u00b0 alkyl halides, substituted pyridines are among the best available ligands.55,56 Finally, Sevov reported on the use of a Ni \"overcharge protector\" complex, which prevents over-reduction of the Ni catalyst.57\nSeveral groups have reported on conditions where the alkyl radical is formed by a co-catalyst or stoichiometric additive, independent of the Ni catalyst. In several cases, pyridinium salts and NHP esters can be directly reduced by Mn or Zn to form alkyl radicals.32,58 We demonstrated that benzyl mesylates, which are unreactive with (bpy)Ni catalyst, could be activated by Co(Pc) co-catalysis to furnish diarylmethanes.24 Co(Pc) is capable of undergoing nucleophilic substitution with benzyl mesylates, after which homolysis of the Co-C bond furnishes the benzyl radical. This radical can then be captured by the (bpy)NiII(Ar)Br species and form product upon reductive elimination. Komeyama extended this work to unactivated alkyl tosylates by using the more nucleophilic vitamin B12.59 Hazari and Zultanski further demonstrated the utility of Co(Pc) in the organoreductant-promoted coupling of unactivated alkyl bromides with aryl bromides.60 The Molander group has shown NHP esters can form electron-donor-acceptor complexes with Hantzsch ester which, upon photoexcitation, can generate alkyl radicals that then interact with the Ni catalyst for productive cross-electrophile coupling.61 Our group and others have used Ni/Ti co-catalysis to generate alkyl radicals through the ring-opening of epoxides and demonstrating their coupling with aryl halides.62,63 Ni/photoredox co-catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to form C-C bonds centered around decoupling radical and polar elementary steps. Lei, Vanucci, and Molander have reported metallaphotoredox XEC reactions using aliphatic amines as the terminal reductant.37,64,65 MacMillan reported on a Ni/Ir catalyst system enabled by the use of silane reagents to facilitate alkyl radical formation from alkyl halides by halogen-atom transfer to a silicon-centered radical.66,67 By tuning the silane, this approach has been extended to other substrates.68,69\nFigure 3. Reported ligands for C(sp2)-C(sp3) XEC. Ligands that have been used with at least three different radical precursors are highlighted in purple\n\nNew Reductants\nThe most common electron sources used in XEC for catalyst turnover are metal reductants, typically Zn or Mn powder, which are inexpensive, easy to handle and store on the benchtop, possess good atom economy (27-33 g per mole of electrons), and the resulting metal salts are easily separated from products. However, in >100 g scale applications, these heterogenous reductants present mass-transfer limitations, sometimes resulting in irreproducible kinetics,70,71,72 and disposal of large amounts of metal salts can be complicated.73,74 In addition, accurately characterizing the activity of metal powders is difficult, leading to lot-to-lot variability.\nThe use of organic terminal reductants has been explored, resulting in several different systems reported recently, such as pure organic reductants, photoredox-assisted organic reductants, and electrochemically driven organic reductants (Figure 4). These alternative reduction systems often allow for non-amide solvents to be used, suggesting solvent limitations are tied to the reductant rather than the catalyst. We utilized tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) in mechanistic studies to support that an organozinc intermediate was not necessary for XEC.10 We also found that the use of TDAE as reductant in XEC allows for the use solvents such as acetonitrile and propylene carbonate.73 Reisman demonstrated that TDAE could drive XEC reactions between NHP esters and alkenyl bromides.75 Recent work by Hazari, Uehling, Zultanski and coworkers reported the synthesis and use of tuned homogeneous reductants based on the tetraaminoethylene scaffold seen in TDAE.60 These new reductants exhibit a range of reduction potentials as well as increased air-stability, allowing for use and storage on the benchtop. A variety of groups have reported on the use of sacrificial Zn, Fe, or steel anodes for XEC reactions.76 While this avoids issues with stirring metal powders, it still results in stoichiometric metal salt waste. Some recent reports have utilized an amine terminal reductant in a divided electrochemical cell.54,77 Several groups concurrently reported on the use of photoredox catalysis to allow the use of organic terminal reductants, such as silanes and 3\u00b0 amines.37,64,65,66\nFigure 4. Reductants used in XEC\n\nEnantioconvergent, Enantioselective, and Enantiospecific Reactions\nXEC reactions that allow setting a stereocenter have progressed rapidly alongside achiral work, often providing useful mechanistic insights as well as powerful new transformations. Although there exist parallels to enantioconvergent cross-coupling reactions with nucleophiles, realization of enantioconvergent XEC of racemic 2\u00b0 electrophiles proved to be complex. Initial studies by the Reisman group demonstrated the key concepts that set the stage for the present blossoming of the field. In particular, 2\u00b0 benzylic radical precursors have been the most reliable C(sp3) coupling partners for a variety of C(sp2) coupling partners.78,79,80,81,82 Coupling of aryl halides with \u03b1-halo nitriles,83 \u03b1-halo esters,84 and \u03b1-halo sulfones85 also appear quite general. In a twist on benzylic radical precursors, the stereoconvergent XEC of styrenyl aziridines with aryl iodides using a chiral BiOx ligand was also reported.48 Recent work has included biimidazoline as a competent chiral ligand for the XEC of aryl or alkenyl halides with alkyl chlorides or styrene oxides under metallaphotoredox conditions.86,87 Several chiral ligand classes have allowed for enantioconvergent reactions (Figure 5).88,89\nBeyond enantioconvergent XEC, there are a few reports of enantioselective XEC. We have reported the enantioselective XEC of meso-epoxides with aryl bromides via a chiral Ti co-catalyst.62 Based upon studies by Gansauer,90 we proposed that this co-catalyst engaged in the enantioselective opening of the meso-epoxide, forming a \u03b2-titanoxy carbon radical, followed by radical capture by the (L)NiII(Ar)Br complex and reductive elimination to generate the trans-\u03b2-arylcycloalkanol.\nFigure 5. Chiral ligands utilized in enantioconvergent XEC\n\nIn 2016, the Jarvo lab reported the first enantiospecific XEC reaction (the intramolecular coupling of benzylic esters with aryl bromides) which proceeds via inversion at the benzylic center.91 Despite many advancements in enantiospecific, intramolecular C(sp3)-C(sp3) coupling, enantiospecific XEC of aryl and alkyl halides remains limited thus far.5,92\nAdaptation to Small and Large Scale\nInterest in applications to medicinal and process chemistry has driven innovation in reaction solvent, reactor design, and reductant choice. The outcomes of these approaches have demonstrated areas for improvement.\nMedicinal chemistry routinely uses parallel, small scale (\u2264~10 \u00b5mol) reactions to rapidly explore chemical space and process chemistry often uses the same parallel systems to optimize a key step. Adapting XEC to HTE revealed difficulties in stirring heterogeneous reactions, dosing small amounts of metal powders, and identifying additional catalysts to cover larger areas of chemical space.93 A number of reports addressed these issues by slurrying the metal powder and dosing the slurry with a large-bore pipette, which is sufficient as long as excess reductant is employed, and others utilized stirring with tumble stirrers.93 Another solution is coating the reductant onto ChemBeads94 (small glass beads) and then dosing by weight or volume (with a scoop); these have the added advantage of allowing the use of a shaker instead of a tumble-stirrer (Figure 6).9395 This approach has proven to be general for several different XEC reactions and is relatively affordable to implement.28,43,96\nFigure 6. Strategies for small-scale XEC at \u00b5mol and nmol scale\n\nOn the very smallest of scales, DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) have rapidly become a key tool in medicinal chemistry, but present unique challenges for reaction development as they usually require aqueous conditions, high salt concentrations, and very low substrate (DNA) concentrations.97 This has been addressed by utilizing reversible adsorption to solid support (RASS) with a silane terminal reductant, allowing the use of amide solvents without water or photochemical activation (Figure 6).98 The other main approach has been the use of metallaphotoredox catalysis (vide supra).99,100 Overall, XEC reactions appear amenable to DELs and we expect to see additional reports in this area in the future.\nOn larger scales, researchers have explored both batch and flow processes. Flow chemistry has become a key tool in the pharmaceutical industry for scale up and XEC has been adapted in several different ways, dependent upon the reduction approach: a packed Zn column,101 a flow electrochemical cell77 or a flow photochemical cell.102,103,104 Thus far, these flow reactions have been largely proof of concept and not yet scaled further, suggesting a promising area for future development.\nFollowing our original report in Org. Synth., reports on batch scale up reactions have also appeared. Most have used metal reductants (Mn or Zn), but sacrificial anode electrochemical reactions have also been explored.25,76 With metal powders, specialized stirring equipment and metal powder activation have been important to success as the reactor size (and shape) changes.25,70 To date, the largest reported XEC reaction is a batch reaction to produce 5.7 kg of product (64% yield). The reaction used Mn powder as the reductant (activated with TES-Cl) in a 600 L reactor.70\nConclusions\nNickel-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling has seen significant growth in the past decade. Since the initial report, the substrate scope has expanded to include epoxides, aziridines, and derivatives of carboxylic acids and alkyl amines as alkyl radical sources for coupling. Various modes of activation have been developed, and a clearer mechanistic understanding is being used to drive these advancements. As we and others continue to examine and address the limitations of these methods, we anticipate that cross-electrophile coupling will continue to evolve and become a mainstay in organic synthesis.\nThat leaves an important question: whither, nucleophiles?"

            "\u03b1-Diazo ketones have numerous applications in organic synthesis, serving as key synthetic intermediates in a number of important processes such as cyclopropanation, the Wolff rearrangement, and various C-H and heteroatom-H insertion reactions.2\nThe most widely used methods for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo ketones3 employ the acylation of diazo alkanes and \"diazo group transfer\"4 involving the base-promoted reaction of sulfonyl azides with \u03b2-dicarbonyl and other active methylene compounds. Direct diazo transfer to ketone enolates usually is not feasible,5 but diazo transfer to simple ketones can be achieved in two steps by an indirect \"deformylative diazo transfer\" strategy pioneered by Regitz4 in which the ketone is first formylated and then treated with a sulfonyl azide reagent.\nUnfortunately, several important classes of \u03b1-diazo ketones cannot be prepared in good yield by these standard methods. \u03b1'-Diazo derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones generally cannot be prepared by deformylative diazo transfer in good yield, and acylation of diazomethane with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acid chlorides and anhydrides generally is not successful because of the facility of dipolar cycloaddition to conjugated double bonds which leads to the formation of mixtures of isomeric pyrazolines. Also problematic are diazo transfer reactions involving base-sensitive substrates such as certain \u03b1,\u03b2-enones and heteroaryl ketones. Finally, the relatively harsh conditions and lack of regioselectivity associated with the thermodynamically controlled Claisen formylation step in the \"deformylative\" diazo transfer procedure limit the utility of this method when applied to the synthesis of diazo derivatives of many enones and unsymmetrical saturated ketones.\nIn 1990 we described the utility of a detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer strategy involving the trifluoroacetylation of kinetically generated lithium ketone enolates.6 This procedure has been illustrated in two Organic Syntheses procedures from our lab7 (e.g., Scheme 1). In the general procedure, reaction of the ketone substrate with 1.1 equiv of lithium hexamethyldisilazide in THF produces the corresponding lithium enolate, which is acylated by exposure to 1.2 equiv of trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate (TFETFA) at -78 \u00b0C. The resulting \u03b1-trifluoroacetyl ketone is then treated at room temperature with a sulfonyl azide in acetonitrile containing 1.0 equiv of water and 1.5 equiv of triethylamine. Column chromatography on silica gel furnishes the desired \u03b1-diazo ketone in good to excellent yield.\nScheme 1. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer (Org. Synth. 2016 procedure)7b\n\nThe key feature of the new procedure is the activation of the ketone starting material as the corresponding \u03b1-trifluoroacetyl derivative. The use of TFETFA to activate ketones in this fashion had not previously been reported, although Doyle employed a similar strategy to achieve diazo transfer to a base sensitive N-acyloxazolidone derivative.8 We found TFETFA to be superior to other trifluoroacetylating agents [e.g., CF3CO2Et, (CF3CO)2O] and the reaction of ketone enolates with this ester takes place essentially instantaneously at -78 \u00b0C. By contrast, the formylation of ketone enolates with ethyl formate is usually carried out using sodium hydride or sodium ethoxide as base and generally requires 12 to 48 h at room temperature for complete reaction.\nOnly one equivalent of base is required for the trifluoroacetylation step; apparently the chelated tetrahedral intermediate is stable at -78 \u00b0C and the \u03b2-dicarbonyl product is not generated until workup. Interestingly, in some cases the choice of LiHMDS for the generation of the ketone enolate proved superior to the use of LDA; however, in other cases no significant difference in the yield of diazo ketone was observed.\nIn this Discussion Addendum we describe recent experimental developments and review selected examples of the application of the protocol in the synthesis of natural products and other compounds.\n\nExperimental Developments\n\nClose to 100 papers have appeared reporting on the application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reaction since our original communication (1990) and Organic Syntheses article (1996). For the most part, these applications have employed the standard procedure described in our original papers, but there have been some developments with regard to the experimental procedure and these are reviewed in this section.\n\nChoice of Trifluoroacetylating Agent\n\nAs mentioned above, a central feature of our method is the activation of the carbonyl compound substrate by acylation with trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate at low temperature. The advantage of this approach over the classic diazo transfer procedure has been confirmed in a number of subsequent reports. For example, Sampson found that attempted application of the classic Regitz deformylative diazo transfer procedure to lactone 3 led to oligomeric products and none of the desired \u03b1-diazo lactone.9 Presumably, opening of the lactone by ethoxide ion generated in the initial formylation initiates oligomerization under these Claisen condensation type conditions. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer, on the other hand, provided the desired \u03b1-diazo lactone in good yield since the less nucleophilic trifluoroethoxide ion is not reactive enough to attack the lactone under the conditions of the reaction (Scheme 2).\nScheme 2. Diazo transfer with lactone 3\n\n\nMethod of Enolate Generation\n\nSeveral amide bases have been employed for generation of the enolate in the initial trifluoroacetylation step. In our original study we found that LDA and LiHMDS gave similar results in the case of many ketones including acetophenone and acetylcyclohexene. NaHMDS and KHMDS also appear to function similarly to LiHMDS in these diazo transfer reactions. On the other hand, as we reported previously, we observed dramatic improvements in the yield of diazo transfer product when LiHMDS rather than LDA was used in the case of several aryl and heteroaryl ketones including 2-acetylfuran and 3-acetylthiophene.6\nSampson has reported that LDA is a superior base for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer in the case of esters and lactones.9 For example, less than 10% of 4 was obtained using LiHMDS, possibly due to slow or incomplete deprotonation of 3 with this base which is significantly weaker than LDA.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the application of LiTMP as base can prove advantageous in reactions involving unsymmetrical ketones. For example, as illustrated in Scheme 3, improvements in both yield and regioselectivity were observed using LiTMP in the case of methyl ketone 5.10\nScheme 3. Effect of base on diazo transfer with unsymmetrical ketone 5\n\nAs reported in our original study, TMS enol ethers can also be deployed as enolate precursors for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reactions. As shown in Scheme 4, Wild exploited this version of the diazo transfer strategy in his synthesis of the antimycotic natural product chlorotetaine.11 Silyl enol ether 8 was first generated by diastereoselective deprotonation of the corresponding ketone using the chiral base lithium (R,R)-bis(phenethyl)amide followed by silylation. Exposure of the silyl enol ether to CH3Li then liberated the lithium enolate which was subjected to trifluoroacetylation and diazo transfer with tosyl azide to furnish the desired diazo ketone 9.\nScheme 4. Detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer via a silyl enol ether\n\n\nChoice and Stoichiometry of Sulfonyl Azide Reagent\n\nAlthough tosyl azide has traditionally been the reagent of choice for effecting diazo transfer reactions, we found methanesulfonyl azide to be a more convenient and in some cases superior reagent. As pointed out by Taber,12 the use of this reagent has the advantage that excess mesyl azide as well as methanesulfonamide byproducts are easily separated from the desired diazo ketone product by extraction into dilute aqueous base during workup.\nUnfortunately, both tosyl and mesyl azide pose safety hazards that restrict their use in many laboratories and for industrial applications. The thermal stability and explosion hazard associated with various diazo transfer reagents have been evaluated and compared in an excellent recent study.13 In our published Organic Syntheses procedures7 we employed 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azide14 and 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide (\"p-ABSA\")15 as safer alternatives to mesyl azide. In our experience, all three sulfonyl azides are equally effective for detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer, as shown in Scheme 5 for the case of enone 10, the substrate in our original Organic Syntheses procedure.7a Although mesyl azide has advantages with respect to atom economy and facility of product separation, on the basis of safety considerations, we generally recommend the use of p-ABSA, especially for larger scale preparative work.\nScheme 5. Comparison of diazo transfer reagents\n\nIn 1990 Evans and coworkers investigated how the ratio of azide formation vs. diazo transfer is affected by the choice of sulfonyl azide reagent and enolate counterion and found that diazo transfer is favored by the use of p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide.17 Although we obtained \u03b1-diazoacetophenone in only 21% yield using this reagent,6 other groups have reported successful diazo transfer using o-18 and p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide19,20,21 as the sulfonyl azide reagent with our protocol. Nakada, for example, reported the preparation of diazo ketone 13 using this modification of our method in a key step in their total synthesis of the polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol nemorosone (Scheme 6).20c\nScheme 6. Application of p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide in the diazo transfer reaction\n\nFinally, Brown has reported on the use of a polymer-bound sulfonyl azide reagent in our procedure,21a and Kumar has described the application of an \"ionic liquid-supported\" sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer step.22\nWith regard to stoichiometry, our original protocol called for the use of 1.5 equiv of sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer step. Besides being wasteful, the use of excess reagent can lead to complications in the isolation and purification of the desired diazo transfer product. It is therefore noteworthy that several groups have reported successful diazo transfer employing our protocol but with only 1.0-1.1 equiv of reagent (Scheme 7).23,24\nScheme 7. Application of 1.0-1.1 equiv of sulfonyl azide reagent in the diazo transfer reaction\n\nIn the case of our Organic Syntheses substrate 1 (Scheme 1), we found that when only 1.0 rather than 1.5 equiv of p-ABSA is used (under otherwise identical conditions) the desired product is obtained in ca. 10% lower yield and is difficult to separate from the ketone starting material.\nIt must be noted that while the great majority of laboratories have employed 1.0 to 1.5 equiv of sulfonyl azide for the diazo transfer, in some cases the use of a large excess of reagent (3 to 6 equiv) has been reported. We can imagine that the use of a large excess of reagent may be advisable in the case of diazo transfer reactions carried out in the late stages of a total synthesis where the reaction is performed on a relatively small scale and the yield of product is of paramount importance.\nIn summary, in our experience the optimal amount of sulfonyl azide must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For some applications 1.0 to 1.1 equiv of reagent can be used, while for valuable substrates we recommend using 1.5 equiv of the sulfonyl azide to maximize yield and to facilitate the separation of product from any possible unreacted starting carbonyl substrate.\n\nChoice of Solvent, Base, and Inclusion of Water in the Diazo Transfer Step\n\nThe use of 1.0 equiv of water in the diazo transfer step does not appear to be essential since a number of reports describe the use anhydrous acetonitrile in reactions producing the desired diazo carbonyl compound in good yield (e.g., see Schemes 2, 7 (14 to 15), and 825). Unfortunately, none of these reports provide a comparison of the results of the reaction with and without the presence of water. We have found in the case of several aryl and heteroaryl ketones that the yield of diazo ketone generally differs by no more than 10% when the reaction is carried out under anhydrous conditions rather than in the presence of water. We conclude that the addition of water may not always be necessary and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nScheme 8. Diazo transfer under anhydrous conditions\n\nThe great majority of researchers have followed our original protocol and used triethylamine as the base in the diazo transfer step. Taber, however, obtained better results by using DBU in place of Et3N in a diazo transfer reaction involving an ester and using p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl azide as the sulfonyl azide reagent (Scheme 9).19\nScheme 9. Diazo transfer with DBU as base\n\n\nOther Experimental Aspects\n\nAnother variation on our original protocol involves \"telescoping\" the two steps of the original procedure and carrying out the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer as a one-pot operation. In this case, the intermediate trifluoroacetyl derivative is not isolated and the reaction mixture from the trifluoroacetylation step is treated directly with base and the sulfonyl azide reagent (e.g., Scheme 6). We have found that this \"one pot\" procedure frequently gives comparable results to reactions carried out with isolation of the intermediate \u03b2-dicarbonyl compound.\n\nScope and Applications of the Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer\n\nThe application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer method to several important classes of compounds is highlighted in this section.\nDiazo Transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-Enones\nAs noted earlier, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds generally do not undergo diazo transfer in good yield under the conditions of the classical deformylative diazo transfer procedure. Our need for an efficient method for accessing \u03b1'-diazo derivatives of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones motivated the development of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer procedure and its application to \u03b1,\u03b2-enones was highlighted in our original report (e.g., Scheme 10).6\nScheme 10. Diazo transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones\n\nDetrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer has proven to be a general and efficient method for synthesizing a variety of \u03b1'-diazo-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones beginning with both methyl and cyclic unsaturated ketones. In particular, we have employed this chemistry extensively for the preparation of precursors to (trialkylsilyl)vinylketenes (e.g., Scheme 11).26 Along with the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of diethyl 3-diazo-2-oxopropylphosponate pioneered by Burtoloso,27 this constitutes the most useful method for the synthesis of this valuable class of synthetic building blocks.\nScheme 11. Diazo transfer with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones\n\nDiazo Transfer with Carboxylic Acid Derivatives\nIn 2000 we reported the extension of detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer to the preparation of \u03b1'-diazo derivatives of thiol esters and an example was subsequently published as an Organic Syntheses procedure (Scheme 12).28 As illustrated earlier, the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer method has also proven to be applicable to a wide range of lactones (e.g., Scheme 2)9 and carboxylic esters (e.g., Scheme 9).19,29\nScheme 12. Diazo transfer for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo thiol esters\n\nDiazo Transfer with Miscellaneous Substrates\nSince our original publication detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer has been applied for the synthesis of \u03b1-diazo derivatives of phosphonate and sulfonate esters.\nAs shown in Scheme 13, Brisbois applied the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol to dimethyl methylphosphonate and obtained the Seyferth-Gilbert reagent (\"DAMP\") in 50% yield.30\nScheme 13. Synthesis of DAMP via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer\n\nIn 2005, Ye and Zhou reported the synthesis of a series of \u03b1-diazo sulfonate esters as cyclopropanating agents using the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol (Scheme 14).31\nScheme 14. Synthesis of \u03b1-diazo sulfonate esters via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer\n\nExamples of Inefficient Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer\nAlthough the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer procedure has proven to have broad scope, several cases of unsuccessful reactions have been reported (Scheme 15). Attempts by Porter and coworkers to prepare diazo ketone 36 were not successful due to a failure to obtain the intermediate trifluoroacetyl ketone in good yield.32 Trauner recently reported that diazo ketone 37 could only be obtained in low yield under the conditions of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer protocol.33\nScheme 15. Diazo ketones not available via detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer in good yield\n\nApplications of Detrifluoroacetylative Diazo Transfer in Natural Product Synthesis\nWe close with several examples of the application of the detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer reaction in the synthesis of key intermediates for the synthesis of natural products, illustrating the application of the method in the context of highly functionalized substrates.\nAs shown in Scheme 16, Abad and coworkers were able to achieve diazo transfer to the sterically congested diketone 38 as a key step in their total synthesis of antiquorin and several other atisane diterpenes.34\nScheme 16. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of diterpenes\n\nAcetylation of the hydroxy group in 40 followed by detrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer on the resultant ester provided 41 in excellent yield; this diazo ester served as an intermediate in the synthesis of (+)-19-dehydoxyl arisandilactone A (Scheme 17).35\nScheme 17. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of nortriterpenoids\n\nDetrifluoroacetylative diazo transfer of the diene dione 42 served as a key step in the total synthesis of the sesquiterpene periconianone A by Reddy and coworkers (Scheme 18).36\nScheme 18. Diazo transfer in the synthesis of periconianone A"

Water (50 g) and benzylamine (12.9 mL, 13.2 g, 0.123 mol, 0.9 equiv) are added (Note 3 and Note 4). The reactor jacket is cooled by a recirculating chiller to 0-10 \u00b0C (Figure 1) and then 18% sulfuric acid (43.2 mL, 0.089 mol, 0.65 equiv made from 98% sulfuric acid) is added over 1 h while maintaining the reaction mixture at 4-8 \u00b0C (Note 5). The reaction flask is protected from light with aluminum foil as a general precaution. Glutaraldehyde (50%) (2) (25.8 mL, 0.137 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6) is added followed by acetone dicarboxylic acid (1, 20 g, 0.137 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Notes 7 and 8) while maintaining the reaction mixture at <5 \u00b0C to give a light-yellow solution. At this time 9% sodium acetate (47.8 mL, 0.055 mol, 0.4 equiv) solution is added over 1.5 h (Figure 2) (Note 9). The reaction mixture is aged at 5 \u00b0C for 20 h and then at 25 \u00b0C for 20 h. Slow gas evolution (CO2) is observed during the reaction (Note 10). A sample analyzed by HPLC indicates complete consumption of acetone dicarboxylic acid and less than 10:90 ratio of benzylamine to product (Note 11). Additional 18% sulfuric acid (approximately 10 mL) is added at 20-30 oC to adjust the solution's pH to 2. The solution is transferred to a 0.5 L separation funnel and extracted with MTBE (3 x 80 mL). The organic layers are discarded. The aqueous layer (Figure 3) is charged into a 2 L round-bottomed flask and mixed with heptane (500 mL). Silica gel (20 g) (Note 12) is added to the aqueous layer followed by aqueous 20% Na2CO3 (80 mL) to adjust the pH to 8 (Figure 4) (Note 13). The batch is filtered, and the filter cake washed with heptane (320 mL) (Note 14). The layers of the combined filtrate are separated (Figure 5), and the organic layer is dried with Na2SO4 (100 g) (Note 15). After removal of the drying agent by filtration, the solution is concentrated using a rotovap in a 1 L round-bottomed flask (bath temperature: 40 \u00b0C, vacuum: 75 mmHg). The residue is diluted with methanol (100 mL) and concentrated by rotary evaporation again. The residue is diluted with methanol to give a solution of 3 (93.8 g of solution) which contains 17.9 g (57%) of compound 3, as determined by quantitative 1H NMR assay. The purity of compound 3 is determined by HPLC and qNMR analysis (Notes 11 and 16). The crude product solution is used in the next step directly.\nFigure 1.

The one remaining neck is fitted loosely with a septum and is opened for addition of reagents (Figure 6) (Note 17). A solution of 3 (20.0 g in 190 g methanol, 0.087 mol, 1.0 equiv) is added and the reaction mixture is cooled to 0-10 \u00b0C using an ice bath. Sodium borohydride (6.6 g, 0.174 mol, 2.0 equiv) is charged in portions over 0.5 h while maintaining the batch temperature at 0-5 \u00b0C (Note 18). The batch is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 0.5 h until HPLC analysis indicates completion of reaction (Note 19). The batch is then cooled to 5 \u00b0C and quenched by slow addition of 10% hydrochloric acid (40 mL) to adjust the batch pH to 5-6. The flask is fitted with a distillation head assembly and is heated under vacuum to concentrate the solution (Figure 7) (bath temperature: 35 \u00b0C, vacuum: 75 mmHg) to about 50 mL, at which point the solution is cooled to 5 \u00b0C and mixed with MTBE (160 mL) (Note 21). At this time 20% NaOH solution (25 mL) is added at 5 \u00b0C to adjust the pH to 11-12 (Note 22). The two layers are separated, and the aqueous layer extracted with MTBE (160 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with 4% aqueous NaHCO3 solution (80 mL) and concentrated under reduced pressure (bath temperature: 35 \u00b0C, pressure: 75 mmHg) to remove all solvents (Note 23). Crude compound 4 is obtained in 19.2 g as a light-yellow solid (Figure 8) (95.5% by HPLC analysis, 93.0% by quantitative 1H NMR assay) containing 17.9 g product (89% yield), which is used directly in the next step (Note 24).\nFigure 6.

The solution is poured into a 500 mL addition funnel and added dropwise into a solution of NaOH (500 mL of 20% NaOH) over 1.5 hours while maintaining the quench batch temperature at or below 30 \u00b0C using an ice bath (Note 28). The pH of the resulting solution is observed to be 8-9. The solution is then extracted in a 2 L separatory funnel with ethyl acetate (3 x 400 mL), and the combined organic layers are washed with water (120 mL). The organic layer is concentrated in vacuo (bath temperature: 40\u00b0C, pressure: 40 mmHg) to remove all solvents to give 17.1 g of an oily residue (Figure 10), which contained 14.3 g (17.1 g x 83.5 wt%) 5 by quantitative 1H NMR analysis and 97% by HPLC analysis (Note 11) in 93% yield (Note 29).\nFigure 9.

(Caution: See Note 32). The reactor is then purged with nitrogen and pressurized with hydrogen at 50 psi and stirred (300 rpm) at 50 \u00b0C for 48 h (Figure 11) until the reaction is judged to be complete by GC (Note 33). The catalyst is filtered off through Solka Floc (Note 34), and the cake washed with isopropyl alcohol (100 mL). (Caution: fire hazard! See Note 32) The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature: 30 \u00b0C, pressure: 50 mmHg) to remove most of the solvents to give an oil residue which contained 11.6 g (29.1 g x 39.9 wt%) of product 6 as determined by quantitative 1H NMR analysis (89.6% yield) (Note 35).\nFigure 11.

The one remaining neck is left open for addition of reagents (Note 24). The solution of compound 6 (29.1 g x 39.9 wt% = 11.6 g, 92.6 mmol) in isopropyl alcohol, H2O (100 mL) and 3.05 g (9.26 mmol, 0.1 equiv) of Na2WO4\u20222H2O (Note 36) are added. The batch is cooled to 0-10 \u00b0C, and a pre-cooled aqueous solution (0-10 \u00b0C) of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP, 29.6 g, 342 mmol, 3.4 equiv) (Notes 37 and 38) (93 mL) is added dropwise over 70 min through a peristaltic pump (Figure 12). A sample is taken after another 0.5 h, and GC analysis indicates about 97% conversion (Note 39). The batch is transferred to a separation funnel and extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) (3 x 110 mL). A sample is taken from the combined organic layer and HPLC analysis indicates residual urea is 0.15 wt% (Note 40). The combined organic layers are concentrated using a rotary evaporator until most solvents are removed and the residue weighs about 24 g. The residue is dissolved in DCM (200 mL), and extracted with water (2 x 100 mL). The residual urea in the organic layer is below 0.05%, as determined by HPLC (Note 40). The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (60 mL). The residual urea in this organic layer is below 0.05% as determined by HPLC (Note 40). The combined organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure (bath temperature: 30\u00b0C, pressure: 75 mmHg) to ca. 110 mL. The solution is then further azeotropically distilled at constant volume with n-heptane (220 mL) under reduced pressure (jacket temperature: 30 \u00b0C, batch temperature: 14 \u00b0C, vacuum: 75 mmHg) to a final volume of 110 mL. The batch is cooled to between -10 \u00b0C and -5 \u00b0C, and a red solid forms during cooling (Figure 13). The slurry is stirred at this temperature for 18 h. The mixture is filtered, and the cake dried under vacuum (vacuum: 40 mmhg) below 30 \u00b0C for 2 h (Note 41). ABNO is obtained as a red solid (8.79 g, 68%) (Note 42) (Figure 14) in 99% purity as determined by GC analysis (Note 43).\nFigure 12.

            "N-Boc-N-Hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehyde 3 is a configurationally stable \u03b1-amino aldehyde,2 which was successfully converted to trans-oxazolidine methyl ester 4, a chiral synthon for \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids.3 The N-hydroxymethyl group on 3 shifts the equilibration to the five-membered cyclic hemiacetal 2, which ensures the high stability of the corresponding \u03b1-amino aldehyde and enables an intramolecular conjugate addition for highly diastereoselective introduction of an \u03b1-hydroxyl group. As a result, trans-oxazolidine methyl ester 4 was obtained from 2 as a chiral synthon for syn-\u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids.8,9 Even Garner's aldehyde,10 one of the most cited stable \u03b1-amino aldehydes, not only suffers from 3~5% racemization during the preparation and storage,3 Other \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids, \u03b2-deoxy-\u03b2,\u03b3-diamino acid, and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acid have been synthesized from N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes.2,4,5,6 In addition, phenylsulfonylnitromethane (5) has been used for a two-way homologation of aliphatic aldehydes, which was applied to synthesize precursors for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.7\nConfigurationally Stable \u03b1-Amino Aldehyde\nThe preparation of configurationally stable \u03b1-amino aldehyde for the applications as chiral synthons or auxiliaries has been an important topic in asymmetric synthesis because of the rather acidic \u03b1-proton adjacent to the carbonyl group.8,9 Even Garner's aldehyde,10 one of the most cited stable \u03b1-amino aldehydes, not only suffers from 3~5% racemization during the preparation and storage,8 but it is also only applicable to certain \u03b1-amino acids containing a hydroxyl group such as serine.\nWe have proposed N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 7 as a suitable candidate for the configurationally stable \u03b1-amino aldehyde and undertaken investigations to demonstrate their diverse applications (Scheme 1). Various N-protected amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine, valine, serine, leucine and isoleucine) were successfully converted to the corresponding N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 7, whose N-protecting group could be varied with a Boc, Cbz, or Ts group. As expected, N-protected N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 7 showed remarkable configurational stability due to the shift of equilibrium to the five-membered cyclic hemiacetal 6 (Scheme 1a).2,11 For example, phenylalaninal 2 showed 1~1.5% racemization during the preparation, and no racemization during the storage at room temperature for a month. N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl serinal (7, R1 = CH2OSiR3), an alternative for Garner's aldehyde, also showed less than 1% racemization during the preparation, and no racemization during storage at room temperature for 15 days. In addition, the aldehydes successfully reacted with various nucleophiles via the aldol reaction,11,12 the nitroaldol reaction,3,7 and the Wittig reaction.4,5,6,13,14,15,16\n\u03b3-Amino-\u03b2-hydroxy Acids from N-Hydroxymethyl \u03b1-Amino Aldehydes\nOne of the most useful applications of N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 7 was the stereoselective synthesis of a series of \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids 10 (Scheme 1a). The intramolecular conjugate addition of the N-hydroxymethyl group, which was introduced to enhance the stability of \u03b1-amino aldehyde, onto \u03b3-amino-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters 8 provided trans-oxazolidines 9 with high diastereoselectivity, presumably through a favored H-eclipsed conformation due to the allylic strain (Scheme 1b).\nScheme 1. Intramolecular conjugate addition with N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes\n\nThis synthetic strategy was first applied to the synthesis of (-)-statine, a key component of a natural antibiotic (Scheme 2a).4 The intramolecular conjugate addition onto (E)-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated methyl ester 12, prepared from N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl-L-leucinal via a Wittig reaction with methyl(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate, afforded trans-oxazolidine 13 (up to trans:cis = 10:1). The change in R1 group in Scheme 1 from a bulky isobutyl group (R1=-CH2CH(CH3)2, Scheme 2a) to a smaller group (R1=CH2OTBS, Scheme 2b) resulted in a decreased diastereoselectivity of trans-oxazolidine (trans:cis = 5:1).5 However, the reaction onto (Z)-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated methyl ester 1517 afforded much higher diastereoselectivity of trans-oxazolidine 16 (trans:cis > 20:1), which was converted to a glutamate receptor modulator threo-\u03b2-hydroxyglutamic acid (Scheme 2b).5\nScheme 2. Synthesis of \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids\n\nOther internal nucleophiles such as an N-aminomethyl group or N-hydroperoxymethyl group could be introduced by simple modification of the N-hydroxymethyl group in \u03b3-amino-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester (Scheme 3).6,14,15,16 The intramolecular conjugate addition with the N-aminomethyl group enabled the diastereoselective synthesis of a 3-aminodeoxystatine derivative 20. The intramolecular nucleophilic epoxidation of \u03b3-amino-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester 22 afforded anti-epoxide 23 with more than 20:1 diastereoselectivity, which was converted to trans-oxazolidinone 24, a precursor for a glutamate receptor modulator 3,4-dihydroxyglutamic acid, via 5-exo cyclization with the N-Boc group.15,18 Interestingly, a complementary anti-isomer of \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acid could be obtained by the modification of synthetic procedures. The regioselective reduction by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of anti-epoxide 27 gave anti-\u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acid (Scheme 3c),16 whereas the intramolecular conjugate addition of the N-hyroxymethyl group onto \u03b3-amino-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters gave syn-\u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acid (Scheme 2).\nScheme 3. Modification of N-hydroxymethyl for \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acid analogs\n\n\u03b2-Amino-\u03b1-hydroxy Acids from N-Hydroxymethyl \u03b1-Amino Aldehydes\nNext, the synthesis of one-carbon lower homologs of \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids, \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids, from N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 29 was explored (Scheme 4a).3 While \u03b3-amino-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters were used as a Michael acceptor for the synthesis of \u03b3-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids, nitroolefin derivatives such as 34 prepared with activated nitromethanes (i.e., PhSO2CH2NO2 (5)) was chosen as a one-carbon lower Michael acceptor for the synthesis of \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids because N-Boc-trans-oxazolidine methyl esters 31 could be conveniently obtained by sequential nitroaldol, dehydration, and stereoselective intramolecular conjugate addition reactions under mild basic conditions (29\u219233\u219234\u219230 in Scheme 4b), followed by one-pot ozonolysis. These sequential one-pot reactions could afford chiral synthons trans-oxazolidne methyl esters 31 in 65~79% yields with more than 20:1 diastereoselectivity from the corresponding N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes 29, which were readily prepared from \u03b1-amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine, leucine, valine, alanine and serine).\nScheme 4. Synthesis of \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids\n\nN-Boc-trans-Oxazolidine methyl esters 35, a properly protected form of \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acids, were useful synthons to synthesize derivatives of \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy acid. Basic hydrolysis of 35 followed by the peptide coupling with L-Leu-OMe or L-Val-OMe produced anti-leukemia dipeptide bestatin and its analogs without additional amino- or hydroxy-protecting steps (Scheme 5a).3,19 Furthermore, trans-oxazolidine methyl ester 37 derived from D-serine was efficiently converted to L-threo-hydroxyaspartic acid and L-threo-hydroxyasparagine after an oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group from deprotection of 37 to the carboxylic acid group of 38 (Scheme 5b).20 In addition, the orthogonal protecting groups on chiral intermediate 38 made the chemoselective peptide bond formation possible either at the \u03b1-amino group (38\u219239\u219240), \u03b2-hydroxyl group (38\u219239\u219241), \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (38\u219242), or \u03b2-carboxylic acid group (Scheme 5c).20 Therefore, trans-oxazolidine dicarboxylate 38 would be useful for the synthesis of bioactive peptides containing an L-threo-\u03b2-hydroxy aspartate moiety, such as WAP-8294A2, ramoplanin, dolastatins, kahalalide F and neurotoxin antillatoxin.\nScheme 5. Application of trans-oxazolidine methyl esters\n\nPhSO2CH2NO2 (5) for One-carbon Homologation\nBased on the reaction results between N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehyde 2 and phenylsulfonylnitromethane (PhSO2CH2NO2 (5)) as a one-carbon carboxylate synthon, we investigated a new one-carbon homologation of aliphatic aldehydes using PhSO2CH2NO2 (5). Unlike its reaction with N-Boc-N-hydroxymethyl \u03b1-amino aldehyde 2,3,19 the reaction of 5 with aliphatic aldehydes was not successful under similar basic conditions. After enormous attempts, aliphatic aldehydes were successfully converted to \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 46 under proline-catalyzed conditions (Scheme 6a).7 The nitroaldol reactions of 5 with aliphatic aldehydes followed by a dehydration reaction of the nitroaldol intermediate initially yielded \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 45, which was isomerized to favored \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 4621 in the absence of an internal nucleophile. The reaction time was dramatically shortened to 4 h under ultrasound irradiation conditions from 2~3 days with stirring at room temperature.\nScheme 6. Applications of PhSO2CH2NO2 (5) for one-carbon homologation\n\nThe preference of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 46 over \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 45 enabled a novel approach toward a two-way homologation of aliphatic aldehydes from the same intermediate \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone. First, carbonyl compounds (47) with one fewer carbon in the chain were obtained by the ozonolysis of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 46. Four different one-carbon lower carbonyl homologs, dimethyl acetal, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or primary alcohol, were obtained by quenching ozonides with trimethyl orthoformate and dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen peroxide, or sodium borohydride, respectively. Next, one-carbon higher carbonyl homologs 49 were obtained by the chemoselective double bond reduction of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 46 followed by the oxidation of phenylsulfonylnitromethyl group to the carbonyl group. The selective reduction was smoothly conducted probably by a conjugate addition of sodium cyanoborohydride onto \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 45, which was generated after in-situ isomerization of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-nitrosulfone 46 in DMF at 90 \u00b0C (46\u219245\u219248 in Scheme 6a). The divergent homologation developed was further applied for the synthesis of the two precursors for biologically active histone deacetylase inhibitors from the common C6-amino acid 50, a C5-amino acid derivative 52 and a C7-amino acid derivative 53 (Scheme 6b)."

Following this time, the flask is immersed in a 0 \u00b0C ice-water bath for 10 min before the reaction mixture is quenched by careful dropwise addition of 1M aqueous HCl (60 mL) over 10 min (Note 15). The reaction mixture is diluted with additional dichloromethane (50 mL) and transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is removed, and the remaining aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 60 mL each time). The organic fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (3 g) (Note 16), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 150 mmHg) to yield a dark brown oil (Figure 3B). This brown oil is mixed with silica gel (22 g) (Note 17) and dichloromethane (15 mL), and the mixture is evaporated to dryness. This dried silica is added to the top of a chromatography column (60 cm (length) x 4 cm (width) column containing an additional 90 g of silica gel (silica height 20 cm), and the product purified by column chromatography (Note 18) using hexanes and ethyl acetate (Note 19) as the eluents to yield 5 as a light brown oil (3.24 g, 11.4 mmol, 38%) (Figure 3C) (Notes 20, 21, and 22).\nFigure 3.

A flame-dried 250 mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2 cm x 0.6 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and charged with (E)-hex-3-en-1-yl (4-methoxyphenyl)sulfamate (5) (2.85 g, 10 mmol, 1 equiv), Pd2dba3 (1.37 g, 1.5 mmol, 0.15 equiv) (Note 23) and Cu(OAc)2 (1.82 g, 10 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 24), followed by acetonitrile (200 mL for a final concentration of 0.05 M) (Note 25). The round-bottomed flask is sealed with a rubber septum, which is then equipped with an exhaust bubbler via an 18 gauge needle (Figure 4A). A balloon is inflated with O2 and affixed with a disposable needle (Note 26). The reaction mixture is stirred (600 rpm), and the needle is lowered into the reaction solution and O2 is bubbled for 10 min. Following this time, the balloon is raised such that the needle is slightly above the reaction solution and the 18 gauge needle connected to the exhaust bubbler is removed from the rubber septum. The reaction vessel is then submerged in an oil bath preheated to 55 \u00b0C and kept at this temperature for 17 h (Figure 4B). Following this time, the reaction flask is lifted from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature over a period of 20 min. The reaction mixture is vacuum-filtered through a 2 cm pad of silica gel (Note 17) prepared on a medium-porosity sintered glass funnel (Note 27) to remove residual Pd and Cu salts (Figures 4C and 4D). The filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate (100 mL) (Note 19). After concentrating this solution under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 90 mmHg), the resulting brown oil (Figure 4b) is purified by column chromatography on silica (Notes 17 and 28) to yield ((E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-1,2,3-oxathiazinane 2,2-dioxide (6) as a light yellow solid (2.34 g, 8.3 mmol, 83%) (Figures 5A and 5B) (Notes 29, 30, and 31) as 6:1 mixture of trans/cis isomers.\nFigure 4.

            "A. N-Methyl-N-phenyl benzamide (3). A single-necked (24/40 joint) 500 mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3 cm, oval-shaped). The flask is dried in an oven (105 \u00b0C) for 16 h. The flask is brought out of the oven, sealed immediately with a rubber septum, and allowed to cool to room temperature (23 \u00b0C) in a desiccator (Note 2). The flask is purged with argon by connecting to an argon manifold using a needle (18G), and via another needle (18G) to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler. The atmosphere is maintained under a slight positive pressure of argon for the duration of the reaction (Note 3). The flask is then charged with triethylamine (6.5 mL, 47 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 4) using a plastic syringe fitted with a 21G needle, N-methylaniline (2) (4.2 g, 4.2 mL, 39 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Note 5) via a plastic syringe fitted with a 21G needle in one portion, and dichloromethane (72 mL, 0.50 M) (Note 6) via a glass syringe fitted with an 18G needle. The reaction flask is then placed in an ice bath maintained at 0 \u00b0C, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 10 min (250 rpm). Benzoyl chloride (1) (5.1 g, 36.33 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 7) is then added dropwise via a plastic syringe fitted with a 21G needle over 15 min. After 10 min of stirring (250 rpm), the reaction flask is removed from the ice bath, allowed to warm to 23 \u00b0C, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 16 h (250 rpm).\nFigure 1. Step A reaction setup A) Before the addition of benzoyl chloride, B) 0 min after addition of benzoyl chloride, C) 16 h after addition of benzoyl chloride (photo provided by submitters)\n\nAfter stirring for 16 h (250 rpm) at 23 \u00b0C (Note 8), the reaction mixture is diluted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and 1.0 M HCl (100 mL) (Note 9). The resulting mixture is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel (24/40 joint) and the layers are separated. The organic layer is washed with a saturated aqueous NaCl solution (2 x 100 mL), dried over Na2SO4 (81 g) (Note 10), and filtered through a fritted B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 11) into a 1 L round-bottomed collection flask (24/40 joint). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to produce 11.2 g of the crude product as an oil (Note 12). Silica gel (14.3 g) is added to the crude oil, followed by the addition of dichloromethane (30 mL). The resulting suspension is concentrated under reduced pressure (Note 13) then placed under high vacuum at 23 \u00b0C for 1 h prior to column chromatography. The mixture is then purified via flash column chromatography using hexanes: ethyl acetate as the eluent (Note 14). The eluate containing the product (Note 15) is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (Note 16). The product is then stored at -20 \u00b0C for 14 h, leading to crystallization of the product. The resulting solid is crushed using a spatula and placed under high vacuum for 2 h at 15-min intervals (Note 17) to afford N-methyl-N-phenyl benzamide (3) as a white solid (7.33 g, 96% yield) (Figure 2) (Notes 18, 19, and 20).\nFigure 2.

A single-necked (14/20 joint) 250 mL round-bottomed reaction flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (2 cm, oval-shaped), a 5 mL (14/20 joint) round-bottomed flask, and a jacketed reflux condenser (14/20 joint) are dried in an oven (105 \u00b0C) for 16 h. The 250 mL flask is capped with a septum and allowed to cool under a stream of dry argon. The jacketed reflux condenser is stoppered with the 5 mL round-bottomed flask, secured with a Keck clip, capped with a septum, and allowed to cool to room temperature under a stream of argon (Note 21). Both sets of glassware are brought into the glovebox (Note 22).\nIn the glovebox, the 250 mL reaction flask is charged sequentially with N-methyl-N-phenyl benzamide (3) (7.4 g, 35 mmol, 1.0 equiv), 1,3-bis(2,6-di-i-propylphenyl)imidazolidin-2-ylidene (SIPr) (1.4 g, 3.6 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 23) and Ni(cod)2 (1.07 g, 3.90 mmol, 0.11 equiv) (Note 24). The condenser is disconnected from the 5 mL protection flask, and fitted to the 250 mL reaction flask, which is secured using a Keck clip, and the assembled glassware is transferred out of the glovebox (Note 25) into a fume hood. The septum at the top of the reflux condenser is pierced with a needle (18G) connected to an argon manifold, and with another needle (18G) that is connected to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler. The atmosphere is maintained under a slight positive pressure of argon for the duration of the reaction. Under a positive pressure of argon, the Keck clip is removed, and the joint between the flask and condenser is sealed with Teflon tape, then the Keck clip is mounted again. Toluene (35 mL, 1.0 M) (Note 26) is added to the reaction vessel via a plastic syringe fitted with an 18G needle. Finally, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-1-ol (4) (6.2 mL, 43 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 27) is added via a plastic syringe fitted with a 21G needle (Note 28). The condenser is attached to a running water line, and the reaction flask is then placed in an oil bath maintained at 110 \u00b0C and stirred for 24 h (250 rpm).\nFigure 3. Step B, part 1 reaction setup (photo provided by submitters)\n\nAfter 24 h, the reaction flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to 23 \u00b0C (Note 29). The reflux condenser is removed from the flask and replaced with a 100 mL (14/24 joint) pressure equalizing addition funnel ((Note 30), Figure 4) under an atmosphere of argon. The addition funnel was charged with TBAF (100 mL, 1.0 M in THF, 2.8 equiv) (Note 31) via a plastic syringe fitted with a 18G needle. The TBAF solution is then added dropwise through the addition funnel to the stirring solution (250 rpm) over 25 min at 23 \u00b0C.\nFigure 4. Step B, part ii reaction setup A) before addition of TBAF and B) after the addition of TBAF (photo provided by submitters)\n\nAfter stirring for an additional 3-3.5 h (250 rpm), the reaction is determined to be complete by TLC analysis (Note 32). Aqueous NaOH (1.0 M, 70 mL) (Note 33) is added to the reaction flask, and the mixture is stirred for 10 min at 23 \u00b0C. The resulting mixture is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel (24/40 joint), and is diluted with deionized water (150 mL), saturated aqueous NaCl solution (100 mL), and ethyl acetate (200 mL) (Note 34). The organic and aqueous layers are separated (Note 35). The organic layer is extracted with 0.5 M NaOH (2 x 100 mL), and the combined aqueous layers are washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL). The aqueous layer is then acidified to pH 2 with 3.0 M HCl (130 mL) (Note 9). The resulting aqueous layer is then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (100 mL), dried over Na2SO4 (31 g) (Note 10), filtered through a fritted B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 11) into a 1 L round-bottomed collection flask, and concentrated under reduced pressure via a rotary evaporator (Note 36). The resulting residue is dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) (Note 37) and purified by flash column chromatography (Note 38). The eluate containing the product (Note 39) is concentrated under reduced pressure (Note 40) on a rotary evaporator which affords benzoic acid (5) as a white solid (3.82 g, 89% yield) (Figure 5) (Notes 41, 42, and 43).\nFigure 5.

An oven-dried, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (14/23, 19/26, 14/23 ground glass joints) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3.5 \u00d7 1.0 cm, egg-shaped), is charged with (S)-dimethyl 2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)pentanedioate (1) (3.00 g, 10.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) (Notes 2 and 3). The flask is fitted with a vacuum adapter (14/23 ground glass joint) that is connected to a double manifold, while the other two necks are stoppered with glass stoppers (19/26 and 14/23 ground glass joints) (Figure 1A). The flask is evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with argon three times. Under a flow of argon, the center 19/26 glass stopper is replaced by a rubber septum, which is pierced with a 21G needle connected to the argon line, and an 18G needle connected to an oil bubbler. The other 14/23 glass stopper is replaced under argon by a glass thermometer adapter (14/23 ground glass joint), fitted with a low temperature thermometer (Figure 1B). Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (45 mL, 0.24 M) (Note 4) is added in one portion at room temperature via a plastic syringe fitted with a 18G needle through the rubber septum under argon. The flask is cooled to -78\u00b11 \u00b0C using a dry ice/acetone bath in a Dewar flask (Figure 1C) (Note 5). After 10 min, a solution of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide 1.0 M in THF (24 mL, 24 mmol, 2.2 equiv) (Note 6) is added dropwise via a plastic syringe fitted with a 18G needle over the course of 25 min under a positive flow of argon.

            "The drive toward increasing the fraction of sp3 carbons in drug candidate molecules and the groundswell of academic interest in the development of visible light-driven synthetic methods has substantially increased the popularity of radical-based approaches to organic synthesis.4,5 Studies using photoactive reagents in concert with LEDs have given rise to the highly popular field of \"photoredox catalysis\", which has unlocked modes of reactivity not observed in two-electron processes.6 These odd-electron processes are not beholden to the inherent limitations of polar reactions, enabling bonds to be constructed in the presence of acidic or basic functional groups. In a watershed moment in 2014, Molander7a and MacMillan7b independently reported on the union of photoredox catalysis with transition metal-mediated catalysis (primarily Ni, though integration with Pd8a and Au8b had been previously reported). This resulted in an array of new methods for Csp3 cross-coupling reactions (Figure 1).5,7c,7d,7e Indeed, industry has quickly adopted these platforms, allowing more chemical space to be surveyed on shorter timelines.9 Recent efforts to develop continuous flow adaptations of these couplings have allowed the transition from the discovery chemistry arena to process chemistry applications.10 The mechanistic pathways of these cross-couplings have been found to involve either Ni0/NiII/NiIII or Ni0/NiII/NiIII switches, depending on the structure of the radical involved.11 Importantly, the origin of the radical in this process could be largely ignored so long as: (a) the photocatalyst's excited state is sufficiently oxidizing to promote substrate level oxidation and (b) the rate of homolytic fragmentation of the radical precursor aligns with the elementary cross-coupling steps of the Ni catalytic cycle. The combined efforts of several groups have resulted in the identification of a suite of carbon radical precursors for this purpose that are derived from diverse chemical feedstocks.6,7\nFigure 1. Overview of Ni/photoredox cross-coupling\n\nIn the mid 2010s, Molander12a and Festerbank12b reported a representative protocol for the synthesis of one such class of radical precursor: alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates (referred to hereafter as \"organosilicates\"). These reagents, which were originally investigated by Frye and co-workers in the 1960s,13 can be easily prepared from catechol and trialkoxysilanes (typically the trimethoxy variant). These alkoxysilane precursors are widely available and remarkably inexpensive on account of their industrial-scale use in materials applications.14 Depending on the conditions employed, organosilicates can be obtained as dialkylammonium, trialkylammonium, or potassium salts. Because of the native insolubility of the latter, 18-crown-6 is added to improve solubility in organic solvents.12b Regardless of the counterion employed, the resulting organosilicate reagents are capable of facile photoredox-mediated oxidative homolysis to yield primary, secondary or tertiary carbon-centered radicals.\nFigure 2. Some recent developments in organosilicate chemistry\n\nAs compared to their contemporary radical precursors, these organosilicate reagents have several attractive properties for photoredox applications: (1) low oxidation potentials (0.6-0.9 V) that are a function of the catechol unit rather than the alkyl fragment; (2) lack of any acidic byproducts (i.e., BF3) that are potentially detrimental to reaction efficiency; (3) a wide diversity of commercially available, inexpensive trialkoxysilanes that can be used to make these reagents; and (4) ease of entry into traditionally difficult-to-generate primary radicals.15 At the time of our original Organic Syntheses submission, only a handful of applications of these organosilicate reagents were known. Since that time, numerous examples of their use in ever more complex transformations have been reported (Figure 2). This addendum will highlight some of the innovations in this area.\nBis(catecholato) Silicates in Radical-Polar Crossover Processes\nDespite the aforementioned utility, radicals are constrained by the inherent nature of odd electron reactivity. Certain processes such as unaided addition to carbonyl species are not possible in a general sense.16 Radical-polar crossover (RPC) processes allow synthetic chemists to tap into both homolytic and heterolytic chemistries in the same flask.17 The crux of this approach is a single-electron transfer event that converts the radical intermediate into an ionic species without impairing the reactivity of either. Successful RPC processes allow the integration of diverse, orthogonally reactive functional groups and complex catalytic cycles. Classical variations of RPC reactions typically involved use of Kagan's reagent (SmI2).18 However, its high cost, strong reduction potential, and oxygen sensitivity limits its widespread synthetic utility. Photoredox catalysis enables the RPC model to be a more powerful tool for synthesis by allowing for the judicious selection of reagents with appropriate redox potentials, which enables a broad palette of transformations. Two \"modes\" of RPC are accessible using photoredox catalysis, depending on the polar intermediate involved (Figure 3). In Mode 1, the RPC process is initiated by a single electron oxidation of a substrate to give an alkyl radical, which then engages in the desired radical reaction. The resulting adduct undergoes a reduction to give an anion which can engage an electrophile in a polar step. In Mode 2, the order of electron transfer is reversed. The first step is a single electron reduction to yield an alkyl radical which can still engage in odd-electron reactivity. Single electron oxidation then produces a cationic species that can be captured by a nucleophile. Both modes can either be net-neutral (i.e., no external oxidant or reductant is needed) or net-reductive/oxidative (e.g., use of Hantzch ester or DIPEA as electron sources for a reduction step).17 In terms of organosilicate chemistry, only Mode 1-type processes have been reported (detailed below).\nFigure 3. General modes of RPC\n\nRadical Polar Crossover Enables Defluorinative Alkylation\nIn 2015 Fensterbank, Ollivier, and co-workers demonstrated that organosilicates were competent reagents in photoredox-mediated Giese addition with an array of alkenes.12b Mechanistically, this proceeds via a RPC event, with the polar aspect of this process being the protonation of the resulting carbanion. Although their seminal work in this area used an Ir-based photocatalyst, they later reported that the organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN19 is also effective.20a The authors also demonstrated that a radical addition/elimination mechanism was possible when using allylic sulfones as Giese acceptors. Derat, Ollivier, and Fensterbank also demonstrated that aryl organosilicates could also be used in this radical alkylation process.20b With this precedent in mind, Molander and co-workers used organosilicate reagents in RPC olefin functionalization reactions. Their first success was the development of a defluorinative alkylation (DFA) protocol. Using perfluoroalkyl substituted alkenes, Molander demonstrated that radicals derived from organosilicates (and other radical precursors) readily add into these olefins yielding destabilized \u03b1-perfluoroalkyl radicals, which are prone to SET reduction (Figure 4, top).21 From there, facile E1cB-type elimination yields the gem-difluoroalkene or related species, thus constituting the polar step of the RPC process. The three radical progenitors used in this report (\u03b1-silylamines, organotrifluoroborates, and organosilicates) provided access to an array of gem-difluoroalkenes, with organosilicates being apt for the generation of non-stabilized primary radicals. This process was extended to aryl radicals generated by halogen atom abstraction.22\nFigure 4. Defluorinative alkylation (DFA) via RPC\n\nAs part of this report21 and a follow up paper,23 Molander and co-workers described a new organotrifluoroborate reagent, R1, for the rapid assembly of the trifluoromethyl-substituted styrenes used in these DFA reactions. This reagent was key for the synthesis of more complex CF3 alkenes which would later be used as part of a larger study interfacing DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) technology with photoredox processes (Figure 4, bottom).24 In a collaboration with Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Molander and co-workers demonstrated that the DFA process could be executed with organosilicates in a mixture of DMSO/H2O using several on-DNA trifluoromethyl substituted alkenes. The success of organosilicates here was surprising given that they generally degrade in aqueous organic mixtures via hydrolysis. It is likely that the rate of radical addition and the large excess of organosilicates used in these \"on DNA reactions\" helped overcome this limitation.\nCyclopropanation via Organosilicate Mediated Radical Polar Crossover\nSeeking to further advance the RPC model using organosilicates, Molander and co-workers sought to interrupt the E1cB process observed in the aforementioned DFA to enable radical polar annulation reactions (RPARs). More specifically, they sought to develop a platform for the construction of cyclopropanes via radical intermediates. The use of radicals in cyclopropanation reactions was not without precedent, but the prior art developed at the time of Molander's work was contingent on a radical based ring closure. This precedent reported by Suero and co-workers used non-redox neutral SET reduction of CH2I2 to generate an iodomethyl radical.25 The latter odd-electron species could engage in Giese type addition into olefins, ultimately leading to SH2-type ring closure to effect cyclopropanation. In contrast, Molander's approach focused on the development of a redox neutral method for cyclopropanation using a photooxidizable C1 reagent, triethylammonium bis(catecholato)iodomethylsilicate, R2 (Figure 5).26 This bifunctional reagent27 and related species detailed later in this addendum demonstrate a unique advantage of organosilicates: the capability to easily prepare derivatives that are precursors of halogen-containing primary alkyl radicals which can be used as handles in situ ring closure (as detailed below). R2 was prepared in a two-step process from inexpensive chloromethyltrimethoxysilane via a Finkelstein reaction using a protocol adapted from the parent article of this addendum. This reagent undergoes SET oxidation to produce an iodomethyl radical that engages in Giese addition onto a suitable olefin. However, since the redox environment of the resulting radical is drastically different (i.e., the first step produced a now strongly reducing species). As such, the Giese adduct undergoes SET reduction to produce an anion which is primed for 3-exo-tet ring closure. Although the initial focus of this work was on the generation of a library of trifluoromethylsubstituted cyclopropanes, the reaction was expanded to an array of Giese-type acceptors and styrenes. Following this report, the laboratories of Jin and Fang reported on a similar approach using potassium halomethylsilicates and activated olefins (such as vinyl silanes,28a boronates,28b and phosphates28c).\nFigure 5. Development of an organosilicate cyclopropanation reagent\n\nBromomethyl organosilicate reagents have also been shown to be effective in cyclopropanation reactions.28d Although R2 was enabling for facile olefin cyclopropanation, a more general approach for organosilicate-mediated cyclopropane construction was pursued. Rather than building the electrophilic component of the RPAR process into the organosilicate itself (thus restricting the process to the installation of a methylene unit), the olefin containing species could be appended with a leaving group. Using this approach, any photocatalytically generated radical would be able to induce cyclization upon radical addition and single-electron reduction, presuming a redox neutral photocatalytic platform was employed (Figure 6). Using a homoallylic tosylate (assembled using a Suzuki reaction between the corresponding vinyl bromide and a borylated arene), Molander, Kelly, and co-workers identified conditions that enabled facile RPAR-type cyclopropanation using a propylacetoxysilicate.29 The identified conditions were not a far departure from the conditions used with R2, but a higher dilution factor seemed to improve yields. An array of organosilicates and homoallyic tosylates were competent in this reaction, affording good yields of the corresponding 1,1-disubstituted cyclopropanes. To support their conjecture that the origin of the radical was independent of the success of cyclopropanation, the authors demonstrated that other radical precursors such as organotrifluoroborates and dihydropyridines were also amenable to RPAR cyclopropanation. Likewise, Aggarwal and co-workers also disclosed a report verifying the feasibility of this approach with carboxylic acid radical precursors.30 In a subsequent publication, Molander and Kelly demonstrated that organosilicates (and other radical progenitors) could be used in RPAR cyclopropanation with cycloalkane-embedded homoallylic tosylates to assemble polycyclic cyclopropanes.31 This report used an array of organosilicates and proceeded in good yield with a various homoallylic tosylates, including those derived from heterocyclic systems.\nFigure 6. Utilizing the RPAR model for cyclopropanation of olefins\n\nEngaging Imines in Organosilicate Mediated RPC\nThe success in employing organosilicate reagents in Giese-type additions to polarized alkenes motivated Molander and co-workers to explore addition reactions to aldimines. In 2017, they reported that irradiating an imine with a slight excess of organosilicate reagent in the presence of 4CzIPN resulted in facile alkylation.32 This method serves as a mild, highly functional group-tolerant alternative to classical approaches for secondary amine synthesis, such as organometallic additions to aldimines or reductive amination. Molander and co-workers later expanded upon this work by using imines in an RPAR-type process.33 A bifunctional 3-bromopropylsilicate reagent was effective in converting a range of aldimines to the corresponding pyrrolidines and piperidines (Figure 7A). N-Aryl imines were most effective in the transformation, whereas N-sulfonyl imines were less effective. This may suggest that photoexcitation of the imine substrate or formation of an electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex with the organosilicate reagent may be promoting the reaction.34 A limitation of this work is the need for aromatic aldimines. In attempts to expand the scope of imines, Friestad demonstrated that MgCl2 can be used as a Lewis acid additive for the radical alkylation of hydrazones derived from both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes.35\nFigure 7. (a) RPC-mediated carbonylation (b) Saturated nitrogen heterocycles via RPAR\n\nCarbonylation via Radical Polar Crossover with Organosilicates\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an established radical acceptor,36 thus, running radical additions under high pressure of carbon monoxide enables acyl radical generation. Fensterbank exploited this propensity and the ability of acyl radicals to engage in Giese-type addition for an elegant synthesis of unsymmetrical ketones (Figure 7B).37 The reaction uses organosilicate-derived alkyl radicals to add to CO, after which the resultant acyl radicals engage activated olefins in Giese addition. A final SET allows for the regeneration of the photocatalyst and the desired product by protonation. A range of Giese acceptors and alkyl radicals were tolerated in this process.\nAdvances using Ni/Photoredox Dual Catalysis\nSince the publication of the parent Organic Syntheses protocol, advances have been made when using organosilicates in Ni/photoredox cross-coupling. For example, Vertex reported38 a flow chemistry approach wherein reaction times could be substantially shortened in these types of cross-coupling reactions, presumably due to improved light penetration.10\nOther Electrophiles: Some innovations have been disclosed with respect to types of electrophilic partners used with organosilicates. Fensterbank and Ollivier recently described a protocol for cross-coupling with 1,1-dichlorostyrenes in a stereoselective manner.39 The conditions used in their approach were in accord with prior reports, wherein 4CzIPN in conjunction with a simple Ni/dtbbpy system were employed. A near identical system was used by Molander to selectively engage borylated aryl halides in cross-coupling.40 Here, the authors demonstrated that Csp2-Csp3 cross coupling could be executed at the halogenated site and paired with a downstream Pd-mediated Suzuki-type coupling. Molander also explored the possibility of executing a \"haloselective\" cross-coupling using polyfunctional linchpins. In their report, a Ni/Ru metallophotoredox process for the chemoselective Csp2-Csp3 cross coupling of bromo(iodo)arenes using organosilicates is described.41 Optimization revealed that phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2\u2032-bipyridine gave the best selectivity and yield. The authors demonstrated that these polyhalogenated systems could be sequentially functionalized without need to isolate the intermediate mono-alkylated product; that is, two distinct Csp2-Csp3 bonds could be forged in one pot. Lastly, acyl chlorides were competent electrophiles in this paradigm, affording the desired asymmetrical ketones in moderate to good yields.42\nAlthough most of the literature surrounding organosilicates in Ni/photoredox cross-coupling relates to Csp2-Csp3 linkages, Fensterbank, Ollivier, and co-workers disclosed an approach to Csp3-Csp3 bond formation.43 One of the major challenges with this type of cross-coupling is the inherent competition between homocoupling of the electrophilic partner (or radical-radical homocoupling itself). Although unable to find conditions to suppress these undesirable pathways, the authors identified conditions which afforded usable yields of primary and secondary alkyl bromides with primary and secondary alkyl radicals (derived from silicates). In this case, a Ni0 source was necessary, as was a Ir-based photocatalyst.\nFigure 8. Ni-mediated olefin dicarbofunctionalization\n\nDicarbofunctionalization of Olefins: Nevado and co-workers successfully explored the merger of radical addition reactions with photoredox/Ni dual cross-couplings, yielding a synthetically useful three-component dicarbofunctionalization of olefins.44 A key factor for this transformation was the ratio between alkene and alkyl organosilicate, where an excess of either favors the more traditional difunctionalized product. As often observed with alkyl organosilicates, the functional group tolerance was excellent. This reaction was further extended to other radical precursors to give functionalized products such as unsymmetrical sulfones.\nFigure 9. Amide construction via Ni/photoredox dual catalysis\n\nAmidation via Isocyanates: Alternative ways of making amides are welcomed by the chemistry community due to the ubiquity of this bond. Molander reported an approach to the construction of amides via Ni-mediated additions onto isocyanates (Figure 9).45 This reaction required several modifications to more traditional alkyl organosilicate transformations, such as an alternative ligand (1,10-phenanthroline) as well as a tertiary ammonium counterion (to suppress isocyanate degradation). In contrast with other radical additions onto isocyanates, this protocol is characterized by mild conditions and the absence of a stoichiometric reductant, affording both alkyl/alkyl and alkyl/aryl amides in moderate to good yields.\nThioetherification: Although organosilicate-mediated thioetherification of aryl halides was described in the parent Organic Syntheses protocol,46 Molander and Petersson subsequently leveraged this reaction for modification of thiols relevant to chemical biology (Figure 10).47 Initially targeting arenes that could serve as biological probes or unprotected, biologically-derived thiols (such as tiopronin, glutathione, etc.), the true aim of this work was site-specific functionalization of unprotected cysteine residues on peptides. To demonstrate the feasibility of this objective, the authors performed a study wherein different amino acids were added to the standard thioetherification conditions to determine what, if any, impact they had on catalysis. In nearly all cases, these additives were tolerated up to 1 equiv. The authors showed that nonamer peptide with an internal Cys residue could be chemoselectively arylated in under 90 min in in solution phase (DMF) (at a ten-fold dilution factor).\nFigure 10. Organosilicate-mediated thioarylation of biomolecules\n\nConcluding Remarks\nOrganosilicates like the one described in the parent article to this Addendum are powerful reagents for C-C bond construction. Using photocatalysis, these pentacoordinate silicon species can be oxidized to yield alkyl radicals via C-Si homolysis. These radicals can be funneled into RPC regimes or intercepted by low valent nickel complexes for cross-coupling protocols. Furthermore, alkyl radicals generated in this process can be used for H-atom transfer reactions with thiols to yield thiyl radicals. In addition, the simple yet robust nature of this class of radical precursor allowed for the development of a new reagent for cyclopropanation of olefins. It is anticipated that as our understanding of radical processes advance, so too will the opportunities for organosilicates to advance the state of the art in chemical synthesis."

An oven-dried round-bottomed flask (250 mL) (Note 2) containing a Teflon-coated magnetic bar (3 cm bar shape) is charged with DMSO (17 mL) (Note 3). D-Mannitol (98%) (12 g, 65.9 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 4) is added to the flask in small lots while stirring at 25-30 \u00b0C. A Teflon stopper is used when not adding reagents. The resulting turbid solution is stirred for the next 5 min. Cyclohexanone (15 mL, 145 mmol, 2.2 equiv) and triethyl orthoformate (3.3 mL, 19.8 mmol, 0.3 equiv) are each added in one portion by syringe with an interval of 2 min (Note 5). Boron trifluoride etherate solution (0.7 mL, 5.7 mmol, 0.09 equiv) is then added to the flask with a glass syringe (Notes 5, 6, and 7). The colorless, turbid solution is stirred at room temperature (25-30 \u00b0C) for 24 h. After this time, the turbidity dissipates, and a clear solution results at the end of the reaction. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Note 8) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. A) The reaction is started; B) After completion of the reaction; C) TLC at work up (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe reaction mixture is then neutralized by the slow addition of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (5 g in x 50 mL distilled water) while stirring at 20 \u00b0C. A small amount of heat and CO2 gas are liberated during the neutralization. Distilled water (150 mL) (Note 9) is added to this solution, and stirring is continued for 5 min, after which the stirring is stopped, and the flask is left undisturbed for 30 min. During this time, a white precipitate forms in the flask.\nFigure 2.

The lumps of solid are crushed into smaller pieces, and the solid is allowed to settle to the bottom of the beaker. The suspension is then filtered again using a B\u00fcchner funnel under a vacuum (90 mmHg). The filter cake is again suspended in distilled water (400 mL), and the solid is recovered again by filtration to provide 22.4 grams of solid.\nFigure 3. A) Product recovered by filtration; B) Solid after filtration (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe separated solid is added to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and is dissolved in ethyl acetate (170 mL), which results in a homogeneous solution. The ethyl acetate layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (20 g) while stirring for 30 min. The solution is then filtered through a plug of cotton directly into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. The filtrate is then concentrated using a rotary evaporator (30 \u00b0C, 35 mmHg) to provide a viscous liquid, which upon standing converts into a wax-like solid (Figure 4).\nFigure 4.

This provides a soft cake (Figure 7A), which is cut into pieces while the cake is wet (Figure 7B). The pieces of the cake are then transferred back into the 500 mL round-bottomed flask. The product is suspended in petroleum ether (400 mL), and the flask is heated to 75 \u00b0C to effect dissolution. The flask was allowed to cool to room temperature and left undisturbed for 16 h for crystallization to occur.

A 250-mL round-bottomed flask is charged with sodium periodate (3.25 g, 15.19 mmol, 1.3 equiv) and distilled water (30 mL) under ambient atmosphere. A Teflon stirring bar (2 cm bar-shaped) is added and the solution is stirred at ambient temperature until all the NaIO4 is dissolved. Diethyl ether (50 mL) is added to the flask, and 1,2:5,6-di-O-cyclohexylidene-D-mannitol (4 g, 11.68 mmol, 1 equiv) is added to the flask while stirring, to obtain a colorless biphasic mixture (Figure 8).

After the reaction is judged complete, the reaction mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel and the upper organic layer is collected in a 250 mL conical flask. The lower aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 20 mL). The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (10 g).

A 1L single-necked, round-bottomed flask (RBF) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (12 x 25 mm, oval) is charged with 4-bromoaniline (17.2 g, 99 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) followed by sodium cyanoborohydride (31.4 g, 499 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 3), which is then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (500 mL) (Note 4) by stirring (800 rpm, under air) for ~5 min at 23-25 \u00b0C. Paraformaldehyde (15 g, 499 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 5) is added to the 1L flask in one portion via funnel (Figure 1A). The flask is then sealed with a rubber septum and placed under nitrogen atmosphere. Glacial acetic acid (30 mL, 499 mmol, 5 equiv) (Note 6) is added dropwise via syringe over 10 min. The resulting mixture is allowed to stir (800 rpm) for 15 min before the reaction flask is put into an IKA heating block that is heated to 50 \u00b0C (Figure 1B). The reaction mixture is stirred at that temperature for 24 h. The flask is then removed from the heating block and allowed to cool to room temperature. Excess acetic acid in the resulting mixture is then quenched by slow addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (300 mL) (Note 7) and stirred until the vigorous bubbling ceases. The biphasic mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (200 mL) (Note 8) (Figure 1C). Once the layers are separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 250 mL) using a 2 L separatory funnel.

The reaction flask is placed in an ice bath (Figure 2A) and the solution is stirred (400 rpm) at 0 \u00b0C for 1 h. Basic alumina (39.8 g) (Note 19) is added to the reaction mixture and the resultant slurry is stirred for 15 min. The slurry is filtered through a 150 mL fritted funnel (24/40), and the filtered solution is concentrated (40 \u00b0C, 300 mmHg) on a rotary evaporator to yield a beige solid (Figure 2B).

The stirred solution is then charged with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O, 22.8 g, 104.7 mmol, 2.6 equiv) (Note 25), followed by 2,3-benzofuran (12.4 g, 105 mmol, 2.6 equiv) (Note 26) and then cooled to 0 \u00b0C by immersion in an ice bath (Figure 3A). After 10 min of stirring (400 rpm, 0 \u00b0C) the solution is charged with 4-(Dimethylamino)-pyridine (490 mg, 4.0 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 27). The resulting clear, light orange solution (Figure 3A) is stirred at that temperature for 1 h, whereupon the ice bath is removed and replaced with a dry ice-acetone bath (Figure 3B), further cooling the reaction mixture to -78 \u00b0C. After 20 min of stirring (400 rpm, -78 \u00b0C), a solution of tin(IV) chloride (1.0 M in dichloromethane, 10.1 mL, 10.06 mmol, 0.25 equiv) (Note 28) is slowly added to the reaction mixture.

The brown reaction mixture (Figure 3C) is then carefully poured over 1M aqueous sodium hydroxide (150 mL) (Note 29) and diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane (Note 30). The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (1 \u00d7 100 mL) in a 2 L separatory funnel (Figure 3D).

            "The intramolecular Rh(I)-catalyzed allenic Pauson-Khand reaction (APKR) is a powerful synthetic method for constructing ring-fused cyclopentenones. Our group's interest in the APKR extends back to 1992 when we submitted original research proposals for applications to academic positions. At that time, there were two independent reports of allenes being used in the PKR-only Aumann's demonstrated the feasibility of an intermolecular Fe(0)-catalyzed process.2a In 1994, Narasaka demonstrated three examples of an intramolecular APKR using allenyl sulfides and an iron carbonyl complex.3 In 1995, we reported a successful intramolecular APKR reaction of unfunctionalized allenes4 using stoichiometric Mo(CO)6-a transition metal complex that had recently been reported by Jeong for the enyne PKR.5 Also, in 1995, Narasaka reported trace amounts of a cycloadduct for a simple allene-yne using Fe(0)-catalysis,6 and Cazes successfully demonstrated an intermolecular APKR using Co2(CO)8 and NMO.7 In July of 2000, an undergraduate researcher, Brenden Rickards, working in our lab demonstrated a Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR using [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-a catalyst previously reported by Narasaka for an enyne PKR.8 This result established for the first time that a Rh(I) transition metal catalyst afforded complete selectivity for the distal double bond of the allene whereas Mo(CO)6 afforded selectivity for the proximal double bond affording a different constitutional isomer.\nIn 2001, while our group was expanding the scope of this unprecedented, catalyst-controlled double bond selectivity for Mo(0) and Rh(I) on a number of alkynyl allenes,9a,b including an APKR approach to the natural product guanacastepene A,9c Narasaka published a manuscript describing the scope and limitations of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed enyne PKR where he also described the reaction of a single alkynyl allene showing that the reaction occurred with the distal double bond.10 In early 2002, Dr. Hongfeng Chen, a postdoctoral fellow in our group, demonstrated that unfunctionalized allenes could be used in the APKR to form [5,7]-ring systems by exploiting the Rh(I) catalyst controlled double bond selectivity,9b and Mukai reported that allenyl sulfones could also be employed to prepare [5,7]-ring systems.11 This independent co-discovery of a metal catalyzed control of double bond selectivity to form seven-membered rings has inspired our group and others in the application of this powerful method for synthesizing complex molecular compounds.\nThis discussion addendum informs on a few recent advances made regarding expansion of the scope of the APKR and its application to target-oriented synthesis. We have divided this addendum into the following topics: Asymmetric Allenic Pauson-Khand Reaction; Transfer of Allene Axial Chirality in APKR; Rh(I)-Catalyzed APKR Double Bond Selectivity, Mechanism, and Reaction Optimization; and APKR Approach to Natural Products and Other Bioactive Compounds.\nAsymmetric Allenic Pauson-Khand Reaction\nBurrows, Jesikiewicz, Liu, and Brummond recently showed that through a combination of experiment and theory racemic allene-yne 1 could be transformed to bicyclo[5.3.0]decadienone 2 in 79% yield with an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio (er) using a chiral non-racemic Rh(I) catalyst (Scheme 1A).12 A transformation made possible through rapid scrambling of the axial chirality of the allenyl acetate under the reaction conditions and selective reaction of one enantiomer. This represents the first Rh(I)-catalyzed asymmetric carbocyclization reaction of this type outside of a 1,6-enyne. In contrast to more traditional catalyst design strategies involving high throughput experimentation, high enantioselectivity was realized after testing only seven different chiral catalysts using wet-lab experimentation-representing an immense savings in resources. The key to our success was a deep mechanistic understanding where experiment and computation informed selection of the next catalyst. For example, activation barriers for the enantioselectivity-determining oxidative cyclization step were computed to reveal the origins of catalyst reactivity (\u0394G\u2021) and selectivity (\u0394\u0394G\u2021) and experiments in a flask were performed to test catalyst efficiency (yield) and stereo-directing ability (er) (Scheme 1B). This mechanistically complex process involving a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) is a powerful demonstration of catalyst design made possible through the tight integration of experiment and computation.\nScheme 1. DyKAT process realized in the asymmetric APKR\n\nDeihl and Brummond expanded the asymmetric APKR to include furanyl tethered allene-ynes to access the core ring system present in the guaianolide natural product thapsigargin (Tg).13 The APKR of several furanyl tethered allene-ynes 4 afforded products 5 in good yields with high enantioselectivities when using the chiral monodentate ligand S-(3) (Scheme 2). Interestingly, while several allenyl carboxy groups were examined (Series B), only allenyl chloroacetates afforded products in upwards of 98% ee (Series A)! The group on the terminus of the alkyne played a key factor in the yield and enantioselectivity of the APKR with a terminal alkyne affording product in 32% yield and 54% ee and a phenyl alkyne affording product in 46% yield and 98% ee. The methyl-substituted alkyne with an allenyl chloroacetate afforded product in 57% yield and 94% ee. DFT calculations of this reaction show a favorable \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the furanyl ring and phosphoramidite ligand that lowers the energy of the transition state leading to the major product. The transition state leading to the minor enantiomer, lacks this favorable \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction.13\nScheme 2. APKR of furan-tethered allene-yne affording the Tg core\n\nTransfer of Allene Axial Chirality in the APKR\nThe transfer of chiral information from the allene to the cyclocarbonylation product for the APKR of non-racemic allenes has also been demonstrated. Grillet and Brummond showed that reacting enantioenriched 1,3,3-trisubstituted allenes 6 and 8 to the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR afforded bicyclo[5.3.0]decadienone products 7 and 9 with complete transfer of chiral information for 17 substrates (Scheme 3A).14 Success was realized for allene-ynes having variety of groups on the alkyne terminus (Me, Ph, H, TMS, 2-, 3-thiophenyl, cyclopropyl), allene (Ph, Me, n-Bu, SiMe2Ph), and tether (X = NTs, C(CO2Et)2,O). In the case of 1,3-disubstituted allenes, the degree of chirality transferred depended upon the tether identity and the alkynyl group (Scheme 3B). For example, allene-yne 10a (X = NTs, R= TMS) afforded 11a in 83% yield in 84% ee, whereas allene-yne 10b (X = C(CO2Et)2, R= TMS) and 10c (X = O, R= TMS) provided the products 11b and 11c in good yield but with 50% and 22% ee, respectively. Reaction monitoring using chiral HPLC analysis provided strong evidence for scrambling of the axial chirality of the allenyl precursor and not epimerization of the APKR product. Scrambling of the axial chirality of the allene is postulated to involve an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the rhodium complexed allene by the heteroatom in the tether (Scheme 3C).14\nScheme 3. Transfer of allene axial chirality in the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR to access bicyclo[5.3.0]decadienones enantioselectively\n\nMa and coworkers have shown that chiral non-racemic 1,3-disubstituted allenes 12 afford bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienones 13 with complete transfer of chirality (Scheme 4).15 Low reaction temperatures and silver salt additives were critical to the success of the preferred mechanistic pathway affording the cyclocarbonylation product. Higher temperatures in the absence of silver hexafluoroantimonate afforded the corresponding cross conjugated triene via a formal Alder-ene process. High yields and enantiospecificities were reported for the APKR of ten allene-ynes.\nScheme 4. Transfer of allene axial chirality in the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR to access chiral non-racemic bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienones\n\nRh(I)-Catalyzed APKR Double Bond Selectivity, Mechanism, and Reaction Optimization\nRhodium and molybdenum are the most used transition metals for catalyzing the intramolecular APKR with each showing a different reactivity preference towards the double bonds of the allene. For example, rhodium biscarbonyl chloride dimer [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 reacts preferentially with the distal double bond of the allenes 14 and 17 to afford products 15 and 18, while molybdenum hexacarbonyl [Mo(CO)6] reacts with the proximal double bond to afford 16 and 19. This transition metal controlled selectivity has been used to form either \u03b1-methylene cyclopentenone or 4-alkylidene cyclopentenone products (Scheme 5).9a,b\nScheme 5. Catalyst-controlled double bond selectivity for APKR\n\nThe preferential reactivity of one double bond over the other has been described using Density Functional Theory (DFT) where calculations show the metal geometry in the oxidative cyclization (OxCycl) transition state-the rate determining step in the reaction energy profile-as a key control element.16 For example, the rhodium catalyzed reaction shows an early transition state (TS) with all low energy TS structures for the OxCycl step having a four-coordinate rhodium metal complexed to the distal allene double bond (TS-1) and adopting a slightly distorted square planar geometry to afford metallocycle 22 (Scheme 6A). Whereas all low energy TS structures for the OxCycl step for the five-coordinate molybdenum having a trigonal bipyramidal geometry show the proximal double bond as complexing to the axial position due to conformational constraints (not shown) The CO insertion step was found to be the rate-determining step for molybdenum; however, the free energy of this step was lower than that for the OxCycl of the metal to the distal double bond of the allene (not shown).16\nScheme 6. DFT studies on the oxidative cyclization step of the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR and asymmetric APKR\n\nThe computed reaction energy profile for the asymmetric Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR shows the oxidative cyclization step as stereo- but not rate-determining (Scheme 6B).12 Complexation of the allene-yne to the resting state of the catalyst 24 occurs with the loss of two CO's to afford 25 having a square planar geometry which is 7.7 kcal/mol lower in energy than the square-based pyramidal complex 26, which results from the loss of one CO (Scheme 6B). Nonetheless, the OxCycl step for the five-coordinate TS-3 has a lower calculated activation barrier than the four-coordinate TS-4 by 4.3 kcal/mol. Stabilization of TS-3 (18-electron) over TS-4 (16-electron) by the additional CO ligand was attributed to the acetoxy group on the allene. Interestingly, DFT predicts that both reaction pathways afford the same enantiomeric product. Whereas, in the Rh(I)-catalyzed PKR of enynes, the reaction pathways involving the four- and five-coordinate complexes afford different enantiomeric products.17\nDuring application of the APKR involving an early-stage installation of C4 and C10 methyl groups present in the 6,12-guaianolides, a byproduct was formed in substantial quantities for methyl substituted allenes and alkynes as well as terminal alkynes. 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry analysis supported a byproduct resulting from a dimerization of the allene-yne precursor 28. Performing the reaction by dropwise addition of allene-ynes 28 to the Rh(I) catalyst under Conditions B (0.01 M) gave an 80% yield of 29, much higher than Conditions A which afforded 29 in 32% yield. High yields were afforded for nearly all substrates examined when using these modified conditions (Scheme 7).18 These same conditions were used for APKR protocol published in Organic Syntheses on a 6-g scale in 88% yield using 1 mol% of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2.19\nScheme 7. Optimized conditions for Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR\n\nAPKR Approach to Natural Products and Other Bioactive Compounds\nThe APKR is a key step in the synthesis of the core structure of several natural products and other bioactive compounds. Jackson and Brummond demonstrated that the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR of lactam tethered allene-ynes 32 enabled rapid access to several guaianolide analogs 33, which are equipped with an electronically tunable covalent reactive group, an \u03b1-methylene\u2212\u03b3-lactam (Scheme 8A).20 These analogs were designed for tunable thiol reactivity thus enabling an understanding of structure activity relationships for bioactive compounds with an \u03b1-methylene\u2212\u03b3-lactone that are otherwise too reactive. Reaction of compound 33 with excess cysteamine showed thiol addition with half-lives ranging from seconds to days depending upon the electronics of the R2 group.\nScheme 8. APKR approach to guaianolide analogs with tunable thiol reactivity and bioactivity\n\nDempe and Brummond have shown that reaction of cis and trans-annulated lactams 35 to the Rh(I) conditions afforded APKR products 36 in yields ranging from 47-85% (Scheme 8B). Reaction times for the APKR varied considerably across this series of lactams with the trans-allene-ynes reacting 2-4\u00d7 faster than the cis-isomers. Furthermore, lactam 36 reacted with excess glutathione 10x faster than cis-annulated lactams under biologically relevant conditions (Scheme 8B).21 DFT calculations revealed this higher reactivity of the trans-annulated stereoisomer is due to release of ring strain in the thiol-Michael addition transition state. These studies support the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactam as a novel covalent reactive group and its value in the rational design of inhibitors by having thiol reactivity within a range of the widely used and therapeutically proven acrylamide.21,22\nIn 2022, the Li group reported the first use of APKR of an unfunctionalized allene 38 to form an eight-membered-ring to achieve the asymmetric total synthesis of hypoestin A, albolic acid, and ceroplastol II from the common intermediate 40 (Scheme 9).23,24 Several rhodium catalysts and additives were screened identifying the standard APKR conditions ([(Rh(CO)2Cl]2, toluene, CO balloon, 110 \u00b0C) as optimal for achieving the 5,8,5-ring system 39 in 56% yield. The APKR could be performed reliably on a 2-g scale and the generality of the method was demonstrated on ten additional substrates with various functionality affording 5,8,5-ring systems in 40-86% yields.\nScheme 9. APKR approach to a 5,8,5-ring system\n\nIn 2021, the Poulsen group reported an APKR on an allene-ynamide 41 to deliver the azabicyclo[4.3.0] core 42 via reaction with the distal double bond of the allene in 66% yield. This reaction was performed on a gram-scale using either a constant flow of CO (10% CO mixed with 90% argon) or COgen-a bench stable CO precursor-in a two-chamber system to generate carbon monoxide in situ. Compound 42 was taken on to afford concise syntheses of streptazone A, and abikoviromycin (Scheme 10).25\nScheme 10. APKR approach to 5,6-ring system-Total synthesis of streptazone A and abikoviromycin\n\nThe Li group used an APKR of benzyloxyallene-yne 43 to construct the 5,7,6,5- tetracyclic ring system 44 in the total synthesis of sterically compact bufospirostenin A (Scheme 11).26 Extensive experimentation revealed that the ligand additive 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) and the syringe pump addition of allene-yne to the rhodium catalyst afforded the desired product in 85% yield as a 2:1 mixture of diastereomers separable by column chromatography on large scale (>20 g).\nScheme 11. APKR approach to 5,7,6,5-ring system\n\nIn 2017, the Grenning group combined a deconjugative propargylation and a Cope rearrangement to afford 45, which was reacted to the Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR to rapidly assemble the 6,7,5-ring system of 46-a terpenoid core represented in several natural products including brevifoliol and radianspene C (Scheme 12).27\nScheme 12. Rapid assembly of 6,7,5-ring system of a terpenoid core\n\nThe Yang group reported using ene-allene 47 in a Rh(I)-catalyzed cyclocarbonylation reaction to from a tricyclic core 48 as a single isomer that was used to complete the total synthesis of perforanoid A (Scheme 13).28 The use of an ene-allene in this transformation was the result of an alkyne isomerization prior to the cyclocarbonylation which ultimately afforded the desired product as that of an enyne due to isomerization of the double bond into conjugation with the ketone. While not technically an APKR, the high yielding cyclocarbonylation of ene-allene 47 demonstrates the extraordinary scope, and potential, of the Rh(I)-catalysis conditions.\nScheme 13. Cyclocarbonylation of ene-allene\n\nBaran and coworkers have demonstrated the APKR of allene-yne 49 to prepare 50 which was used in the total syntheses of ingenol and phorbol (Scheme 14).29, 30 Protection of the diol as silyl ethers, high temperature, and high dilution conditions were essential to this high yielding APKR on gram scale.\nScheme 14. APKR approach to a 5,7-ring system\n\nArdisson and coworkers have shown that a Rh(I)-catalyzed APKR performed using racemic allene-yne 51 affords the 5,7-ring system of the tricyclic 52 in 71% yield in an approach to the natural product thapsigargin (Scheme 15).31 The structure of 52 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The APKR conditions were modified to include 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp). These conditions have previously been demonstrated to give a dramatic yield enhancement for some allene-ynes, including: allenyl carbamates, and benzyl and para-methoxy benzyl ethers. Interestingly, the catalyst and ligand were added successively to the allene-yne whereas most protocols involve the addition of the allene-yne to the Rh(I)-catalyst.32, 33\nScheme 15. APKR approach to a 5,7-ring system of thapsigargin\n\nIn summary, the APKR has played an important role in target-oriented organic synthesis. And, amongst different metals including Fe, Mo, and Co being used as the catalyst in APKR, Rh is the most prominent in the recent advances in this area. Finally, for additional insight and information on the APKR several reviews have been published.34"

(Diacetoxyiodo)benzene (28.18 g, 87.5 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 5) is then added in four roughly equal portions (over a period of 5 min), allowing for controlled decarboxylation (Figure 1a). The reaction mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C (ambient temperature) for 3 h, during which time the reaction mixture turns from colorless to pale yellow (Figure 1b). The reaction progress can be monitored by TLC (Note 6).\nFigure 1. a) Decarboxylation of ammonium carbamate; b) Reaction mixture after 3 h; c) Reaction mixture after removal of methanol (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure (25 \u00baC, 35 mmHg) to give a yellow slurry (Figure 1c), which is diluted with EtOAc (150 mL) (Note 7) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL) (Note 8), and then stirred for 30 min to neutralize the acetic acid formed during the reaction. The resulting biphasic solution is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel, rinsing the flask with EtOAc (50 mL). The layers are separated, and the organic layer is washed with distilled H2O (100 mL) to remove residual ammonium carbamate. The layers are separated. The combined aqueous fractions are extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL) and subjected to the subsequent workup procedure to yield additional product. The organic fraction is extracted with aqueous 1M HCl (3 x 100 mL) (Figure 2a). The acidic aqueous layers (pH \u2248 1) are combined, transferred to a clean separatory funnel, and washed with CH2Cl2 (3 x 100 mL) (Note 9). The aqueous fraction is then basified to pH \u2248 12 with aqueous 2M NaOH (200 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (ca. 20 g) (Note 10). The solution is filtered through a 7 cm glass funnel plugged with cotton wool and the Na2SO4 is washed with CH2Cl2 (50 mL) into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask (Figure 2b). The organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure (25 \u00b0C, 250 mmHg), and the flask is then placed under high vacuum (21 \u00b0C, 0.11 mmHg) for 18 h to remove any residual solvent to yield (4-bromophenyl)(imino)(methyl)-\u03bb6-sulfanone (2) as a white solid (5.22 g, 63%, 98% purity) (Figure 2c) (Notes 11, 12 and 13).\nFigure 2. a) Extraction using aqueous HCl (1M); b) Product in CH2Cl2 after work up; c) Final compound 2 (photos provided by checkers)"

A single-necked, 2 L, 29/32 round-bottomed flask is charged with a 4-cm by 1.5-cm Teflon-coated football-shaped stir bar and charged with methylene chloride (750 mL) (Note 2) under air, measured using a 1 L graduated cylinder and introduced into the reaction vessel through a 350 mL plastic funnel. The funnel is removed from the flask. Stirring is initiated (500 rpm), and N-Boc-hydroxylamine (1, 25.0 g, 0.188 mol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 3) is added. After stirring at room temperature (Note 4) for 5 min, isoprene (14.1 mL, 0.141 mol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 5) is added by a 24 mL plastic syringe to the round-bottomed flask over the course of 30 sec. Next, the flask is submerged to just above the solvent line in a 0 \u00b0C ice/water bath (Note 6) and stirring is continued for 10 min prior to addition of (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (60.6 g, 0.188 mol, 1.3 equiv), (Note 7) which is introduced over the course of 15 sec. The flask is capped with a 29/32 rubber septum. To prevent over-pressurization, a 5.5-cm, 18-gauge disposable needle is then inserted through the septum (Figure 1A). The reaction is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at 0 \u00b0C (Note 8). After the septum is removed, saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (150 mL) (Note 9) is added to the reaction solution at 0 \u00b0C over 30 sec. After the ice bath is removed, the reaction mixture is stirred at 500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature (Figure 1B).

A three-necked, 1 L round-bottom flask (main neck: 29/32 joint, side necks: 15/25 joint) (Flask A) is equipped with a 4-cm by 1.5-cm Teflon-coated football-shaped stir bar. Two additional three-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flasks (main neck: 29/32 joint, side necks: 15/25 joint) (Flasks B and C) are equipped with 3-cm by 1.5-cm Teflon-coated football-shaped stir bars. One side neck of each of Flasks A, B, and C is topped with a 15/25 three-way stop cock connected to an argon/vacuum line. The main neck and the other side neck of each of Flasks A, B, and C are then fitted with 29/32 and 15/25 rubber septa, respectively. All joints are sealed with grease and Teflon tape. Flasks A, B, and C are dried under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) by heating with a heat gun for 5 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and backfilled with argon. After the 29/32 septum is removed from the main neck of Flask A, potassium tert-butoxide (11.3 g, 0.101 mol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 17) is added to Flask A through the main neck. After the 29/32 septum is removed from the main neck of Flask C, compound 2 (10.0 g, 50.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added to Flask C through the main neck. Then, the removed 29/32 rubber septa are reattached to the main necks of Flasks A and C and sealed with Teflon tape. Flasks A, B, and C are evacuated under high vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 5 min and backfilled with argon three times. Argon/vacuum lines are removed from three-way stop cocks on Flasks A, B, and C, each of which is then connected to a pair of argon inlet and outlet, respectively (Figure 2). Throughout the reaction before the addition of 2 M aqueous HCl, the argon atmosphere is maintained under continuous argon flow.\nFigure 2. Anion fragmentation reaction setup of Flask A under continuous argon flow (photo provided by checkers)\n\nFlask B is charged with diethyl ether (Note 18) in two portions (60 mL + 50 mL) by a 60 mL plastic syringe through the 29/32 septum. Diisopropylamine (15.0 mL, 0.107 mol, 2.1 equiv) (Note 19) is then added to Flask B by a 24 mL plastic syringe through the same septum. The solution in Flask B is then cooled to -78 \u00b0C using a dry ice/methanol bath (Note 20). Stirring is initiated and maintained at 500 rpm for 30 min after which time n-butyllithium (37.2 mL, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) (Note 21) is added dropwise over 5 min by a 60 mL plastic syringe through the 29/32 rubber septum. After the reaction mixture is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at -78 \u00b0C, the bath is changed to a 0 \u00b0C ice/water bath (Note 6) (Figure 3A). After the reaction mixture is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at 0 \u00b0C, the bath is changed to the -78 \u00b0C dry ice/methanol bath. The reaction mixture is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at -78 \u00b0C. Flask A containing potassium tert-butoxide is charged with diethyl ether in two portions (60 mL + 50 mL) by a 60 mL plastic syringe through the 29/32 septum. The stirred solution in Flask A (500 rpm) is cooled to -78 \u00b0C using a dry ice/methanol bath for 30 min (Note 22). Then, the reaction mixture in Flask B is slowly added to Flask A at -78 \u00b0C via a 50-cm, 10-gauge cannula through the 15/25 rubber septa (ca. 25 mL/min) (Figure 3B). After the cannula is removed, the reaction vessel (Flask A) is kept at -78 \u00b0C and stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h (Figure 3C).\nDuring this hour, Flask C containing compound 2 is charged with diethyl ether in two portions (60 mL + 50 mL) by a 60 mL plastic syringe through the 29/32 septum. The stirred solution in Flask C (500 rpm) is cooled to -78 \u00b0C using a dry ice/methanol bath for 30 min (Note 20). The reaction mixture in Flask C is then slowly transferred (ca. 22 mL/min) into the solution of LDA/t-BuOK (LIDAKOR) in Flask A at -78 \u00b0C via a 50-cm, 10-gauge cannula through the 15/25 rubber septa. (During the transfer, the color of the solution in Flask A gradually changes from pale yellow to orange (Figure 3D). The cannula is removed, and then the reaction mixture in Flask A is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at -78 \u00b0C, after which the color turns dark red (Note 23) (Figure 3E). Flask A is then removed from the -78 \u00b0C bath and allowed to warm for 30 min at room temperature.\nFigure 3.

Then, 2 M aqueous HCl (200 mL) (Note 24) is dispensed from a 500 mL graduated cylinder and added to the reaction mixture through a 100 mL plastic funnel topped on the main neck at room temperature (Figure 3F). After the removal of the plastic funnel from the main neck, the resultant biphasic mixture is stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min, during which the color changes from red to orange and finally to a vibrant yellow (Note 25) (Figure 3G). The stir bar is removed, and the resulting reaction mixture is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel. After the biphasic mixture is separated, the acidic aqueous layer is collected in a 1 L, 45/50 Erlenmeyer flask, and the organic layer is then washed again with 2 M aqueous HCl (200 mL) by shaking vigorously until venting results in no further gas evolution. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layers are combined. After the organic layer is collected in a separate 1 L, 45/50 Erlenmeyer flask, the combined aqueous layers are returned to the separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 50 mL). All organic layers are combined, returned to the separatory funnel, and washed with saturated brine (200 mL) (Note 10) before drying with Na2SO4 (100 g) (Note 11). After 10 min at room temperature, the drying agent is removed using a 350 mL plastic funnel plugged with cotton, and the filtrate is transferred to a 2 L, 29/32 round-bottomed flask. The flask is placed on the rotary evaporator (Note 12) and the solvent is removed (580 mmHg to 20 mmHg, 80 rpm, water bath temperature 38 \u00b0C) to give 3 as a dark brown oil (10.5 g crude) (Figure 3H).\nThe crude product 3 is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluents (Notes 13 and 26).

A 325 mL heavy-walled pressure vessel (Note 2), equipped with a Teflon-coated, football-shaped magnetic stir bar (24 mm \u00d7 10 mm), is charged with cyclopentanone (1.68 g, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 3), 4'-bromoacetophenone (5.18 g, 26.0 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 4), palladium(II) acetate (45 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1 mol%) (Note 5), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (122 mg, 0.40 mmol, 2 mol%) (Note 6), sodium acetate (1.64 g, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 7), pyrrolidine (0.50 mL, 6.0 mmol, 30 mol%) (Note 8), 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylamine (0.96 mL, 6.0 mmol, 30 mol%) (Note 9), and 100 mL of 1,4-dioxane (Note 10) under air. Pyrrolidine and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylamine are added using a 1 mL disposable syringe, and 1,4-dioxane is added using a 64 mL disposable syringe. The atmosphere in the vessel is replaced by flowing argon into the vessel at a flow rate of 7000 mL/min for 30 sec (Figure 1A). Argon gas (260 mL/min) is then bubbled through the solution with a syringe needle for 20 min (Figure 1B). The vessel is immediately capped with a Teflon bushing and sealed with Teflon tape (Note 11) (Figure 1C).\nFigure 1. Reaction set-up; (A) Blowing the vessel with argon gas; (B) Bubbling the solution with argon gas; (C) After inserting the vessel into an oil bath (photos provided by checkers)\n\nA blast shield is placed in front of the closed vessel. The reaction mixture is stirred (900 rpm) at 130 \u00b0C which is the temperature of an oil bath. The color of the solution changes from yellow (Figure 2A) to red after 15 min (Figure 2B), then to dark brown after 24 h (Figure 2C). After being stirred for 24 h at 130 \u00b0C, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the completion of the reaction is checked by TLC (Note 12). The mixture is filtered through a short pad of silica gel (inner diameter = 10 cm, height of silica gel = 1 cm) (Note 13) and eluted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL) into 1 L round-bottomed flask (Note 14) (Figure 3A, 3B). The resulting solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (20 mmHg, 37 \u00b0C) to afford the crude product as a dark red oil (6.39 g) (Figure 3C).\nFigure 2. Color change of the reaction mixture over the course of the reaction; (A) Before heating; (B) After 15 minutes; (C) After 24 hours (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe crude oil is dissolved in dichloromethane (Note 15) and loaded on a flash column chromatography on silica gel (125 g, 5 cm column diameter) (Notes 13 and 16) using ethyl acetate (Note 14) and hexane (Note 17) as eluents. The desired product is obtained in fractions 12-16 (Note 16), which are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (30 mmHg, 37 \u00b0C) to afford a yellow solid. The solid is then placed under a high vacuum (2 mmHg, 24 \u00b0C) for 70 min to afford 2.73 g (13.4 mmol, 67.0%) of 2-(4-acetylphenyl)cyclopentan-1-one (4) as a yellow solid (Notes 18, 19, and 20) (Figure 3D).\nFigure 3.

In air, an oven-dried 500 mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) equipped with a 3 x 1.5 cm Teflon-coated egg-shaped stir bar is charged with O-benzyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride (9.98 g, 62.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2), CH2Cl2 (170 mL) (Note 3), and de-ionized water (50 mL). To the suspension, potassium carbonate (17.29 g, 125 mmol, 2.0 equiv) Note 4) is added in one portion, and the mixture is stirred in the open air. The flask is immersed in an ice/water bath and stirred for 15 min at 0 \u00b0C (Note 5). An oven-dried 125 mL addition funnel (24/40 joint) is attached to the flask and charged with p-trifluoromethyl benzoyl chloride (9.30 mL, 62.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 6). The addition funnel is stoppered with a septum. The addition funnel is purged with argon by connecting to an argon manifold with a needle (18 G), and via another needle (18 G) to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler. The neat p-trifluoromethyl benzoyl chloride is added dropwise over 10 min while stirring at 0 \u00b0C, and the atmosphere is maintained under a slightly positive pressure of argon for the duration of the addition (Figure 1A). A white precipitate rapidly appears. The addition funnel is rinsed with CH2Cl2 (3 x 10 mL), and each rinse is added to the reaction flask. Once the addition is complete, the addition funnel is removed. The flask is closed with a septum equipped with a needle to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler, and the reaction is removed from the ice bath (Figure 1B). The reaction is stirred for five h at room temperature (Notes 7 and 8). The CH2Cl2 is removed by rotary evaporation (Notes 9 and 10) and diethyl ether (100 mL) is added (Note 11) to the resulting water suspension. The mixture is vacuum-filtered using a 250 mL (7.0 cm diameter) B\u00fcchner funnel lined with two filter paper circles moistened with deionized water; the funnel is attached to a 250 mL side-arm filter flask using a rubber filter adaptor. The white solids in the funnel are washed with diethyl ether (50 mL), followed by de-ionized water (2 x 50 mL), each time breaking the solids in the filter with a spatula and mixing thoroughly before applying the vacuum. The filter cake is washed with additional diethyl ether (50 mL) to afford a white solid (Figure 1C). The solids are transferred to a tared 125 mL round-bottomed flask using a spatula. The product is dried under vacuum (Note 12) at 70 \u00b0C overnight to yield 1 as a white powder (Figure 1D) in 89% yield (16.4 g, 55.4 mmol) (Notes 13, 14, and 15).\nFigure 1.

The flask is immersed in an ice-bath and stirred for 5 min at 0 \u00b0C (Note 16) to form a white suspension. The flask is wrapped in aluminum foil (Note 17) and re-submersed in the ice-bath. Trichloroisocyanuric acid (1.97 g, 8.47 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 18) is added to the flask portion-wise over 15 min (Note 19) while stirring at 0 \u00b0C. Once the addition is complete, the flask is stoppered with a septum equipped with a needle (18G) to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler, and the reaction is stirred for 1.5 h at 0 \u00b0C (Notes 20 and 21) (Figure 2A). The CH2Cl2 is removed by rotary evaporation (Notes 9 and 22) to yield the crude product as a yellow solid. Pentane (50 mL) (Note 23) and a 3 x 1.5 cm Teflon-coated egg-shaped stir bar are added to the flask. The contents are stirred for 2 min at room temperature (Note 7) to form an even mixture of a yellow solution with white suspended solids (Note 24). The mixture is vacuum filtered using a 60 mL fritted filter funnel (24/40 joint), packed with Celite\u00ae 3 cm in height (Note 25) attached to a 250 mL round-bottomed receiver flask (Figure 2B). The white solids (excess TCICA and byproducts) are collected in the fritted filter funnel, and the reaction flask is rinsed with additional pentane (2 x 40 mL), which is subsequently passed through the fritted filter funnel. pentane is removed from the receiver flask by rotary evaporation to dryness (Note 23). Product 2 is obtained as a pale, yellow solid (Notes 26 and 27) (Figure 2C), which is taken forward immediately to Step C (Note 28).\nFigure 2.

            "C. N-(Benzyloxy)-N-(pivaloxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (3). Anhydrous sodium pivalate is dried overnight in a vacuum oven (23 mmHg, 100 \u00b0C). In air, an oven-dried 200 mL pear-shaped Schlenk flask (24/40 joint; hose adaptor with PTFE stopcock) (Note 29) equipped with a 3 x 1.5 cm Teflon-coated egg-shaped stir bar is charged with the vacuum oven-dried sodium pivalate (3.15 g, 0.0254 mol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 30). The Schlenk flask is sealed with a rubber septum. The flask is attached to the Schlenk line via its hose adaptor and vacuum tubing (Note 31). The flask is evacuated and refilled with argon to obtain an inert atmosphere (Notes 32 and 33). The septum is pierced with a needle (18G) to connect to a gas outlet terminating in an oil bubbler. Dry, degassed acetonitrile (50 mL) (Note 34) is transferred to the Schlenk flask under an inert atmosphere using a 30 mL plastic syringe equipped with a needle (Note 35). The flask containing the white solids and acetonitrile is submersed in an ice-water bath and stirred vigorously (Note 5) for 30 min to form a white suspension equilibrated to 0 \u00b0C (Figure 3A). Acetonitrile (40 mL) (Note 34) is added to the 250 mL round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint) from Step B containing product 2 to form a yellow solution. The 250 mL round-bottomed flask and Schlenk flask are covered with aluminum foil (Note 36). The round-bottomed flask is sealed with a septum, which is pierced with a vent needle and an inlet needle attached to an argon line (Note 37) (Figure 3B). The solution is thoroughly sparged with argon gas for 15 min, and the vent needle is subsequently removed. Under a positive inert atmosphere, the degassed solution of 2 is added slowly to the cooled, vigorously stirred Schlenk flask over a period of 10 min via an oven-dried cannula (Note 38) to form a yellow solution with white suspended solids. The round-bottomed flask is rinsed with additional acetonitrile (2 x 5 mL) (the total volume of solvent is 100 mL, reaction concentration of 0.17 M), which is transferred to the Schlenk flask under a positive inert atmosphere using the cannula. The reaction is vigorously stirred (Note 5) at 0 \u00b0C under a positive flow of argon gas for 2 h (Note 39). In air, the white suspension is vacuum filtered through a plug of silica 2 cm in height (Notes 40 and 41) using a 60 mL fritted filter funnel with a 24/40 joint attached to a 500 mL round-bottomed flask (Figure 3C). White solids (sodium chloride) are collected in the frit, and the flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (100 mL) (Note 11), which is subsequently poured through the silica plug. The solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (Note 10). The residue is transferred from the 500 mL round-bottomed flask to a tared 100 mL round-bottomed flask, and the 500 mL flask is rinsed with additional diethyl ether (2 x 10 mL), which is transferred to the 100 mL flask. The solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (Note 10). The resulting oil is placed under high vacuum at room temperature (Note 7) for 2 h to yield 3 (Notes 42 and 43) as a clear oil (Figure 3D) in 93% yield (6.26 g, 15.8 mmol yield across two steps, calculated from amount of 1 used in Step B) (Note 44). Storage of 3 at 5 \u00b0C results in a waxy, off-white solid (Figure 3E) after 24 - 48 h (Note 45).\nFigure 3.

Reaction setup: A) After substrate addition; B) After acetic acid addition; C) After zinc addition (photos provided by submitters)\nAfter cooling to room temperature (23 \u00b0C), excess zinc dust is filtered off via gravitational filtration, into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask, using a glass funnel equipped with filter paper (Note 12) (Figure 7A) and the reaction flask is rinsed with aqueous acetic acid (1:1 v/v, 2 x 10 mL). Then, the volume of the filtrate is reduced by approximately two thirds by rotary evaporation (55 mmHg at 50 \u00b0C) (Figure 7B). Dichloromethane (150 mL) is added, and the mixture is carefully neutralized by addition of saturated NaHCO3 (ca. 70 mL) until pH 4 is reached (Note 34). The phases are separated through use of a separatory funnel, and a half-saturated sodium potassium tartrate solution (200 mL) (Note 35) is added to the organic layer (in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask). The biphasic mixture is stirred for 3 h at room temperature, during which time a precipitate forms. The phases are separated using a separatory funnel (whereby the precipitate is collected together with the dichloromethane phase), and the aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 100 mL) (Figure 7C) (Notes 17 and 36).\nFigure 7.

The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (450 mmHg at 40 \u00b0C and followed by 0.8 mmHg at 40 \u00b0C, followed by high vacuum (ca. 0.05 mmHg) at room temperature (23 \u00b0C) for 14 h), to afford product 4 as an-off white solid (5.46 g, 86%) (Figure 8) that requires no further purification (Note 37).\nFigure 8.

            "A. ((3-Methylfuran-2,5-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(tert-butyldimethylsilane) (1). A 1000 mL, three-necked (14/20, 29/42, 14/20), round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 16 \u00d7 38 mm, egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, two 14/20 glass stoppers, and a 29/42 glass gas adapter with a gas inlet (Figure 1A). The apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum and purged with inert gas in triplicate (Note 2). The setup is maintained under a slight positive pressure of inert gas and allowed to cool to ambient temperature (22 \u00b0C). The flask is charged with methylsuccinic anhydride (10.0 g, 87.6 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 3), and a glass stopper is replaced with a 14/20 rubber septum. Diethyl ether (350 mL, 0.25 M) (Note 4) is transferred into the flask via cannula (18 gauge), and vigorous stirring (700 rpm) is initiated. Once methylsuccinic anhydride is fully dissolved (ca. 5 min, colorless solution), the remaining glass stopper is replaced with a 14/20 Teflon thermometer adapter equipped with a glass thermometer (range of -20 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C) (Figure 1B). The reaction flask is submerged in an ice/water bath and cooled for 10 min to an internal temperature of 0 \u00b0C. Triethylamine (42.8 mL, 306.7 mmol, 3.5 equiv) (Note 5) is added to the flask in one portion using a 60 mL syringe. tert-Butyldimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (50.3 mL, 219.1 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 6) is added dropwise over 10 min using a 60 mL syringe, ensuring an internal temperature of 5 \u00b0C is not exceeded. Formation of a white cloudy precipitate and mild fuming is observed (Figure 1C). The precipitate dissolves during the course of the addition, and fumes dissipate shortly after addition is complete, resulting in a cloudy, colorless, biphasic mixture. The ice/water bath is removed, the reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and both the glass thermometer and septum are replaced with 14/20 glass stoppers (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1.

The crude mixture is filtered through a 600 mL, 10.5 cm diameter sintered funnel (medium grit) packed with 150 g of phosphate buffered silica (pH = 7, topped with filter paper) (Notes 9, 10, 11, and 12) eluting with diethyl ether (Note 13) until all product has eluted (determined by TLC) into a 1000 mL, single-necked (24/40), round-bottomed flask to remove the insoluble orange triflate salts (Figure 2C). The round-bottomed flask is placed on a rotary evaporator, and the solvent and triethylamine are removed (300-22 mmHg at 35 \u00b0C), providing the crude product as a yellow oil. The crude product is transferred to a 100 mL, single-necked (14/20), round-bottomed flask (Figure 2D) (Notes 14 and 15).\nFigure 2.

Chilled water circulation and stirring (500 rpm) are initiated, the setup is placed under vacuum (ca. 2.50 mmHg), and the distillation apparatus is insulated with glass wool and aluminum foil (Figure 3B). The crude mixture is warmed on a heating mantle at 80 \u00b0C to remove the majority of volatile impurities (Note 16). This process takes approximately 1 h, and several mL of distillate are collected. Once distillate collection in the receiving flask has ceased, the round-bottomed flask is cooled to ambient temperature and placed under a slight positive pressure of inert gas (Note 2). The distillation apparatus is replaced with a 14/20 glass gas adapter and the setup is re-exposed to vacuum. The round-bottomed flask is submerged in a water bath at 80 \u00b0C (Figure 3C). The flask is heated for several hours to remove the remaining traces of volatile impurities (Note 17), providing the crude product as a yellow oil. The crude residue is subjected to flash column chromatography with phosphate buffered silica (pH = 7) (Notes 18 and 19) to give ((3-methylfuran-2,5-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(tert-butyldimethylsilane) (1) (22.2 g, 74% yield, 97% purity) as a clear, colorless oil (Notes 20, 21, and 22) (Figure 3D).\nFigure 3.

A 500 mL, three-necked (24/40, 24/40, 24/40), round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 9.5 \u00b4 19 mm, egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, two 24/40 glass stoppers, and a 24/40 glass gas adapter with a gas inlet (Figure 4A). The apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum and purged with inert gas in triplicate (Note 2). The setup is maintained under a slight positive inert gas pressure and allowed to cool to ambient temperature (22 \u00b0C). The flask is charged with 2-iodophenol (15.0 g, 68.2 mmol, 1 equiv) (Note 23), and a glass stopper is replaced with a 24/40 rubber septum. Dichloromethane (134 mL, 0.5 M) (Note 24) is transferred into the flask via cannula (18 gauge), then stirring (500 rpm) is initiated, affording a transparent brown solution. The remaining glass stopper is replaced with a 24/40 Teflon thermometer adapter equipped with a glass thermometer (range of -20 \u00b0C to 250 \u00b0C) (Figure 4B). The reaction flask is submerged in an ice/water bath and cooled to 0 \u00b0C (internal reaction temperature). This process takes approximately 10 min. Pyridine (11.0 mL, 136.4 mmol, 2 equiv) (Note 25) is added in one portion using a 20 mL syringe, resulting in formation of a bright orange solution and an increase in internal reaction temperature to 6 \u00b0C) (Figure 4C). The reaction is allowed to cool to 0 \u00b0C, at which time trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (14.4 mL, 85.2 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 26) is added dropwise using a 20 mL syringe at a rate that ensures an internal reaction temperature of 10.0 \u00b0C is not exceeded. The addition process takes approximately 20 minutes, and formation of a fine, white precipitate accompanied by dense, white, cloudy fumes are observed. The ice/water bath is removed, and the reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature, during which time white fumes dissipate (Figure 4D).\nFigure 4. (A) Setup for procedure B; (B) Appearance of reaction after dichloromethane addition; (C) Appearance of reaction after pyridine addition; (D) Appearance of reaction 20 minutes after removal of ice/water bath (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe reaction is complete by the time the solution has warmed to ambient temperature (ca. 20 minutes after the removal of the ice/water bath). Completion of the reaction is confirmed by TLC (Note 27). The reaction mixture is diluted with deionized water (300 mL) and transferred to a 1000 mL separatory funnel, rinsing the reaction flask with dichloromethane (Note 28) and deionized water. The organic layer is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 \u00d7 100 mL). The organic layers are combined and washed with 2 M HCl (2 \u00d7 300 mL), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (1 \u00d7 300 mL), deionized water (1 \u00d7 300 mL), and brine (1 \u00d7 300 mL). The organic layer changes color from bright orange to orange-brown during the HCl wash, then returns to a bright orange color when washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer is dried over MgSO4 (13.0 g) and filtered through a 150 mL, 7.5 cm diameter sintered funnel (medium grit) into a 1000 mL, single-necked (24/40), round-bottomed flask. The flask is placed on a rotary evaporator, and the solvent is removed (180-22 mmHg at 25 \u00b0C), providing the crude product as a bright orange oil (Figure 5A). The crude residue is subjected to flash column chromatography on silica gel (Note 29) using hexanes and ethyl acetate (Notes 19 and 30) to give 2-iodophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2) (23.10 g, 96% yield, 99% purity) as a colorless oil (Notes 31 and 32) (Figure 5B).\nFigure 5.

A 500 mL, three-necked (24/40, 24/40, 24/40), round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 9.5 \u00d7 19 mm, egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, two 24/40 glass stoppers, and a 24/40 glass gas adapter with a gas inlet (Figure 6A). The apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum and purged with inert gas, a process that is performed in triplicate (Note 2). The setup is maintained under a slight positive inert gas pressure and allowed to cool to ambient temperature (22\u00b0C). A glass stopper is replaced with a 24/40 rubber septum, and the flask is charged with ((3-methylfuran-2,5-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(tert-butyldimethylsilane) via syringe transfer (1) (18.3 g, 19.6 mL, 53.3 mmol, 1.25 equiv) and 2-iodophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2) (15.0 g, 7.74 mL, 42.6 mmol, 1 equiv) via syringe transfer. Both 1 and 2 are degassed prior to addition through exposure to vacuum at room temperature for 5 min before transferring to a syringe under a positive pressure of inert gas. A positive pressure of inert gas is maintained throughout the syringe transfer. Tetrahydrofuran (171 mL, 0.25 M) (Note 33) is transferred into the flask via cannula (18 gauge), and the remaining glass stopper is exchanged for a 24/40 Teflon thermometer adapter equipped with an ultra-low temperature glass thermometer (range of -100 to 50 \u00b0C) (Figure 6B). Stirring is initiated (650 rpm), and the reaction flask is submerged in an acetone/dry ice bath and cooled to -70 \u00b0C (internal reaction temperature), a process requiring approximately 30 minutes. n-Butyllithium (1.23 M solution in hexanes, 43.3 mL, 53.3 mmol, 1.25 equiv) (Note 34) is added via syringe pump with a 60 mL syringe over 20 min (initial increase in internal reaction temperature to -58 \u00b0C). At the midpoint of the addition the reaction is a light pink color (Figure 6C). Following completion of n-butyllithium addition (internal reaction temperature of -64 \u00b0C), the reaction is maroon in color (Figure 6D).\nFigure 6. (A) Setup for procedure A; (B) Appearance of reaction after tetrahydrofuran addition; (C) Appearance of reaction midway through n-butyllithium addition; (D) Appearance of reaction immediately after n-butyllithium addition (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe reaction is stirred for a further 10 min then quenched by dropwise addition (ca. 1 min) of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (10 mL) via syringe. A small exotherm (-54 \u00b0C) and formation of a white precipitate are observed (Figure 7A). The reaction is allowed to warm to ambient temperature (ca. 1 h), at which point the reaction mixture is bright yellow with precipitate still present (Figure 7B). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 2000 mL separatory funnel, with subsequent rinsing of the reaction flask with ethyl acetate (100 mL) (Note 30) and deionized water (100 mL). The mixture is further diluted with 450 mL of deionized water to dissolve the precipitate, and the mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 \u00d7 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 2 M HCl (3 \u00d7 300 mL), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (1 \u00d7 300 mL), deionized water (1 \u00d7 300 mL), and brine (1 \u00d7 300 mL). The organic layer is dried over MgSO4 (24.6 g) and filtered through a 350 mL, 9.5 cm diameter sintered funnel (medium grit) into a 1000 mL, single-necked (24/40), round-bottomed flask. The flask is placed on a rotary evaporator and solvent is removed (75-22 mmHg at 25 \u00b0C) to afford a yellow solid (Figure 7C). The crude product is transferred to a 500 mL, single-necked (24/40), round-bottomed flask and residual solvent is removed under high vacuum (ca. 2.5 mmHg, ambient temperature for 3 h).\nFigure 7 (A) Appearance of reaction after ammonium chloride addition; (B) Appearance of reaction once warmed to ambient temperature; (C) Crude 2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione (3) (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 16 \u00d7 38 mm, egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. Hot hexanes (50 mL, 60 \u00b0C) (Note 19) are transferred into the flask, and stirring (400 rpm) of the mixture is initiated. The crude mixture is warmed to reflux (Figure 8A), and heating is maintained until the crude residue completely dissolves (ca. 5 min) (Note 35). The flask is equipped with a 24/40 plastic stopper (joint wrapped with Parafilm). The flask is removed from the heating mantle and allowed to cool to ambient temperature, by which time significant crystallization has occurred (Figure 8B). The flask is transferred to a freezer (-20 \u00b0C) for 12 h, then removed and immediately filtered through a 350 mL, 9.5 cm diameter sintered funnel (medium grit), eluting with a minimum volume of cold hexanes (ca. -20 \u00b0C) to give small, bright yellow crystals. The solid is transferred to a 50 mL beaker charged with a magnetic stir bar and stirred rigorously at room temperature for 5 min in hexanes (approximately 4 mL per gram of material). The crystals are collected by filtration through a 30 mL, 3.5 cm diameter sintered funnel (medium grit), eluting with a minimum volume of hexanes (ca. 20 mL). The resulting yellow solid is dried for 3 h under high vacuum (ca 2.5 mmHg, ambient temperature) to provide 2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione (3) (6.18 g, 84% yield, 98% purity) (Notes 36, 37, 38, and 39) (Figure 8C).\nFigure 8 (A) Appearance of crystallization midway through dissolution of crude residue; (B) Appearance of crystallization once cooled to ambient temperature; (C) Pure 2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione (3) (photos provided by submitters)"

Ammonium carbamate (10.9 g, 140 mmol, 4.0 equiv) (Note 6) is then added gradually to the suspension in roughly ten equal portions over a period of ten min allowing for controlled decarboxylation. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h, during which time the reaction mixture turns from colorless to yellow, and reaction progress is monitored by TLC (Figure 1a and b) (Note 7).\nFigure 1. a) Decarboxylation of ammonium carbamate; b) Reaction mixture after 1 h; c) Reaction mixture after removal of methanol (photos provided by submitters)\n\nThe organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure (25 \u00baC, 35 mmHg) to give a yellow slurry (Figure 1c), which is diluted with EtOAc (150 mL) (Note 8) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL). The mixture is stirred for 5 min to neutralize the acetic acid formed during the reaction. The resulting biphasic solution is transferred to a 1 L separatory funnel, rinsing the flask with EtOAc (50 mL) that is added to the separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the organic layer is washed with distilled H2O (100 mL) to remove residual ammonium carbamate. The organic layer is extracted with aqueous 1 M HCl (3 \u00d7 100 mL) (Figure 2a). The combined aqueous layers are back extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). These three extracts are combined and washed with distilled H2O (100 mL), after which the organic layer is extracted with HCl (1 M; 3 x 50 mL). Phases are separated and the separatory funnel is rinsed with EtOAc (2 \u00d7 100 mL), which is discarded. The combined acidic aqueous fractions are transferred back into the separatory funnel and washed with CH2Cl2 (2 \u00d7 100 mL) (Note 9), which is removed. The aqueous layer is then basified with aqueous NaOH (2 M; 200 mL). The basified aqueous layer is extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 \u00d7 100 mL).

Afterwards, 77% m-CPBA (4 \u00d7 1.75 g, 4 \u00d7 7.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 9) is added via a powder funnel to the reaction solution at 5-min intervals over an overall period of 20 min. The reaction between m-CPBA and K2CO3 produces gas and creates an exothem sufficient to cause DCM to condense on the walls of the flask. The reaction mixture is stirred at 520 rpm for 4 h at 25 \u2103 under air (Figure 2A). The stir bar is removed, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel (250 mL). The three-necked flask is further washed with DCM (3 \u00d7 5 mL) (Note 3), which is combined and transferred to the same separatory funnel. Water (100 mL) is added, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 50 mL) (Note 10). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (ca. 90 g) (Note 11) for 1 h. After filtration with a sand core funnel, the filtrate is then transferred to the pear-shaped flask (250 mL). The source flask is further washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 5 mL) (Note 10), which is combined and transferred to the flask. The flask is connected to a rotary evaporator, concentrated under reduced pressure (38 \u2103, 40 mmHg), and dried in vacuo (0.25 mmHg) at ambient temperature for 1 h to afford crude 3-chlorobenzoic 4-phenoxybenzoic peroxyanhydride 3 (10.9 g) (Figure 2B) (Notes 12, 13, and 14), which is used directly without further purification for the next step.\nFigure 2.

            "C. 4-Phenoxyphenol (4). An oven-dried three-necked flask (250.0 mL) is equipped with two glass stoppers, a two-way adapter connected to a vacuum/argon inlet, and a 2.4-cm \u00d7 1.0-cm Teflon-coated football-shaped stir bar. The three-necked flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon three times, and the flask is submerged in a water bath (23 \u2103). Under argon atmosphere, 3-chlorobenzoic 4-phenoxybenzoic peroxy-anhydride 3 (10.9 g, 29.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 13) is added via a powder funnel, following brief removal of one of the glass stoppers. The source flask is washed with anhydrous DCM (3 \u00d7 5.0 mL) (Note 15), and the solution is then transferred via a plastic syringe to the reaction flask. Then, anhydrous DCM (115.0 mL) (Note 15) is added to a three-necked flask by syringe. Triflic acid (CF3SO3H) (2.10 mL, 23.8 mmol, 0.8 equiv) (Note 16) is added to the reaction mixture using a glass, air-tight syringe with Luer lock metal needle (3 mL) at an addition rate of one drop every 5 sec for about 20 min. The reaction produces gas (possibly CO2) and an exotherm that causes DCM to condense on the walls of the flask. The solution turns from colorless to dark red.The reaction mixture is stirred at 520 rpm for 6 h at 25 \u2103 (Figure 3A). The resulting solution is distilled under reduced pressure (25 \u2103, 40 mmHg) with an aspirator-keeping the water bath in place, in order to counteract cooling of the reaction mixture during distillation-to provide the crude corresponding phenolic ester (Figure 3B) (Note 17). The three-necked flask (250 mL) containing phenolic esters is evacuated and back-filled with argon three times. Methanol (130.0 mL) (Note 18) is added by a 150.0 mL plastic syringe to the three-necked flask. Potassium carbonate (12.6 g, 91.5 mmol, 3.1 equiv) (Note 8) is then added via a powder funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred at 520 rpm for 18 h at 25 \u2103 (Figure 3C), and the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 19). The reaction mixture is acidified by addition of 1 M HCl to pH = 3-5, and the stir bar is removed. The resulting mixture is transferred to the pear-shaped flask (500 mL). The source flask is further washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 5 mL) (Note 10), which is combined and transferred to the flask. The flask is connected to a rotary evaporator, the methanol solution is concentrated under reduced pressure (38 \u2103, 40 mmHg) and the remaining solution is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel. The pear-shaped flask is further washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 20 mL) (Note 10), which is combined and transferred to the separation funnel. Water (40 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (40 mL) are added into the separation funnel, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 60 mL) (Note 10). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (ca. 85 g) (Note 11) for 1 h. After the filtration through a sand core funnel, the filtrate is then transferred to the pear-shaped flask (250 mL). The source flask is further washed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 5 mL) (Note 10), which is combined and transferred to the flask. The flask is connected to a rotary evaporator and is concentrated under reduced pressure (38 \u2103, 40 mmHg), The residue is purified by chromatography on silica gel (Note 20) (petroleum ether/EtOAc) to afford 4-phenoxyphenol (4.12 g, 67% yield for three steps) (Figure 3D) (Notes 21, 22, and 23).\nFigure 3.

            "Potassium 5-bromopentyltrifluoroborate (3). An oven-dried three-necked, 250 mL round-bottomed flask is fitted with a gas inlet and a thermocouple inserted through a rubber septum. The flask is equipped with a 2.25 cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, and the third neck fitted with a rubber septum. The flask is evacuated (<0.1 mmHg) and backfilled with nitrogen three times. The flask is charged with 5-bromo-1-pentene (4.8 mL, 40.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 2) and triethylsilane (6.9 mL, 42.9 mmol, 1.06 equiv) (Note 3), both via syringe. While stirring, the mixture is cooled to -78 \u2103 with a dry ice-acetone bath (Figure 1A), (Note 4) followed by the dropwise (3 mL/min) addition of a 1.0 M solution of boron trichloride in hexane (46 mL, 46 mmol, 1.1 equiv) (Notes 5 and 6) via glass syringe. The reaction is stirred at -78 \u2103 for 40 min, the dry ice-acetone bath is removed, and the reaction is stirred for an additional 2 h (Figure 1B). Prior to the aqueous quench, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0 \u2103 with an ice bath. The rubber septum is removed, and water (50 mL) is added in two equal portions over the course of five min to convert the dichloroborane to the corresponding boronic acid (Note 7). The ice bath is removed, and after stirring for 30 min the reaction mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel and extracted with ether (3 x 100 mL) (Note 4). The combined organics are washed with brine (100 mL) in a 500 mL separatory funnel, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (60 g), and filtered using a B\u00fcchner funnel (9.0 cm) with ether rinsing (20 mL) (Note 4). The organic solvent is transferred to a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (~1-2 mmHg) followed by a high vacuum pump (0.01 mmHg). A clear, colorless oily residue (disiloxane) with a white solid (boronic acid) is formed (Figure 2) (Note 8).\nFigure 1. (a) Reaction mixture after adding all reactants and (b) reaction mixture after removing the dry-ice acetone bath (photos provided by checker)\n\nFigure 2. Boronic acid (white solid) in disiloxane by-product (clear, colorless oil) (photo provided by submitter)\n\nTo the mixture of boronic acid and disiloxane byproduct, diethyl ether (100 mL) along with a 2.25 cm Teflon coated stir-bar is added, followed by potassium hydrogen difluoride (13.3 g, 169.8 mmol, 4.2 equiv) (Note 9). The flask's contents are stirred, and water (2 mL) is added via syringe in ~0.5 mL portions every 15 min (Figure 3). This mixture is stirred for an additional 1 h at 23-25 \u2103 (Note 10), after which time the mixture is filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel (9.0 cm) while rinsing the flask and the funnel with acetone (1 x 100 mL) (Note 4) to remove any byproduct salts. The filtrate is transferred to a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (~1-2 mmHg). The resulting solid is purified by dissolution in a minimum of acetone (ca. 10 mL) and precipitation via slow addition of this solution of the trifluoroborate salt into diethyl ether (500 mL) (Note 4). Precipitation occurs immediately. The precipitate is collected using a B\u00fcchner funnel (9.0 cm), and the solid is rinsed with diethyl ether (3 x 20 mL) (Note 4). The solid is dried for at least 1 h under high vacuum (0.01 mmHg) to provide 7.79 g (75%) of pure 3 (Notes 11, 12, and 13) (Figure 4).\nFigure 3.

A single-necked (24/40 joint) 100 mL glass reaction tube with glass stopcock side arm is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (3.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm, football-shaped) (Note 2) (Figure 1A). The reaction tube is charged with 4'-bromoacetophenone (3.98 g, 20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 3), cesium carbonate (9.77 g, 30 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 4), and 2-chlorobenzenethiol (4.34 g, 30 mmol, 1.5 equiv) (Note 5), each in one portion. The tube is sealed with a 24/40 rubber septum and the tube is then placed under high vacuum (<1 mmHg) for 1 min and backfilled with nitrogen through the side glass stopcock three times. Dry dimethyl sulfoxide (50 mL) (Note 6) is added to the tube by a plastic syringe and needle through the rubber septum to give a yellow suspension (Note 7) (Figure 1B). The rubber septum is then sealed with electrical tape, the stopcock is closed, and the reaction tube is irradiated at 456 nm with one 40 W Kessil Lamp PR160 at a distance of 5 cm with stirring at 800 rpm. A fan is used to maintain the reaction tube at 23 \u2103 (Figure 1 C).\nFigure 1. A) Reaction tube with stir bar; B) Reaction tube with stir bar and reagents; C) Reaction tube is irradiated at 456 nm with one 40 W Kessil Lamp PR160 lamps and a fan (photos provided by submitters)\n\nAfter 5 h (Note 8), the tube is opened to the air, and the contents of the reaction vessel are transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel. Water (10 mL) and 10 mL of EtOAc (10 mL) (Note 9) are used to rinse the reaction vessel to ensure a quantitative transfer. To the separatory funnel is then added 50 mL of water. The aqueous layer is then extracted EtOAc (3 \u00d7 75 mL). The pooled organic layers are washed with brine (20 mL), and then dried over 7 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Note 10) for 10 min. After drying, the organic layer is filtered through a medium porosity fritted funnel, the magnesium sulfate rinsed with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 10 mL), and the organic layer concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 \u2103, 225 to 60 mmHg) to give the crude material, which solidifies as a tan solid.\nFigure 2. A) Reaction mixture after 5 h at room temperature; B) Separated organic and aqueous layers during first extraction; C) Separated organic and aqueous layers during brine wash (photos provided by checkers)\n\nThe tan solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (3 mL) (Note 11) and submitted to flash column chromatography using a 5 cm diameter column with a length of 20 cm of silica gel (90 g) (Note 12). This column is compacted using silica gel with petroleum ether (200 mL) (Note 13), and the surface levelled. The crude material is transferred onto the compacted column with a pipette. The flask is rinsed twice with dichloromethane (1 mL) and the washings are added to the column. Once adsorbed, cotton is added to protect the silica.\nFigure 3. Purification by column chromatography (photo provided by submitter)\n\nThe column is eluted with 1.5 L of a 5:1 petroleum ether:ethyl acetate solution. The tubes containing pure samples are collected (Note 14) in a 1 L round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 \u2103, 225 to 30 mmHg) to afford 1-(4-((2-Chlorophenyl)thio)phenyl)ethan-1-one (3) as a white solid. The resulting solid is kept under high vacuum at room temperature for 4 h to afford pure product 3 (4.34 g, 83% yield) (Notes 15, 16 and 17) with 98% purity determined by qNMR analysis (Note 18)."
