            "The apparatus is assembled according to Fig. 1. B and D are 5-l. round-bottomed flasks, immersed to about two-thirds of their height in deep oil baths heated by large burners. Each bath is provided with a thermometer reaching to the level of the bottom of the flask. Flask B is fitted with a specially treated two-holed cork stopper (Note 1), in one hole of which is fitted a 500-cc. separatory funnel A and in the other a delivery tube C of 12-mm. diameter. The tubes must not extend more than 3 mm. below the stopper. Flask D is fitted with a three-holed cork stopper connected with a separatory funnel, the delivery tube from B, and the delivery tube E of 12-mm. tubing leading to flask F. F is a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask immersed to two-thirds of its height in an oil bath heated by a Bunsen burner and provided with a thermometer.\nFig. 1.\nFlask F is provided with a two-holed cork stopper connected with tube E, and with tube G which connects with the first condenser H and may be of smaller bore than tubes C and E. H is a condenser with a 30-cm. water jacket. H is connected with I by means of an adapter. I is a 1-l. round-bottomed flask supported in a pan which is at first filled with ice and later used as a water bath. Flask I is fitted with a two-holed cork stopper carrying the adapter connected with condenser H and a Vigreux column K of 2-cm. diameter and a length of 30 cm. to the side arm. Flask I and condenser H are covered with black cloth (Note 2). The side arm of K is connected with a 90-cm. water-jacketed condenser L which leads into M through an adapter. M is a 750-cc. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath. Flask M is provided with a two-holed stopper connected with the adapter from L and an upright bulb condenser that is provided with a tube leading through a window or to a hood.\nBefore the final assembling of the apparatus, the flasks are charged as follows: One kilo of freshly fused and finely powdered acid potassium sulfate, 200 g. of powdered potassium sulfate, and 300 g. (238 cc.) of dry glycerol (Note 3) are thoroughly mixed in each of flasks B and D. In each of flasks I and M is placed about 1 g. of hydroquinone to act as a stabilizer for the acrolein.1\nThe apparatus is assembled as indicated and the oil baths under B and D are heated to about 190\u2013200\u00b0 (Note 4), and the oil bath under F to about 110\u2013120\u00b0. The bath under I is filled with ice. The volatile products are collected in I which is kept carefully protected from light. When the reaction is well started 300 g. of dry glycerol is placed in each separatory funnel, and added drop by drop during the heating. After the first violent reaction has abated (about one hour) the baths under B and D are raised to 215\u2013230\u00b0 and maintained there until no more volatile product comes over (a total time of heating of about four and one-half hours). After B and D have been heated about four hours the ice under I is replaced by water which is heated to 75\u201380\u00b0 to distil the acrolein into flask M, which is packed in ice. Near the end of the distillation the water under I is heated to boiling.\nThe product in M is treated with small amounts of solid sodium bicarbonate to neutralize any acid present. The cold liquid is filtered through a small filter into a 1500-cc. distilling flask containing about 1 g. of hydroquinone. It is then distilled into a tared dark bottle containing about 1 g. of hydroquinone. The yield of product boiling at 52.5\u201355.5\u00b0 (Note 5) obtained from 1200 g. (13 moles) of dry glycerol is 240\u2013350 g. (33\u201348 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

(16.4 moles) (Note 1) of crystalline copper sulfate (Note 2), 4000 g. of technical pyridine and 1600 g. of water. This is heated on a steam bath with stirring until the copper sulfate is completely dissolved and then 1696 g. (8 moles) of benzoin (p. 94; unrecrystallized material is satisfactory) is added and heating and stirring continued for two hours. The reaction mixture becomes dark green in color and the melted benzil forms the upper layer. After cooling, the copper sulfate-pyridine solution is decanted and the benzil washed with water and then heated with 3\u20134 l. of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid. After cooling, the benzil is filtered, washed with water, dried and recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride (2 l. of solvent per kg. of benzil). By concentration of the mother liquors a certain amount of benzil is always obtained. The total yield is 1450 g. (86 per cent of the theoretical amount) of recrystallized material melting at 94\u201395\u00b0 (Note 3).\nThe copper sulfate-pyridine mixture is readily reoxidized by passing a current of air through it for thirty-six hours (Note 4). To this resulting solution is now added 200 g. of pyridine and it is then used for oxidizing another 1696 g. portion of benzoin."

            "p-Acetotoluide is prepared by refluxing 214 g. (2 moles) of commercial p-toluidine with 800 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask for two hours. The reflux condenser is replaced by a mechanical stirrer and the mixture is stirred and cooled to 45\u00b0. Part of the product may separate in small crystalline flakes. The mixture is thoroughly stirred and 325 g. (102 cc., 2.03 moles) of bromine is added slowly from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 50\u201355\u00b0. During the course of this addition, which requires about forty minutes, a precipitate may separate; this later dissolves. The mixture is stirred one-half hour after the bromine has been added, and is then poured in a thin stream (Note 1) with efficient stirring into 10 l. of cold water to which has been added 25 g. of sodium bisulfite (Note 2).\nThe 3-bromo-4-acetaminotoluene separates in crystalline flocks. It is filtered by suction and washed well with water and pressed dry. The wet crude material is dried until its weight does not exceed 500 g. before proceeding with the hydrolysis (Note 3).\nThe partially dried 3-bromo-4-acetaminotoluene is refluxed with 500 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. To the boiling solution is added 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and the refluxing is continued for three hours. During this time, crystals of the hydrochloride of 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene separate. The hot mixture is poured into a 2-l. beaker and cooled thoroughly in running water. The hydrochloride is filtered by suction and washed rapidly with two 100-cc. portions of chilled alcohol. The weight of the hydrochloride is 250\u2013300 g. (Note 4).\nThe hydrochloride is suspended in 800 cc. of water in a 2-l. beaker provided with a mechanical stirrer. The base is liberated by the addition of a solution of 140 g. of technical sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water, and settles as a heavy brownish oil. After cooling to room temperature, the oil is separated and weighed. The yield of the crude base is 225\u2013250 g. (60\u201367 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the amount of p-toluidine used). The crude material may be used directly for the preparation of m-bromotoluene (p. 133).\nThe base may be purified by steam distillation but distillation under reduced pressure is more satisfactory. The oil is dried over 5 g. of solid sodium hydroxide and distilled under reduced pressure. The first portion of the distillate may contain p-toluidine and must be carefully separated, as it causes rapid discoloration. The 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene is obtained as a colorless liquid of b.p. 120\u2013122\u00b0/30 mm. or 92\u201394\u00b0/3 mm. It solidifies on cooling and melts at 16\u201318\u00b0. The loss on purification is about 15 per cent of the weight of the crude base."

Ethylene oxide (Note 2) is led into the acid solution as indicated in Fig. 8. The tank E is arranged on a balance so that the amount of ethylene oxide which is used can be weighed. B is a U-tube containing water to indicate the rate of flow of the gas. D is a glass coil surrounded by ice and salt which cools the gas nearly to the liquefaction temperature. C is another U-tube containing water which shows whether or not the gas is being completely absorbed.\nFig. 8.\nThe flask A is surrounded by an ice-salt bath and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the acid has dropped to 10\u00b0, 132 g. (3 moles) of ethylene oxide is added over a period of about two and one-half hours (Note 3). The stirring is continued for one hour (Note 4) after all of the ethylene oxide has been added and the temperature is maintained below 10\u00b0 during the reaction.\nAfter this time the excess hydrobromic acid is neutralized with excess sodium carbonate, of which about 100 g. of anhydrous salt is required. To the aqueous solution is then added about 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate until some of the solid does not dissolve. A layer of ethylene bromohydrin separates and is collected in 200 cc. of ether. The ether layer is below the aqueous layer. The solid sodium sulfate is filtered from the solution and washed once or twice with a small amount of ether (Note 5) to remove any mechanically held bromohydrin. The aqueous filtrate is twice extracted with 200-cc. portions of ether (Note 6). The combined ether extracts are dried overnight with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and distilled from a steam bath (Note 7). The remaining bromohydrin is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 8). After two distillations the fraction boiling at 55\u201359\u00b0/22 mm. (Note 9) is pure ethylene bromohydrin. The yield is 327\u2013345 g. (87\u201392 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

After all of the nitrite solution has been added, the mixture is stirred twenty minutes longer to complete the diazotization.\nTo the diazotized solution is added 35 g. (0.55 atom) of copper bronze (Note 2) which has been washed with ether. The stirrer is replaced by a long, efficient reflux condenser. A bath of ice water is prepared for cooling the flask when the reaction becomes too vigorous. The flask is warmed cautiously until a vigorous evolution of gas starts. It is then immersed in the ice water to prevent loss through the condenser by too rapid evolution of nitrogen and acetaldehyde. When the reaction has moderated, the flask is again warmed, and finally the mixture is heated for ten minutes on a steam bath. At the end of the reaction the color changes from reddish brown to yellow.\nAfter the addition of 2 l. of water, the mixture is steam-distilled as long as any oil comes over.

(1.1 atoms) of magnesium turnings. The reaction requires 450 cc. of ether and 118.5 g. (121 cc., 1 mole) of cyclohexyl chloride (Note 1). About 100 cc. of the ether, 15 cc. of the pure halide, and a crystal of iodine are added to the magnesium. Heat is applied, without stirring, for five to ten minutes after the iodine color has disappeared. When reaction has set in, sufficient ether is added to cover the magnesium while it is stirred, and the remainder of the halide in ether is added in one-half to three-quarters of an hour, the flask being cooled with ice water if necessary. When all the halide has been added, stirring and refluxing are continued fifteen to twenty minutes.\nThe separatory funnel is now replaced by a wide glass tube (about 12 mm. internal diameter) which reaches almost to, but not below, the surface of the liquid (Note 2). This tube connects directly with a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask containing 50 g. of paraformaldehyde which has been previously dried for two days in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. This flask contains an inlet tube for admitting dry nitrogen. The stirrer is started (Note 3), and the flask containing the paraformaldehyde is heated in an oil bath to 180\u2013200\u00b0. The formaldehyde formed by depolymerization (Note 4) and (Note 5) is carried over into the Grignard reagent by a slow current of dry nitrogen. At the end of about one and three-quarters hours the reaction is complete, as is indicated by a negative color test for Grignard reagent (Note 6).\nThe reaction mixture is then transferred to a 2-l. wide-necked, round-bottomed flask; 300 g. of cracked ice is added all at once; and the mixture is rapidly agitated until the decomposition is complete (Note 7). Twice the theoretical amount of 30 per cent sulfuric acid is added to dissolve the magnesium hydroxide, and the mixture is then steam-distilled until no more oil is collected (Note 8). The distillate, which amounts to 1500\u20132500 cc., is saturated with sodium chloride and the ether-alcohol layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether and the ether extract added to the ether-alcohol layer. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and heated carefully on a steam cone until all the ether is distilled. The crude alcohol is warmed one-half hour with 5 g. of freshly dehydrated lime (Note 9). After filtering and washing the lime with a little ether, the ether is distilled, and then the residual alcohol distilled from a Claisen flask (Note 10) under reduced pressure. The carbinol distils at 88\u201393\u00b0/18 mm. (practically all distilling at 91\u00b0). The yield is 72.5\u201378.5 g. (64\u201369 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "A mixture of 120 g. (3.1 moles) of sodamide (Note 1) and 200 cc. of purified mineral oil (Note 2) is ground together in a mortar until the amide is finely pulverized (Note 3). This suspension is transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser holding a calcium chloride tube, a 500-cc. separatory funnel, and an efficient mechanical stirrer through a mercury seal. The mortar and pestle are rinsed with an additional 250 cc. of the oil which is then added to the reaction flask. This is heated in an oil bath maintained at 160\u2013165\u00b0, the stirrer is started, and 203 g. (1 mole) of cyclohexylbromopropene (p. 186) is dropped in during one and one-half hours. Ammonia is evolved, and this is allowed to pass through the condenser and is collected in water.\nAfter all the cyclohexylbromopropene has been run in, heating is continued for about two hours, the mixture is cooled and 500 cc. of ether is added. This mixture is poured on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice in a 5-l. flask and then acidified with 280 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ether layer is separated, dried over calcium chloride, and transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) for distillation. The ether is distilled at ordinary pressure and then the cyclohexylpropine under diminished pressure. The product boiling up to 115\u00b0/20 mm. is collected and fractionated. The cyclohexylpropine boils at 58\u201363\u00b0/20 mm. The higher-boiling material is chiefly unchanged cyclohexylbromopropene which may be used again in a subsequent run. The yield of cyclohexylpropine is 80 g. (66 per cent of the theoretical amount not taking into consideration the recovered cyclohexylbromopropene which amounts to about 10 g.) (Note 4).

            "A mixture of 200 g. (2 moles) of mesityl oxide (p. 345) and 280 cc. of aqueous ammonia (27 per cent) is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The stirrer should be inserted through a stopper in such a way that the flask is nearly air-tight. Because of the heat generated during the reaction it is desirable to keep tap water running over the flask. After stirring for several hours (Note 1) the system becomes homogeneous. When this point is reached the stirring is discontinued, and the well-stoppered flask is allowed to stand at room temperature for three days (Note 2).\nDry air is blown through the solution to remove the excess of ammonia, and the solution is then dissolved in its own volume of absolute alcohol. A sample of this solution is titrated with standard oxalic acid, litmus being used as an outside indicator (Note 3). The amount of oxalic acid (Note 4) necessary to form the acid salt is placed in a large evaporating dish and dissolved in 4 l. of 95 per cent alcohol. The amine solution is then slowly run into the acid with constant stirring. During the addition of the last half of the amine solution, the container must be cooled in order to avoid the formation of the neutral oxalate.\nThe resulting mixture is then heated on a steam cone or an air bath with constant stirring until the temperature of the mixture reaches 70\u00b0. The mixture is filtered, while hot, through a previously heated B\u00fcchner funnel. The filtrate is immediately placed in a large beaker or evaporating dish for the crystallization of the diacetonamine hydrogen oxalate (Note 5). The residue is treated with boiling alcohol and filtered, the filtrate containing a small additional quantity of the amine hydrogen oxalate. The mother liquor is distilled until nothing further passes over at 78\u00b0 (Note 6), and the residue is allowed to stand for a day in a cool place. The crystals that separate are washed with cold absolute alcohol and dried. A total yield of 285\u2013320 g. (63\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) of product that melts at 126\u2013127\u00b0 is obtained (Note 7)."

A mixture of 30 g. of bromobenzene and 70 cc. of dry ether is run in and the flask warmed gently until the reaction becomes rapid. Stirring is then started, and the vessel is surrounded by a dish of cold water. A mixture of 151 g. of bromobenzene (total: 181 g., 1.15 moles) and 380 cc. of dry ether is run in at such a rate as to cause vigorous refluxing; when the addition is complete (one hour) the whole is stirred for ten minutes.\nAfter the flask has been cooled by immersion in ice water, 44 g. (0.5 mole) of dry ethyl acetate (Note 1) in an equal volume of ether is added over a period of twelve minutes. The cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for ten minutes. When the reaction flask has again been cooled by the ice-water bath, a previously prepared ammonium chloride solution (Note 2) is added, very slowly at first, over a period of ten minutes, during which a pasty solid separates.\nThe ether layer is decanted into a separatory funnel, and to it is added a 50-cc. ether extract of the pasty residue. The ether is removed by dropping the solution into a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask attached to a condenser and immersed in an oil bath heated to 210\u2013215\u00b0. The flask is removed from the oil bath, cooled, and disconnected from the condenser; 100 cc. of 20 per cent sulfuric acid is added. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the contents are boiled for one hour. The aqueous layer is now removed, and the residual oil, without being washed, is distilled at a pressure of about 30 mm. and a bath temperature of about 210\u00b0 (Note 3). At first a low-boiling fraction consisting of bromobenzene (12\u201314 g.) and traces of water distils, after which the diphenylethylene comes over as a colorless liquid, the last portions being slightly yellowish.

Toward the end the mixture becomes so thick that stirring is difficult. Stirring is continued for one hour after the addition of the oxalate and acetone mixture.

            "One kilogram (862 cc., 10.2 moles) of furfural (Note 1) is placed in a 4-l. copper can (Note 2) provided with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The stirrer is started and the furfural is cooled to 5\u20138\u00b0. When the temperature has fallen to this range, 825 g. of 33.3 per cent technical sodium hydroxide solution (Note 3) is added from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 20\u00b0. This requires twenty to twenty-five minutes. The rate of addition will depend on the efficiency of the cooling. The stirring is continued for one hour after the addition of the sodium hydroxide solution.\nDuring the reaction considerable sodium 2-furancarboxylate separates in fine scale-like crystals. The reaction mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and just enough water is added to dissolve this precipitate. This requires about 325 cc. The solution is then placed in a continuous extraction apparatus (Fig. 16) and the 2-furylcarbinol is extracted with 1500\u20132000 cc. of ether (Note 4). The extraction is complete after six to seven hours (Note 5).\nFig. 16.\nWhen extraction is complete the ether solution of 2-furylcarbinol is distilled until the temperature of the liquid (not the vapor) reaches 95\u00b0. Then the residue is distilled under diminished pressure. Some ether and water come over first, and the temperature then rises rapidly to the boiling point of 2-furylcarbinol. The yield of 2-furylcarbinol boiling at 75\u201377\u00b0/15 mm. is 310\u2013325 g. (61\u201363 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6).\nThe water solution containing the sodium 2-furancarboxylate is made acid to Congo red paper with 40 per cent sulfuric acid. This requires about 400 cc. On cooling, the 2-furancarboxylic acid crystallizes and is filtered with suction. The crude acid contains considerable sodium hydrogen sulfate and is deeply colored. For purification it is dissolved in 2300 cc. of boiling water containing about 60 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite) and the solution is boiled for about forty-five minutes. It is then filtered and cooled with stirring to 16\u201320\u00b0 (Note 7) and the 2-furancarboxylic acid which crystallizes is filtered by suction. The product thus obtained is light yellow in color but darkens somewhat on standing. The yield is 360\u2013380 g. (60\u201363 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8). This acid melts at 121\u2013124\u00b0 and by titration is 93\u201395 per cent pure. It is pure enough for many purposes.\nFor further purification the material may be recrystallized from hot water, or dissolved in alkali and reprecipitated, or distilled under reduced pressure or sublimed. Each of these operations involves considerable loss of product, either through solubility or through decomposition by heat. The best-appearing product is obtained by distillation under reduced pressure. The crude acid is distilled from a Claisen flask with a delivery tube set low in order that the acid need not be heated much above the boiling point. The product boiling at 141\u2013144\u00b0/20 mm. is pure white and melts at 125\u2013132\u00b0 (Note 9). The yield of distilled acid is about 75\u201385 per cent of the weight of the crude acid."

            "To 500 cc. of absolute alcohol (Note 1) in a 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser is added gradually 46 g. (2 atoms) of sodium in thin slices (Note 2) at such a rate that the mixture boils steadily. When all the sodium has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam bath until the few remaining pieces of sodium barely react. Pure commercial molten phenol is now added gradually through the condenser until all the sodium has reacted, and then the remainder of 188 g. (2 moles) of phenol is added. This is followed by the addition of 221 g. (2 moles) of redistilled glycerol \u03b1-monochlorohydrin (p. 294) in small portions, the rather vigorous reaction being allowed to complete itself before each subsequent addition.\nWhen all has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam bath for about one hour. The end of the reaction is determined by withdrawing a sample, filtering it, and heating the filtrate in which little or no precipitate should form. The mixture is filtered hot by suction through filter cloth or heavy filter paper (Note 3), the precipitate being washed with three 50-cc. portions of absolute alcohol. The filtrate and washings are distilled on the steam bath under slightly reduced pressure until no more alcohol comes over; the residue, which sets to a white waxy solid on cooling, is transferred to a distilling flask and distilled under reduced pressure, the fraction boiling at 175\u2013190\u00b0/15 mm. being collected. In this way 235\u2013275 g. of a product melting at 43\u201349\u00b0 is obtained. On redistillation, 205\u2013215 g. (61\u201364 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a fraction which boils at 185\u2013187\u00b0/15 mm. and melts at 48\u201353\u00b0 is obtained (Note 4)."

The flask is then fitted to an apparatus for steam distillation (p. 479) and the mixture distilled in a current of steam (Note 4) until no more oil passes over (7\u20138 l. of distillate). The oil is then separated, and the aqueous part distilled to recover a small quantity of dissolved or suspended heptyl alcohol.\nThe combined product is mixed with 1 l. of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and stirred on the steam bath for four hours, in order to hydrolyze a small proportion of heptyl acetate. The oil is then separated and distilled, and the portion boiling at 172\u2013176\u00b0 is collected. The residue in the flask is mixed with about 100 cc. of water and distilled, whereupon a further small quantity of oil passes over with the steam. This distillate and the forerun are freed of the bulk of the water in a separatory funnel and distilled from a smaller flask.

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, separatory funnel, and a reflux condenser to the upper end of which a calcium chloride tube is attached, is placed 150 g. (6.2 atoms) of magnesium turnings. A small crystal of iodine (Note 1) and about 100 cc. of a mixture of 822 g. (6 moles) of n-butyl bromide (p. 28) and 2 l. of anhydrous ethyl ether are added. As soon as the reaction starts, 350 cc. of anhydrous ether is added, and the remainder of the n-butyl bromide solution is dropped in at such a rate that the mixture boils continuously. The time of addition (one and one-half hours) may be decreased by cooling the flask externally. Stirring is started as soon as enough liquid is present in the flask.\nWhen all has been added (Note 2), 278 g. (6.3 moles) of ethylene oxide (Note 3) (previously dried with soda lime) is added through a tube (3 or 4 mm. in diameter) the end of which is about 20 mm. above the surface of the liquid (Note 4), the temperature being kept below 10\u00b0 by cooling in an efficient ice-and-salt bath (Note 5). This addition requires four to six hours. When all has been added the ice bath is removed; the temperature of the mixture generally rises enough to cause gentle boiling. When this ceases the mixture is warmed on a steam bath for one hour longer.\nThe condenser is then arranged for downward distillation, and when about 1 l. of ether has distilled (Note 6) the receiver is changed and 1 l. of dry benzene (Note 7) is added; distillation is continued with stirring until the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 65\u00b0. The mixture is then boiled under reflux for one hour. Usually by this time it has become so viscous that stirring is no longer efficient. The mixture is then allowed to cool and is decomposed with 2 l. of an ice-water mixture. The precipitated magnesium hydroxide is dissolved by adding a sufficient quantity of 30 per cent sulfuric acid and enough ice to keep the mixture cold.\nThe mixture of benzene and hexyl alcohol is now distilled in a current of steam; about 7 l. of distillate must be collected before all the product is distilled. The oily layer is separated and the watery portion distilled until free of hexyl alcohol. The oil so obtained is added to the main quantity and the watery portion again distilled. The united product is now stirred on the steam bath for one to two hours with 1 l. of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and again subjected to steam distillation, as before. The oily product so obtained is then distilled under atmospheric pressure with the use of a good fractionating column. The fraction boiling up to 85\u00b0 is mostly benzene and water. The fraction boiling between 85\u00b0 and 154\u00b0 is collected separately for redistillation, and the fraction boiling at 154\u2013157\u00b0 collected as pure material. There is practically no high-boiling residue. The yield (Note 7) is 368\u2013380 g. (60\u201362 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8)."

            "In a 4-l. wide-mouthed glass jar, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed a solution of 150 g. (3 moles) of sodium cyanide (Note 1) in 500 cc. of water and 318 g. (3 moles) of u.s.p. benzaldehyde. The stirrer is started, and 850 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite (Note 2) is added to the mixture, slowly at first and then in a thin stream. The time of addition is ten to fifteen minutes. During the addition of the first half of this solution, 900 g. of cracked ice is added to the reaction mixture, a handful at a time. The layer of mandelonitrile which appears during the addition of the sulfite solution is separated from the water in a separatory funnel. The water is extracted once with about 150 cc. of benzene, the benzene is evaporated, and the residual mandelonitrile is added to the main portion.\nThe crude nitrile (about 290 cc.) is placed at once (Note 3) in a 25-cm. evaporating dish, and 425 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The hydrolysis is allowed to proceed in the cold (Note 4) for about twelve hours, after which the mixture is heated on a steam bath to remove the water and excess hydrochloric acid. After heating for five to six hours it is advisable to cool the mixture (Note 5) and filter the ammonium chloride and mandelic acid mixture that separates. The filtrate is then evaporated to dryness. This residue is added to the solid material obtained before. The product is deeply colored and must be dried in the air and light for at least twenty-four hours. The total yield of the crude mandelic acid-ammonium chloride mixture is 370\u2013390 g., depending on the amount of moisture. The mixture of ammonium chloride and mandelic acid is ground in a mortar, transferred to a 2-l. flask, and washed twice with 750-cc. portions of cold benzene (Note 6). The insoluble portion is transferred to a suction funnel and sucked dry.\nEither of two methods may be used to extract the mandelic acid from the ammonium chloride.\n(A) Extraction with Benzene.\u2014The mandelic acid is separated from the ammonium chloride by extraction with hot benzene. This is best done by dividing the solid mixture into ten approximately equal parts (Note 7). One of these portions is placed in a flask with 1 l. of boiling benzene. After a few minutes the hot benzene solution is decanted through a suction funnel (Note 8). The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath and the mandelic acid that crystallizes is filtered with suction. The benzene is returned to the extraction flask containing the residue from the first extraction, and a new portion of the ammonium chloride-mandelic acid mixture is added and extracted as before. The process is repeated until the mandelic acid is completely removed from the ammonium chloride (Note 9).\nThe yield of pure white mandelic acid melting at 118\u00b0 is 229\u2013235 g. (50\u201352 per cent of the theoretical amount based on benzaldehyde).\n(B) Extraction with Ether (Note 10).\u2014The solid mixture is transferred to a 2-l. flask and shaken ten minutes with 750 cc. of ether. The ether solution is decanted through a suction filter and the solid thrown onto the filter and pressed dry. The solid is then returned to the flask and shaken with 400 cc. of ether. This mixture is filtered by suction and the solid washed twice on the filter with 250-cc. portions of ether. Each portion is allowed to drain through the filter several times while the solid is kept porous with a spatula. The combined ether filtrate is then filtered through an ordinary funnel (Note 11). The ether solution is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, and 750 cc. of toluene (Note 12) is added. The mixture is distilled on a steam bath through an efficient fractionating column as long as it distils easily, and about 1100\u20131400 cc. of distillate is collected. The temperature of the vapor rises to about 70\u00b0. The mixture is then heated over a free flame until the temperature in the column is 95\u00b0; about 300 cc. distils (Note 13). The residual liquid is poured while still hot into a large beaker immersed in ice water. The liquid (about 900 cc.) is stirred by hand until it has become a thick crystal mush. The cooling is continued for two hours with occasional stirring so as to bring the temperature down to 5\u201310\u00b0. The mixture is filtered with suction and the solid pressed dry. It is then thoroughly washed on the filter with 300 cc. of toluene in several portions (Note 14).\nThe yield is the same as that obtained by method (A) (Note 15)."

(251 cc., 6.2 moles) of anhydrous methyl alcohol (Note 1), with ice cooling and exclusion of moisture, until the increase in weight amounts to 5 g. This solution is then diluted with 1800 g. of methyl alcohol, a 0.25 per cent solution of hydrogen chloride being thus obtained. To this is added 500 g. (2.77 moles) of finely powdered anhydrous d-glucose (Note 2), and the mixture boiled under reflux for seventy-two hours, a clear solution being obtained after the first fifteen minutes' boiling. It is well to attach a soda-lime tube to the upper end of the condenser, in order to exclude moisture. The clear pale yellow solution is cooled to 0\u00b0, and crystallization induced by scratching or by inoculation with a trace of \u03b1-methyl d-glucoside. After twelve hours at 0\u00b0 the first crop is filtered by suction and washed twice with 100-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. The yield is 85\u2013120 g. of a product melting at 165\u00b0.\nThe mother liquor and washings are returned to the flask and again boiled for seventy-two hours under reflux. The liquid is concentrated to 800 cc. and again chilled to 0\u00b0, inoculated, and allowed to stand at 0\u00b0 for twenty-four hours. The second crop of glucoside so obtained is filtered by suction and washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. This yield is 110\u2013145 g., melting at 164\u2013165\u00b0. The mother liquor and washings are combined and concentrated to about 300 cc., chilled to 0\u00b0, and again inoculated and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The resulting mush of crystals is diluted with twice its weight of absolute methyl alcohol, and, after standing twenty-four hours at 0\u00b0, the third crop of glucoside is filtered (Note 3). This is recrystallized from 2.5 parts of methyl alcohol. The yield is 30\u201336 g., melting at 164\u2013165\u00b0.\nThe total yield amounts to 260\u2013266 g.

            "(A) Preparation of sec.-Octyl Hydrogen Phthalate.\u2014A mixture of 130 g. (1 mole) of sec.-octyl alcohol (p. 366) and 148 g. (1 mole) of phthalic anhydride is heated for twelve to fifteen hours in a flask surrounded by an oil bath at 110\u2013115\u00b0 (Note 1). During the heating the mixture should be mechanically stirred or shaken occasionally to give a homogeneous liquid. The cooled reaction mixture is added to about 8 l. of water which contains 150 g. (1.4 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate. The solid material gradually goes into solution, and if the resulting solution is perfectly clear, dilute hydrochloric acid is added in slight excess, thus precipitating the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate as an oil which rapidly turns to a solid; if the alkaline solution is not clear, owing to the presence of methyl hexyl ketone in the original alcohol, it should be extracted with ether to remove the ketone before acidifying with hydrochloric acid.\nThe octyl hydrogen phthalate is filtered, washed with water, ground thoroughly with water in a mortar, and finally filtered and dried. For complete purification it may be crystallized either from petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201370\u00b0) or glacial acetic acid, from which it separates as needles melting at 55\u00b0. The crude material, however, is perfectly satisfactory for the following experiments. The yield is nearly quantitative if the sec.-octyl alcohol is pure (Note 2) and (Note 3).\n(B) Resolution.\u2014A warm solution of 278 g. (1 mole) of sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate and 600 cc. of acetone is treated with 394 g. (1 mole) of brucine and the mixture warmed until the solution is clear. Upon cooling, the crystals of brucine salt (A) form. These are filtered, pressed, and washed in the funnel with 250 cc. of acetone. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to about 50 per cent of their original volume and then poured into dilute hydrochloric acid (slightly more than the calculated amount), which causes the precipitation of the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate. After the precipitate sets to a crystalline mass, it is filtered, washed with cold water, and dried. This weighs approximately one-half of the original ester used and has a rotation [\u03b1]5461 \u2212 47\u00b0 in absolute alcohol solution (Note 4).\nThe crystals (A) are dissolved in the minimum amount of hot ethyl alcohol and decomposed by pouring the solution into dilute hydrochloric acid. The weight of the ester thus obtained is about one-half of that originally taken, and its rotation in absolute alcohol is about [\u03b1]5461 +47\u00b0, [\u03b1]D +44\u00b0.\nThe two lots of crude active sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate are now separately crystallized twice from acetic acid (about 2 g. of 90 per cent acetic acid should be used for each gram of solid). They are thus obtained in an optically pure condition and possess the rotations [\u03b1]5461 \u2212 58.5\u00b0, [\u03b1]D \u2212 48.4\u00b0 and [\u03b1]5461 +58.3\u00b0, [\u03b1]D +48.4\u00b0, respectively. The amount of pure product, m.p. 75\u00b0, obtained in each case is respectively about 99 g. and 96 g. (about 70 per cent of the theoretical amount). The sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate of low optical activity obtained by adding water to the acetic acid filtrates can be collected and used in a subsequent preparation.\n(C) Hydrolysis.\u2014Optically pure l- and d-sec.-octyl alcohols are obtained by distillation in a current of steam of the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate and 2 moles of sodium hydroxide in 30 per cent solution. The alcohols are practically insoluble in water and are separated, dried with potassium carbonate, and distilled. Each boils at 86\u00b0/20 mm. and has a rotation [\u03b1]17\u00b05461 + 11.8\u00b0, [\u03b1]17\u00b0D + 9.9\u00b0 or [\u03b1]17\u00b05461 \u2212 11.8\u00b0, [\u03b1]17\u00b0D \u2212 9.9\u00b0. The yields of alcohol from the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalates are about 95 per cent of the calculated amounts."

            "In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 68 g. of phenylurea (0.5 mole) (Note 1) and 120 cc. (1 mole) of 42 per cent hydrazine hydrate solution (Note 2). The flask is heated on a steam bath for about twelve hours. The hot mixture is treated with a small amount of decolorizing charcoal (Norite) and filtered. The charcoal is washed with two 15-cc. portions of warm water, and the filtrate and washings are then concentrated on a steam bath to about 100 cc. On cooling in an ice bath a crop of crystals separates which is collected on a filter and washed with two 15-cc. portions of cold water. The filtrate and washings are concentrated to about 25 cc., and another crop of crystals is obtained as before. The total yield of crude compound is 47\u201352 g. It is white at first but sometimes turns brown on drying. It usually melts below 115\u00b0 because of some unchanged phenylurea.\nThe product is purified (Note 3) by conversion to the hydrochloride, which is then changed into the free base.\nA filtered solution of the crude product in 200 cc. of hot absolute alcohol is treated with 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Most of the hydrochloride precipitates at once and is filtered, washed with alcohol, and dried. The filtrate is cooled in an ice-salt bath and again filtered, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and added to the previous portion. The yield is 46\u201348 g. of material melting at about 215\u00b0 (Note 4). The hydrochloride is dissolved in three times its weight of water, previously heated nearly to boiling (Note 5). The solution is filtered if necessary and then treated with sodium hydroxide solution (2.2 g. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution for each gram of hydrochloride used). The free base separates at once, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath and filtered. This product melts at 120\u2013123\u00b0. The yield of pure base is 28\u201330 g. (37\u201340 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6)."

            "One hundred fifteen grams (0.9 mole) of p-chlorophenol, 300 g. (2.0 moles) of phthalic anhydride, 50 g. of crystallized boric acid, and 2 kg. (1090 cc.) of 95 per cent sulfuric acid are thoroughly mixed in a 1.5-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is then immersed to the neck in an oil bath and the temperature gradually raised to 200\u00b0 during the course of one-half to three-quarters of an hour (Note 1). It is then kept constant at 200\u00b0 for three and one-half hours. Owing to the tendency of the phthalic anhydride to sublime, the mouth of the flask is covered with a piece of porous plate. When cool, the colored melt is poured slowly into 5 l. of cold water with continuous stirring, and filtered. The precipitate is boiled with 10 l. of water and filtered hot to remove the excess of phthalic anhydride which goes into solution. The residue is then suspended in 10 l. of boiling water, and to this suspension is added a sufficient quantity of 10 N potassium hydroxide solution to produce a purple color (about 30 cc.), followed by 300 cc. more (Note 2). The alkaline solution is filtered hot, and the residue (about 5\u201310 g.) is washed with 200 cc. of hot 2 per cent potassium hydroxide solution and discarded.\nThe purple quinizarin solution is next saturated with carbon dioxide and the precipitated quinizarin again filtered. The product is then boiled with 5 l. of a 10 per cent solution of sodium carbonate until it appears black (probably the monosodium salt) to dissolve the last traces of purpurin. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the precipitate is boiled with 5 l. of 5 per cent hydrochloric acid to liberate the quinizarin. The mixture is again cooled to room temperature, and the final product is filtered, washed with cold water, and dried at 100\u00b0.\nThe yield is 147\u2013160 g. (68\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount). It sinters at 190\u2013191\u00b0 and melts at 199\u2013200\u00b0 (corr.). A sample twice recrystallized from glacial acetic acid melted at 200\u2013202\u00b0 (corr.) (Note 3). The crystal form of this product compares very favorably with that of quinizarin of the highest purity, as observed under the microscope."

            "In a copper or iron kettle of 4-l. capacity is placed a solution of 200 g. (1.33 moles) of d-tartaric acid and 700 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1400 cc. of water. A 12-l. flask through which cold water is run is placed in the mouth of the kettle in order to prevent loss of water vapor, and the mixture is boiled gently over an open flame for four hours. The solution is now transferred to a 12-l. flask or crock and partially neutralized with 1400 cc. of commercial hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). To the still alkaline solution is now added just enough sodium sulfide to precipitate all the iron or copper which has been dissolved from the kettle (Note 1). The filtered solution is then just acidified with hydrochloric acid, boiled to expel all hydrogen sulfide, and made very faintly alkaline to phenolphthalein with sodium hydroxide solution. To the hot solution is then added a concentrated solution of 300 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride which causes an immediate precipitation of calcium dl-tartrate and meso-tartrate.\nThe mixture is allowed to stand for one week (Note 2) and the precipitate filtered, washed with cold water until free of chlorides, and dried at 40\u201350\u00b0. The yield is 246\u2013315 g. The product is found on analysis to consist principally of the tetrahydrate, C4H4O6Ca\u00b74H2O (Note 3). It is suspended in 800 cc. of water and treated with the calculated quantity (0.4 g. for every 1.0 g.) of concentrated (95\u201396 per cent) sulfuric acid. The mixture is warmed on the steam bath, with occasional shaking, or mechanical stirring, for thirty to forty hours (Note 4), filtered hot, and the calcium sulfate washed well with hot distilled water.\nThe united filtrate is evaporated on the steam bath until the volume amounts to 200 cc., at which point crystals should have already begun to separate from the hot solution. After standing at room temperature for twenty-four hours or longer, the crystals are filtered by suction as free from mother liquor as possible and recrystallized from an equal weight of distilled water (Note 5). The filtrate from this recrystallization is evaporated on the steam bath and the second crop of dl-tartaric acid filtered and recrystallized as before. The yield is 65\u201375 g. (29\u201333.4 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe sirupy filtrate from the dl-tartaric acid, which consists principally of meso-tartaric acid together with a small amount of unchanged d-tartaric acid, is diluted with its own volume of water and divided into two equal parts; one part is exactly neutralized with potassium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein, and the second part is added. After standing for twenty-four hours the potassium hydrogen d-tartrate is filtered off. The filtrate is neutralized with ammonia, then just acidified with acetic acid, and treated with an excess of calcium chloride solution (about 500 cc. of a 25 per cent solution). After standing for a week (Note 2) the precipitated calcium meso-tartrate is filtered and washed with cold distilled water. It may, if desired, be recrystallized from boiling water. The yield is 42\u201355 g. (corresponding to 13\u201317 per cent of the original d-tartaric acid). The sirupy free acid may be prepared from this salt by treatment with sulfuric acid as above."

            "(A) Preparation of Thiocarbonyl Perchloride.\u2014In a 5-l. bottle arranged for cooling by running water is placed 500 g. (398 cc., 6.58 moles) of dry carbon disulfide (Note 1) to which 0.5 g. of iodine has been added. Dry chlorine is passed into the cooled carbon disulfide at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 25\u00b0, until the liquid weighs 1770 g. (17.9 moles of chlorine) (Note 2). The time required is about forty hours. The product, a mixture of impure thiocarbonyl perchloride and sulfur chloride, is a deep red liquid.\nThe apparatus illustrated in Fig. 27 is assembled, in a large hood if possible (Note 3). A is a 5-l. round-bottomed flask heated by a large ring burner and provided with a specially treated four-holed cork stopper covered with tin foil (Note 4). To these holes are fitted the column D, the tube B reaching to the bottom of A, the specially bent tube C reaching up the inside of D, and the tube K connected with the tubes leading to the 2-l. separatory funnel H, so that the distance between the stopper of A and the stopcock of H is at least 100 cm. The bottom of the column D is of 20-mm. bore; the main portion is of 30 mm.\nFig. 27.\nThe side arm should be at least 85 cm. above the stopper of A. The tube C should reach about half way up the inside of the column D. The column is filled with pieces of 3-mm. glass tubing about 5 mm. long. Its top is provided with a cork covered with tin foil and fitted fairly loosely so as to blow out in case of a clogging of the apparatus. It should be held by a wire to prevent its being blown out entirely. Tubes B and C are connected with a steam line or steam generator of large capacity. The separatory funnel H is placed at the highest available level (Note 5) and connected with the tubes I, J, and K in such a manner as to secure a pressure of liquid sufficient to more than balance the steam pressure (Note 6). E and F are specially constructed condensers of unusual length (160 cm. and 85 cm., respectively) and bore (40 mm.) made from large glass tubing and rubber stoppers (Note 7). The top of condenser F is connected to a good draft chamber or to a gas-absorption trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97). G is a 5-l., or better, a 12-l. round-bottomed flask which is used as a receiver.\nThe crude chlorinated mixture is steam-distilled in this special apparatus to obtain thiocarbonyl perchloride and to decompose the sulfur chloride. In flask A is placed 1210 cc. of water which is heated to boiling by means of the ring burner. Steam is passed in through tubes B and C. The chlorinated mixture is placed in the separatory funnel H, and the connecting tubes are filled with the liquid which is allowed to pass into A at about 5 drops per second (Note 8). Sulfur begins to separate in the column and in the condensers. The steam distillation requires about five hours and gives 10\u201312 l. of distillate consisting of water, sulfur, and a heavy red oil. The water is decanted and the rest of the mixture is filtered by suction through glass wool. The oil is separated and dried over about 10 g. of calcium chloride.\nThe crude, dry thiocarbonyl perchloride is distilled through an efficient 60-cm. column (Note 9). The distillate below 140\u00b0 is discarded. The fraction boiling at 140\u2013155\u00b0 at atmospheric pressure amounts to about 600 g. The boiling point of pure thiocarbonyl perchloride is 149\u00b0.\n(B) Reduction of Thiocarbonyl Perchloride to Thiophosgene.\u2014The apparatus illustrated in Fig. 28 is assembled. A is a 5-l. round-bottomed flask heated by a ring burner and provided with a two-holed, specially treated cork (Note 4) carrying tube B of about 40-cm. length connected with condenser C of about 115-cm. length, and tube R which conveys the perchloride from the separatory funnel T (Note 6). R is 6-mm. tubing of about 90-cm. length and must reach to the bottom of A. D and G are specially blown connecting tubes, D reaching through the cork of F and G reaching to the bottom of the 5-l. flask, F. Each arm of D is about 20 cm. long and of 2-cm. bore. The vertical arm of G is of about 3-cm. bore and its side arm of about 1-cm. bore. H and I are efficient bulb condensers at least 60 cm. long. F is provided with siphon E for removing the product. L is a tall tower (about 50 cm. in length) packed with short pieces of glass tubing alternating with layers of glass wool. Its stopper carries the tube K reaching to the bottom of the tower, a separatory funnel, and an exit tube M leading to the draft. P is a siphon for removing the xylene wash liquid.\nFig. 28.\nIn the flask A are placed 750 g. (6.3 atoms) of granulated tin (Note 10) and 1500 cc. of commercial hydrochloric acid (about 28 per cent). The mixture is heated until the action is vigorous. The thiocarbonyl perchloride is run in from the funnel T (Note 11). The resulting reaction is very violent. The vapors are condensed in the series of condensers and in the scrubber L through which xylene is allowed to flow slowly from the separatory funnel N. Most of the crude thiophosgene collects in F, although a small amount is obtained from the distillation of the xylene wash liquid.\nThe crude thiophosgene is separated and dried with about 10 g. of calcium chloride, and fractionated with a good column. Very little distils below 73\u00b0. The fraction boiling at 73\u201376\u00b0 at atmospheric pressure is pure thiophosgene and amounts to about 180 g. (24 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 12). The fraction above 76\u00b0 is largely thiocarbonyl perchloride and may be again reduced or added to the reduction in a subsequent run."

When all has been added, the bulk of the product is transferred to a 12-l. flask containing 8 l. of cold water, and the remainder washed in with water. The product, after agitation with water, is now a light-yellow, fluffy solid; it is filtered off by suction and washed well with water (Note 2).\n(B) Aminothymol.\u2014The crude, wet nitrosothymol so obtained is worked up with a mixture of 900 cc. of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and 1600 cc. of water; the brown solution is filtered free of a little resinous matter, and hydrogen sulfide is passed into it. The brown color disappears and a white precipitate of aminothymol forms. The passage of hydrogen sulfide is continued for thirty minutes longer (Note 3), when the base is filtered and washed well with cold water, contact with air being avoided as far as possible (Note 4).\n(C) Thymoquinone.\u2014The wet aminothymol thus prepared is immediately dissolved in 110 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid diluted to 4 l. and contained in a 12-l. flask. To this solution is added 150 g. (2.08 moles) of sodium nitrite, in 5\u201310 g. portions, with shaking after each addition. The resulting mixture is heated to 60\u00b0 on a steam bath, with occasional shaking, for one-half hour (Note 5), and is then distilled in a current of steam, by means of the apparatus described on p. 479 (Note 6). All the thymoquinone passes over with the first 3 l. of distillate; it solidifies on cooling, and is filtered with suction (Note 7), washed, and dried at room temperature. The yield is 80\u201387 g. (73\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount) of bright yellow crystals, melting at 43\u201345\u00b0 (Note 8)."

            "In the container A (Fig. 30) is placed 1500 g. of crushed nutmegs (Note 1) moistened with ether (Note 2). A is a 3-l. inverted aspirator bottle connected by a 3-mm. glass tube to the efficient condenser C, and by 3-mm. tubing, one end of which is provided with a Soxhlet thimble to the 2-l. round-bottomed flask B. Flask B is connected by 3-mm. tubing of 75-cm. length to C. In B are placed 500 cc. of ether and a few chips of clay plate to prevent superheating. B is then heated on a steam cone so that the ether boils rapidly enough to reach the condenser C and to flow back through A.\nFig. 30.\nThe extraction with ether is continued until the ether leaving the insoluble solid is entirely colorless. This requires twenty-four to seventy-two hours, according to the state of subdivision of the nutmegs and the rate at which the ether is passed through. The ethereal solution is then freed of a small quantity of entrained insoluble matter by filtering through a folded paper. This filtration may advantageously be completed in the type of extractor described on p. 375. The clear solution is now entirely freed from ether by distillation on the water bath. The residue weighs 640\u2013690 g. On cooling it sets to a mass of crystals of trimyristin which is filtered with suction (Note 3) and washed with 225 cc. of cold 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in small portions. The product is now recrystallized from 3.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; it is stirred mechanically during cooling since the trimyristin tends to separate as an oil at the outset (Note 4). The crystallized trimyristin is then filtered off by suction and washed with 350-400 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol in small portions. The crystals, which are colorless and practically odorless, melt at 54\u201355\u00b0. The yield is 330\u2013364 g."

            "A solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 800 cc. of water is prepared in a 2-l. beaker. To the warm solution is added 211 g. (1 mole) of 3-nitrophthalic acid (p. 408) (Note 1). A small amount of insoluble material is removed by filtration through a large preheated B\u00fcchner funnel (Note 2). A solution of 350 g. (1.1 moles) of mercuric acetate (Note 3) in a mixture of 50 cc. of glacial acetic acid and 700 cc. of water is prepared by heating and filtering while hot (Note 4). The two hot solutions are poured into a 3-l. long-necked flask and mixed by shaking. No precipitate should separate (Note 5). The flask is clamped in a large oil bath (Note 6) with the level of the oil almost to the neck of the flask. It is fitted with a reflux condenser provided with a tube leading to a large beaker placed on the desk (Note 7).\nThe temperature of the oil bath is raised to 170\u00b0 over a period of about one hour. If any considerable amount of material is driven through the condenser, it is poured back through the top of the condenser as soon as the reaction slackens. The heating at 165\u2013175\u00b0 is continued for about seventy hours. After about sixty hours the end of the tube leading from the top of the condenser is introduced below the surface of about 1 cc. of mercury in a small test tube. The evolution of carbon dioxide can be followed by observing the bubbles which pass through the mercury. When not more than one or two bubbles escape per minute, the heating is discontinued (Note 8).\nThe product is allowed to settle and the hot supernatant liquid is poured through a preheated suction filter. The filtrate deposits less than 10 g. of crude product on cooling. The product in the flask is shaken with several 100-cc. portions of water, and all the fine material is transferred to the filter. Some lumpy material is usually left in the flask. This is transferred to a large mortar and ground to a paste with a little water and then transferred to the filter. After sucking as dry as possible, the suction is shut off, and 100 cc. of alcohol is poured over the material on the filter. After standing a few minutes, suction is again applied. The product is then dried to constant weight (Note 9). The yield of anhydro-2-hydroxymercuri-3-nitrobenzoic acid is 300\u2013330 g. (82\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the 3-nitrophthalic acid used).

When about two-thirds of the benzoic acid is in the flask the mixture is melted to make room for the rest. The flask is placed in a large oil bath and connected to a condenser for distillation. The temperature of the oil is raised quickly to 180\u2013190\u00b0, at which point distillation starts. The bath is held at this temperature until practically no more aniline and water distil (about two hours), and then the temperature is slowly raised to 225\u00b0 and maintained at this temperature until no further distillation takes place (one to two hours). The oil bath is now removed and the contents of the flask are allowed to cool below 180\u00b0 and 550 g. (5.9 moles) of aniline is added. The distillations at 190\u00b0 and 225\u00b0 are repeated (about six hours). The hot mixture is poured into two 20-cm. evaporating dishes (Hood) and is allowed to cool. The crude product weighs 1600\u20132000 g., depending on the amount of aniline retained.\nThe purplish-gray solid is ground (Note 2) in a large mortar and is poured with vigorous stirring into a 12-l. (3-gallon) crock containing 6 l. of approximately normal hydrochloric acid (5.5 l. of water and 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid). The stirring is continued for one hour after all the benzanilide has been added, and then the solid is filtered on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. The process of stirring with acid and filtering is repeated twice to remove the excess of aniline. The solid is stirred for two hours with 6 l. of water and is filtered. It is stirred for one hour with 6 l. of normal sodium hydroxide solution to remove the excess of benzoic acid and is then filtered. The stirring with alkali and filtering is repeated. The solid is next stirred for two hours with 7 l. of water and is filtered, sucked dry, and air-dried overnight on paper.\nAfter drying on paper the purplish solid is dried to constant weight in three 20-cm. evaporating dishes at 90\u2013100\u00b0 (about two days) and is then repowdered. The product is light purplish-gray and weighs 1270\u20131325 g. (80\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 157\u2013160\u00b0.

The hot solution is decanted from any solid into a specially prepared solution of 30.5 g. (0.54 mole) of potassium hydroxide (Note 3). A precipitate of potassium phthalimide separates at once. The mixture is stirred and cooled quickly to room temperature, and the precipitate is filtered with suction. To the alcoholic mother liquors a second 80-g. portion of phthalimide is added, and the entire process is repeated. The two crops of crystals are united (Note 4) and washed with 200 cc. of acetone to remove any unchanged phthalimide. The yield of air-dried potassium phthalimide is 160\u2013180 g. (80\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) \u03b2-Bromoethylphthalimide.\u2014In a 1-l. two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 150 g. (0.81 mole) of potassium phthalimide and 450 g. (2.4 moles) of ethylene dibromide (Note 5). The stirrer is started and the mixture is heated for about twelve hours in an oil bath maintained at 180\u2013190\u00b0. The condenser is then set for distillation, and the excess of ethylene dibromide is distilled under reduced pressure. The recovery of the bromide amounts to 290\u2013295 g. (Note 6).\nThe crude bromoethylphthalimide is extracted from the potassium bromide by refluxing with 300 cc. of alcohol (98\u2013100 per cent) (Note 7) until the dark oil is entirely dissolved. This requires about one-half. hour. The hot solution is filtered with suction, and the residue of salt is washed with a little hot alcohol. The alcohol is distilled under reduced pressure, and the dry residue is refluxed with 500 cc. of carbon disulfide for about fifteen minutes in order to separate the soluble bromoethylphthalimide from the insoluble diphthalimidoethane (Note 8). The warm solution is filtered with suction. The carbon disulfide is distilled under diminished pressure (Note 9). The bromoethylphthalimide remains as light tan crystals which melt at 78\u201380\u00b0. The yield is 140\u2013160 g. (69\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe product thus obtained is pure enough for most purposes. However, a purer product may be obtained by recrystallization from dilute alcohol in the presence of decolorizing carbon. When 50 g. of crude product is dissolved in 200 cc. of 75 per cent alcohol, boiled for about ten minutes with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite), filtered, and the solution cooled to 0\u00b0, 40 g. of white product is obtained. The recrystallized product melts at 80\u201381\u00b0. A second recrystallization raises the melting point to 82\u201383\u00b0."

To the hot solution is added, in small quantities, 330 g. (0.9 mole) of anhydro-2-hydroxymercuri-3-nitrobenzoic acid (p. 56) (Note 1). The mixture is stirred after the addition of each portion of about 50 g. until the material has gone into solution except for a small residue. The flask is then fitted with a stirrer and addition tube (Note 2) and with a connection to a reflux condenser. The material is heated to boiling and stirred vigorously. There is slowly added, with continuous stirring, 101 g. (85 cc., 0.95 mole) (Note 3) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). Heating is discontinued at this point, and 31.5 g. (30 cc., 0.5 mole) of glacial acetic acid (sp. gr. 1.05) (Note 3) is added slowly. A curdy precipitate forms.\nA solution of bromine is prepared by dissolving 103 g. (1 mole) of sodium bromide and 160 g. (50.2 cc., 1 mole) of bromine in 150 cc. of water (Note 4). The mixture is stirred, and the bromine solution is added as rapidly as possible through the shaft of the stirrer. The precipitate dissolves. The solution is heated to boiling for five minutes after the last of the bromine has been added. The solution is then made slightly alkaline by the addition of 20 g. (0.5 mole) of solid sodium hydroxide and filtered through a fluted filter. The filtrate is then made acid to Congo red, using about 150 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitated 2-bromo-3-nitrobenzoic acid is filtered with suction and sucked as dry as possible. It is then crystallized from 1 l. of hot 30 per cent alcohol. The yield of product melting at 185\u2013187\u00b0 is 130\u2013150 g. (53\u201361 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the 3-nitrophthalic acid used).

The mixture is stirred and heated as near boiling as possible for fifteen minutes. The highest temperature conveniently obtainable is 95\u00b0. The tolylmercuric chloride dissolves (Note 1), forming the sodium salt of p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid. The solution is cooled somewhat and alcohol is added to react with the excess of potassium permanganate (250 cc. is generally required to completely decolorize the solution). The manganese dioxide thus precipitated is removed by filtering with suction (Note 2). The filtrate should be clear and colorless. (If it is green, not enough alcohol has been added.)\nAfter the filtrate has become thoroughly cool (Note 3), it is acidified with hydrochloric acid, about 1700 cc. of technical concentrated acid being necessary. The precipitated p-chloromercuribenzoic acid is difficult to filter because of its flocculent character. It is best to allow it to stand at least overnight and then filter by suction after siphoning most of the clear supernatant liquid. The acid retains much water and should be dried at 110\u00b0 (Note 4). The yield is 350\u2013420 g. (61\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude acid may be purified by reprecipitation with hydrochloric acid from a solution in sodium hydroxide (Note 5). The crude acid is sufficiently pure for the preparation of p-iodobenzoic acid (p. 325). It can be used for this purpose without drying."

(1.3 moles) of crystalline sodium carbonate (decahydrate) (Note 1), the mixture being gently warmed. The neutralization is completed by adding sodium carbonate solution using litmus paper as an indicator. The flask is transferred to the hood, and a solution of 130 g. (2.65 moles) of sodium cyanide in 250 cc. of warm water is added in two approximately equal portions, waiting after the first addition until no further evolution of heat occurs, or the mixture ceases to boil. The cooled solution is neutralized with hydrochloric acid, using methyl orange as an outside indicator. The solution is then diluted with water to 1 l. and filtered; it should be of a light straw color. It can be kept for long periods of time in a stoppered bottle, although the color deepens somewhat.\n(B) Condensation with Benzaldehyde.\u2014To 400 cc. (1.06 moles) of the sodium cyanoacetate solution is added a solution of 5 g. (0.13 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 400 cc. of water. The resulting alkaline solution is warmed to 40\u00b0 and treated with 100 g. (0.94 mole) of benzaldehyde which has been shaken with sodium carbonate solution and distilled under reduced pressure. The benzaldehyde dissolves after vigorous shaking for a few minutes. After standing one hour, during which time some of the sodium cyanophenylacrylate crystallizes (Note 2), the mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid until acid to litmus and 40 cc. additional concentrated acid added, and the whole is shaken vigorously. After another hour, the crystalline cyanophenylacrylic acid is filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, washed thoroughly with cold water, and dried in a steam oven. It is then shaken with 100 cc. of benzene, filtered on a B\u00fcchner funnel, and further washed with 50 cc. of benzene and dried. The yield of product melting at 178\u2013179\u00b0 is 105\u2013115 g. (65\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product may have a slight pinkish color, which can be removed by recrystallization from 740 cc. of alcohol or 10 l. of hot water.

The flask is fitted with a two-holed cork stopper which carries a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The top of the condenser is provided with a calcium chloride tube; the bulb of the thermometer reaches beneath the surface of the liquid.\nThe flask is warmed in a water bath until the appearance of a sudden exothermic reaction (Note 3), at which point the flask must be cooled at once by rotating it underneath the surface of cold water. The cooling is continued until the thermometer indicates a temperature of 125\u00b0 or less. The flask is then immersed in a bath of boiling water for about three hours, after which the mixture is cooled to about 50\u00b0, and poured slowly into 2.5 l. of warm (Note 4) dilute hydrochloric acid, made from 325 cc. (about 4 moles) of concentrated acid, contained in a large crock of about 15 l. (4 gal.) capacity. The mixture is left for about three hours until hydrolysis is complete (Note 5).\nAbout 8 l. of water is added to precipitate the p-dimethylaminobenzophenone. The solution, milky at first, soon deposits sandy crystals of light green color, which are collected on a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel. They are transferred to a beaker and washed with 1.5 l. of water, after which they are again collected on the filter, washed, pressed as dry as possible, and air dried.

The crystals are then separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging (Note 7). The yield of almost colorless crystals melting at 89.5\u201390.5\u00b0 is 80 g."

The suspension is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath. When the contents have cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0, a solution of 26.3 g. (0.38 mole) of sodium nitrite in 350 cc. of water is added from a dropping funnel during thirty minutes. The resulting diazonium solution is kept at a temperature below 5\u00b0 and, unless it is entirely clear, is filtered by suction through a chilled B\u00fcchner funnel immediately before use.\n(B) Preparation of the Reducing Agent.\u2014One hundred and twenty-six grams (0.505 mole) of hydrated cupric sulfate is dissolved in 500 cc. of water in a 2-l. beaker and 210 cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added. The solution is then cooled to 10\u00b0. A solution of 42 g. (0.256 mole) of commercial hydroxylammonium sulfate (Note 1) in 120 cc. of water is prepared and cooled to 10\u00b0; to this latter solution there is added 85 cc. of 6 N sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting solution of hydroxylamine is then filtered by suction if not clear. The hydroxylamine solution is immediately added to the ammoniacal cupric sulfate solution with hand stirring. Reduction occurs at once; a gas is evolved during the process, and the solution becomes pale blue in color. If this solution is not to be used at once it should be protected from the air.\n(C) Synthesis of Diphenic Acid.\u2014The reducing solution in the 2-l. beaker is surrounded by an ice bath so that the temperature of the solution is Kept at about 10\u00b0. The beaker is fitted with a mechanical stirrer. The stem of a 100-cc. cylindrical dropping funnel is fitted with a glass tube which dips well below the surface of the solution and is bent upward at the end and constricted so that the opening is about 2 mm. (Note 2). An 80- to 90-cc. portion of the diazonium solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added at the rate of about 10 cc. per minute (Note 3). The remainder of the diazonium solution is added at the same rate and stirring is continued for five minutes longer.\nThe solution is then rapidly heated to boiling and carefully acidified with 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Note 4). Diphenic acid precipitates as light brown crystals. After the solution has stood overnight the solid is removed by filtration and washed free of mother liquor while on the filter with about 50 cc. of cold water. When dried, the product melts at 222\u2013227\u00b0 (corr.) and weighs 39\u201340 g. (88\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nThe crude product is suspended in 200 cc. of water, and 40 g. of solid sodium bicarbonate is added. The resulting solution is filtered by gravity, then boiled with 0.1 g. of Norite. The mixture is filtered and the yellowish-brown filtrate is acidified while still hot with an excess of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The precipitated diphenic acid is collected on a filter and washed with 40 cc. of cold water. When dried at 100\u00b0 the product melts at 225\u2013228\u00b0 and weighs 32\u201337 g.

It is then refluxed until no more hydrogen bromide is evolved (about one hour).\nThe mixture is cooled and washed five times with 50-cc. portions of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution. It is then distilled under reduced pressure, fractions being taken up to 130\u00b0/40 mm. and at 130\u2013150\u00b0/40 mm. The residue amounts to about 20 g. (Note 3).

A small funnel F (about 3\u20134 cm. in diameter) is suspended directly under the outlets of the two separatory funnels and is attached to the rubber stopper by a loop of stiff copper wire. The discharge tube of the funnel is bent in the shape of a U so that its end is about 1 cm. below the top of the funnel. In the third hole of the rubber stopper is inserted an inclined glass tube, C, of about 10-mm. internal bore and approximately 50 cm. long. A mercury safety vent, D, is sealed in the side of this tube. C acts as an air condenser and leads to an empty gas bottle, E, of about 250-cc. capacity and then to three large U-tubes, G, H, and I, filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. The gas bottle and the U-tubes are contained in a water bath, W, warmed to 30\u201340\u00b0. The last calcium chloride tube is fitted with a three-way glass stopcock so that the gaseous anhydrous hydrogen cyanide may be used directly or diverted to an efficient condenser for liquefaction. The condenser is a glass coil of 4\u20135 mm. bore and about 50 cm. long that is surrounded by ice (Note 2) contained in a percolator arrangement like that described on p. 117.\nFig. 18.\nOne of the separatory funnels is filled with dilute sulfuric acid prepared by the careful addition of 392 g. (213 cc., 4 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid to 830 cc. of water. The other separatory funnel is filled with a solution of 203 g. (4 moles) of commercial sodium cyanide (about 96 per cent) dissolved in sufficient water to make 500 cc. of solution. Evolution of hydrogen cyanide takes place on the simultaneous addition of the two solutions. Practically all the reaction occurs in the funnel, F, and the sodium bisulfate solution continuously drains into the flask so that fresh solutions are always present. The solution in the funnel remains clear as long as sufficient sulfuric acid is present. An excess of sodium cyanide colors the solution yellow and leads to the formation of a muddy brown precipitate (Note 3). By adjusting the flow of solutions the rate of evolution is easily controlled, and the preparation requires no attention beyond that involved in the occasional replenishment of the solutions in the separatory funnels. The last part of the hydrogen cyanide can be driven from the apparatus by boiling the bisulfate solution for a few minutes. The yield of acid melting at \u2212 15\u00b0 to \u2212 14.5\u00b0 is 100\u2013105 g. (93\u201397 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 4) and (Note 5)."

The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in the bath, when the flask is fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper bearing a capillary tube reaching almost to the bottom and a delivery tube bent slightly downward for attachment to a suction pump. The flask is then heated slowly to 80\u00b0 during four hours by raising the temperature of the surrounding water. A rapid current of air is drawn through the mixture during the heating. The mixture is now evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure by heating in an oil bath, the temperature of which is raised as rapidly as the boiling of the material will permit. The oil bath is finally held at 125\u00b0 until the product becomes pasty. The flask is allowed to cool, and 50 cc. of water is poured down one side of the flask, and the solid material at that point worked carefully into a paste with a stout stirring rod.\nA cooled mixture of 200 g. (109 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (2 moles) and 300 cc. of water is now added slowly with careful cooling (Note 2), the pasty mixture being stirred with a thermometer and the temperature not being allowed to rise above 35\u00b0. Sodium sulfate crystallizes during this addition. The mass is now shaken vigorously with 400 cc. of ether and allowed to stand for some minutes. The ether is then decanted as completely as possible and the residue filtered with suction. The sodium sulfate is now shaken with six successive 300-cc. portions of ether, the ether solutions being subsequently employed for extraction of the filtrate. This latter requires 10\u201314 such extractions (each with 300\u2013400 cc. of ether) for the satisfactory extraction of the \u03b2-hydroxypropionic acid. The combined ethereal solution is dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and the ether distilled from a water bath, the temperature of which is not allowed to rise above 50\u00b0. The product is then concentrated under reduced pressure from a water bath maintained at 55\u201360\u00b0. The residue should have attained constant weight after four to six hours of this treatment; it consists of a sirupy liquid of pale straw color which contains 75\u201380 per cent of \u03b2-hydroxypropionic acid (by titration) (Note 3).

The acid gradually goes into solution and the color of iodine disappears. The hot stirred mixture is treated with iodine until a yellow color persists for at least ten minutes. This is conveniently done by weighing out iodine in 10-g. portions, dissolving in a little alcohol, and adding through the condenser. The total amount of iodine required depends on the purity of the mercurated acid. It should not exceed 210 g.

The latter may be removed by grinding the crystals in a mortar with water and enough sodium iodide or potassium iodide to destroy the red color of the mercuric iodide (Note 2).

The mixture is stirred at room temperature for four hours, during which time the monosubstituted acetoacetic ester is completely saponified and passes into solution. The mixture is then allowed to stand until the unsaponified material separates completely as an oily layer.

The cake is washed with 500 cc. of hot absolute methyl alcohol. The filtration is likely to be slow unless a large funnel (30 cm.) is used. The light yellow filtrate soon begins to deposit crystals (Note 8). It is kept in an ice box twenty to fifty hours. The crystals are filtered by suction, washed with 50 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol, then with 50 cc. of dry acetone, and dried on porous plates at room temperature. The yield is 480\u2013520 g. The mannoside is pure enough for most chemical purposes. It melts at about 170\u00b0 and has a rotation in water of + 78.6\u00b0. If a purer product is desired, the mannoside may be crystallized from four parts of 80 per cent ethyl alcohol with 80\u201390 per cent recovery if the mother liquors are worked up. Slight acidity in the solution used in recrystallization should be carefully neutralized with ammonia. The recrystallized mannoside melts at 188\u2013189\u00b0 and has a rotation of [\u03b1]20D + 80.8\u00b0."

When the mixture reaches 80\u00b0, the steam is shut off and 210 cc. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.51) is added slowly from a separatory funnel at such a rate as to maintain the temperature of the stirred mixture at 100\u2013110\u00b0.

After the fuming acid has been added, 900 cc. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is added as rapidly as possible without causing the temperature to rise above 110\u00b0 (Note 2). The mixture is then stirred and heated by passage of steam into the crock for two hours longer.\nThe mixture is allowed to stand overnight and then poured into 1.5 l. of water in a 4-l.

The mixture is stirred approximately every ten minutes. If no spontaneous reaction starts within one-half hour (Note 1), it is necessary to initiate the reaction by heating to 110\u2013120\u00b0. The mixture then becomes liquid and can be stirred easily. It turns to a light brown color, especially near the top where it comes in contact with the air. When the temperature begins to drop, the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 110\u00b0 for one hour to insure completion of the reaction.\nThe mixture is then poured into a mortar where it solidifies to a solid mass (Note 2). When cold, the mixture is ground up with water to remove most of the potassium bromide and filtered. The precipitate is then reground with water and refiltered, finally being washed well with water. The solid material on the filter consists of some potassium bromide, some phthalimide, and the ethyl phthalimidomalonate. Without drying, it is put into a 1-l. flask with 400 cc. of benzene and heated to boiling. After cooling, the insoluble bromide and phthalimide are removed by filtration.

When the temperature of the liquid reaches 275\u2013285\u00b0, phenol begins to distil. The heating is so regulated that the temperature of the vapor never exceeds 175\u00b0 and preferably remains below 170\u00b0 (Note 2). In this way the phenol distils at the rate of 5\u201310 drops per minute. The temperature of the liquid rises gradually (Note 3), and after six to seven hours reaches 350\u2013355\u00b0. At this point the distillation of the phenol practically ceases; the weight of the distillate is 220\u2013225 g.\nThe receiver is now changed, the lower thermometer is raised from the liquid (Note 4), and the contents of the flask distilled as rapidly as possible (Note 5). Heating is continued until the tarry residue begins to foam; towards the end of the distillation the color of the vapor becomes deep yellow with a greenish fluorescence. The distillate weighs 165\u2013170 g.; it is poured while still molten into a cold dish and allowed to cool, ground in a mortar with 100 cc. of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide, and warmed on the steam bath for ten to fifteen minutes with 400 cc. of this solution.

(85\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(B) Allyl Cyanide.\u2014In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser (Note 4) and a mechanical stirrer are placed 220 g. (1.83 moles) of allyl bromide (Note 5) and 170 g. (1.9 moles) of dry cuprous cyanide (Note 6). The mixture is heated in a water bath and the stirrer rotated slowly by hand until the reaction starts (about fifteen to thirty minutes). When the reaction once begins, it becomes vigorous, and the heating bath must be replaced by a cooling mixture of ice and water in order to avoid loss of product through the condenser. After the vigorous reaction has subsided, the water bath is replaced, the mechanical stirrer is started and the mixture is heated until no more allyl bromide refluxes. This requires about one hour.\nThe condenser is then set for distillation and the allyl cyanide is distilled from the flask by heating it in an oil bath with stirring (Note 7) and (Note 8). Upon redistillation, the allyl cyanide is pure and boils at 116\u2013121\u00b0 with almost no loss. The yield is 98\u2013103 g. (80\u201384 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

            "Five hundred grams of mesquite gum (Note 1) is dissolved (Note 2) in 3 l. of cold water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask; a cold solution of 125 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 80 cc. of water is added and the mixture warmed at 80\u00b0 for six hours (Note 3) in a large water bath. The acid is neutralized by gradual addition of 140 g. of powdered calcium carbonate (Note 4), and the solution with excess calcium carbonate is heated in a boiling water bath for one hour to complete the neutralization. The calcium sulfate is filtered off and washed with about 2 l. of hot water. The filtrate is concentrated in an evaporating dish (Note 5) on the boiling water bath to a volume of 650\u2013700 cc.\nThe solution is transferred to a 3-l. flask, using about 50 cc. of water for rinsing, and to it is added, with violent (Note 6) shaking, twice its volume (1400\u20131500 cc.) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The solution is decanted from the gummy residue and the latter extracted three times with methyl alcohol under reflux, each time with 500 cc. of the solvent. In order to remove all the arabinose from the salts the precipitate is dissolved in 200\u2013220 cc. of water, transferred to an evaporating dish, and 400 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is stirred in with a heavy rod. The clear alcohol solution is decanted and the solid triturated twice with 300-cc. portions of methyl alcohol. All the alcoholic extracts (both ethyl and methyl) are combined, shaken thoroughly, and 95 per cent ethyl alcohol added as long as any appreciable precipitate forms (Note 7). The solution is allowed to stand for some hours until it is clear, decanted, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a boiling-water bath to a thin sirup (Note 8). Crystallization usually begins as soon as the sirup is cool, though it is sometimes necessary to seed with arabinose.\nAfter crystallization has begun, 100 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is stirred in, care being taken not to precipitate any appreciable amount of gum. Crystallization is allowed to become complete in a cool place, occasionally stirring with a heavy rod. After about two days the crystalline arabinose is filtered off and washed with 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. To secure further crops of arabinose from the mother liquor and washings, the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure on the boiling-water bath, and the residual gum dissolved in 200 cc. of hot methyl alcohol (Note 9). The solution is cooled, seeded with arabinose if necessary, set in the refrigerator for at least one day and the arabinose filtered off.\nAfter the first two crops of crystals have been secured, the organic salts that originally dissolved along with the arabinose begin to interfere with the crystallization. To remove these, the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure on the boiling-water bath, the residue dissolved in approximately 200 cc. of boiling methyl alcohol, and 95 per cent ethyl alcohol added slowly with shaking until no more precipitate forms (about 40 cc. is necessary). The solution is allowed to cool and is decanted from the gummy salts; the solvent is then distilled from the sugar on the steam bath, finally under reduced pressure. The sugar is dissolved in a minimum volume of hot methyl alcohol, cooled, seeded with arabinose if necessary, set in the refrigerator to crystallize and the arabinose filtered off. If an appreciable amount of mother liquor is obtained, a fourth crop of crystals can be secured without again removing the gummy salts. In this way a total yield of 180\u2013230 g. of crude arabinose can be obtained from the gum. The first two crops of crystals are easily obtained and amount to approximately 90 per cent of the total yield. The melting point of the crude sugar varies from 147 to 152\u00b0.\nThe crude powdered sugar is purified by heating 200 g. of it for forty-five minutes on the boiling-water bath with 300 g. of glacial acetic acid,1 allowing to cool, filtering off the arabinose, washing it with 500 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in four portions, and drying at 50\u201360\u00b0. It then weighs about 182 g. and melts at 155\u2013157\u00b0. It may be recrystallized from five times its weight of 76 per cent ethyl alcohol, with the use of 10 g. of decolorizing charcoal (Norite). The yield is about 127 g., and the melting point is 155\u2013157\u00b0; the crystals are now perfectly colorless."

            "In a 5-l. two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a good mechanical stirrer (Note 1), a separatory funnel, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser connected with a trap (Note 2) for absorbing the hydrogen chloride evolved, are placed 455 g. (3.4 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 3) and 1 l. (10.2 moles) of dry carbon tetrachloride (Note 4). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath (Note 5). The stirrer is started and when the temperature of the carbon tetrachloride has dropped to 10\u201315\u00b0, 50 cc. of dry thiophene-free benzene (Note 6) is added all at once. The reaction begins immediately as is indicated by the evolution of hydrogen chloride and a rising temperature. As soon as the reaction has started, salt is added to the ice in the cooling bath in order to get more effective cooling. When the temperature begins to fall after the reaction has started, a mixture of 550 cc. (a total of 6.7 moles) of thiophene-free benzene and 550 cc. (a total of 14.5 moles) of carbon tetrachloride is run in at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 (Note 5). If efficient cooling is maintained, this addition requires one to two hours. The stirring is continued for about three hours after the benzene-carbon tetrachloride solution has been added, while the temperature is held at about 10\u00b0. The stirring is then discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand about twelve hours. During this time the mixture comes to room temperature.\nThe stirrer is then again started and about 500 cc. of water is slowly added. External cooling is used in order that the water may be added more rapidly. The excess carbon tetrachloride usually refluxes during this part of the procedure. The reaction mixture is then first heated on a steam bath to remove most of the excess of carbon tetrachloride, then the mixture is distilled with steam to carry over the remaining carbon tetrachloride (Note 7), and to hydrolyze the benzophenone dichloride to benzophenone. The carbon tetrachloride comes over in about thirty minutes but the steam distillation is continued for about one hour to insure complete hydrolysis. The upper benzophenone layer is then separated from the aqueous layer and the latter is extracted with about 200 cc. of benzene. The benzene solution and the benzophenone are transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) for distillation. The benzene and any water that is present are removed under ordinary pressure and the benzophenone is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 8). The yield is 490\u2013550 g. (80\u201389 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzene) of a product boiling at 187\u2013190\u00b0 /15 mm., and solidifying to a white solid melting at 47\u201348\u00b0. The material sometimes has a bluish tinge. This color may be removed and a colorless product obtained by moistening the material with benzene and centrifuging."

The resulting solution of sodium methoxide (Note 2) is cooled to \u2212 5\u00b0 in a freezing mixture. A solution of 50 g. (0.21 mole) of pure commercial benzoyl peroxide (m.p. 104\u00b0) (Note 3) in 200 cc. of chloroform (Note 4) is prepared, cooled to 0\u00b0, and added without delay to the sodium methoxide solution (Note 2) with shaking and cooling at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0\u00b0. The mixture is kept for four or five minutes in an ice-salt bath with continuous shaking; it turns milky, but no precipitate appears. The reaction mixture is now transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and the sodium perbenzoate is extracted with 500 cc. of water containing much chopped ice (Note 5). The chloroform layer is then separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-cc. portions of cold chloroform to remove the methyl benzoate. The aqueous solution contains the sodium salt of perbenzoic acid. The perbenzoic acid is liberated by the addition of 225 cc. of cold 1 N sulfuric acid and is removed from solution by extracting three times with 100-cc. portions of cold chloroform (Note 6). The united chloroform solutions are washed twice with 50-cc. portions of water, and the chloroform layer is carefully separated.\nThe volume of the moist (milky) chloroform solution is about 308 cc., and iodometric titration indicates that it contains 23.5\u201324.5 g. of perbenzoic acid (82.5\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 7), (Note 8), and (Note 9). Water is the only impurity present in the moist solution; the solution may therefore be used as such for oxidations that are to be carried out in the presence of water.\nTo obtain crystalline perbenzoic acid, the moist chloroform solution is dried with a small amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate for an hour (Note 6). Then the sodium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with dry chloroform; from the filtrate the chloroform is completely removed under reduced pressure while carbon dioxide is introduced through a capillary tube. The white or pale yellow residue is dried for several hours under 10 mm. pressure at 30\u201335\u00b0. The yield is 22\u201323 g. of crystalline mass which contains several per cent less active oxygen than the theoretical owing to a slight contamination with benzoic acid (Note 8) and (Note 9). The perbenzoic acid is very soluble in the usual organic solvents, such as chloroform, ether, ethyl acetate; it is slightly soluble in cold water and in cold ligroin."

            "A 1500-cc. flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a 200-cc. separatory funnel. In the flask are placed 372 g. (4 moles) of aniline (Note 1), 105 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium bicarbonate (Note 2), and 100 cc. of water. The flask and contents are then heated on a steam bath to 90\u201395\u00b0, and 127 g. (115 cc., 1 mole) of benzyl chloride (Note 3) is run in slowly from the separatory funnel, vigorous agitation being maintained. The addition of benzyl chloride should take not less than one and one-half to two hours, and the reaction is complete in four hours.\nThe mixture is then cooled, filtered with suction, the layers of water and organic liquid separated, and the latter washed with saturated salt solution (Note 4). The amines are then dried by shaking with about 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and again filtered with suction. The excess of aniline is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 5) using a modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm (p. 130). The aniline distils at 81\u00b0 /12 mm., and then the temperature rises quickly to the boiling point of benzylaniline, 180\u00b0 /12 mm. or 190\u00b0 /16 mm. When the temperature has risen to within about 5\u00b0 of the boiling point of the benzylaniline, the receiver is again changed and the benzylaniline collected from 170\u2013200\u00b0 /12 mm., practically all boiling at 178\u2013180\u00b0 /12 mm. (Note 6).\nThe aniline recovered amounts to 250\u2013260 g. (89\u201392 per cent of the theoretical amount), and the yield of benzylaniline is 155\u2013160 g. (85\u201387 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzyl chloride). The product solidifies on cooling and melts at 33\u201336\u00b0. It is practically colorless and sufficiently pure for most synthetic purposes. A pure compound melting at 36\u00b0 may be obtained by crystallizing the product from about 100 cc. of ligroin (b.p. 85\u201390\u00b0). The solution is cooled in a freezing mixture to cause crystallization, the crystals filtered with suction, washed with a little cold ligroin, pressed, and dried. The recovery is about 90 per cent of the original product."

        "Procedure": [
            "Forty-three grams (0.25 mole) of p-bromoaniline (Note 1) and 20 cc. of water are warmed in a 400-cc. beaker until the bromoaniline melts, and then 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added with mechanical stirring. The mixture is heated and stirred until solution is practically complete (Note 2). The beaker is then set in a dish of ice water and the solution is stirred as it cools in order to precipitate the p-bromoaniline hydrochloride in fine crystals. A few small pieces of ice are added, and the cold (about 0\u20135\u00b0) suspension is diazotized with a solution of 18 g. (0.26 mole) of sodium nitrite in 36 cc. of water to an end-point with starch-iodide paper.\nThe diazotized solution is poured into a 1.5-l. wide-mouthed flask or bottle which is surrounded by ice water. Three hundred cubic centimeters of cold benzene is now poured into the diazonium solution, and by means of a good stirrer the two liquids are intimately mixed. The mixture, which is at the temperature of melting benzene, is now ready for the addition of alkali.\nTo this well-stirred mixture is added 58 cc. of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution over a period of one-half to three-quarters of an hour. This may be added drop by drop from a separatory funnel or in portions of a few cubic centimeters. The addition of the alkali causes the formation of a yellow precipitate which, on being stirred into the benzene, reacts with the benzene and gives p-bromobiphenyl. If too much of this reactive \"oxide\" is precipitated at one time, some of it may decompose to a dark brown product. The alkali is, therefore, added at such a rate that the amount of precipitate is at no time greater than can readily react with the benzene, and the stirring must be efficient. The temperature during the reaction is kept at about 5\u00b0; when all the alkali has been added, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature.\nIf an emulsion has formed, it may be broken by acidifying with hydrochloric acid, whereupon two clear layers are obtained. The benzene solution may be dried and then fractionated or, preferably, it may be steam distilled. In the latter case it is transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, the flask is set in an oil bath (Note 3), and the benzene distilled. Steam is then passed in, and after the last of the benzene is removed, the p-bromobiphenyl distils with the steam. The temperature of the oil bath is held at 170\u00b0 in order to hasten the distillation. The product solidifies in the condenser and receiving flask. There is obtained 23\u201324 g. of p-bromobiphenyl which melts at 85\u201386.5\u00b0.\nThe crude product is usually yellow or orange in color. The color may be readily removed by dissolving the crude product in 200 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol and treating this solution with 5 g. of zinc dust and about 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This solution is then filtered and the p-bromobiphenyl allowed to crystallize. This gives a white product melting at 89.5\u201390\u00b0. The yield is 20\u201321 g. (34\u201335 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

(2.2 moles) of freshly distilled dry nitrobenzene (Note 2). The joints in the apparatus are made of asbestos paper covered with water glass (see Note 5, p. 19). The flask is heated in an oil bath maintained at 135\u2013145\u00b0, and 26 g. of iron powder and 562 g. (180 cc., 3.5 moles) of dry bromine (Note 3) are added in the following manner: Eight grams of iron powder (\"ferrum reductum\") (Note 4) is added through the side neck to the stirred nitrobenzene. From the separatory funnel 60 cc. of bromine is added at such a rate that the bromine vapors do not traverse the condenser. This addition requires about one hour, and the mixture is stirred and heated for another hour before the addition of a second portion of iron and bromine. Two portions, each of 8 g. of iron powder and 60 cc. of bromine, are added under the same conditions as the first addition, and the mixture is stirred and heated for one hour between the completion of one addition and the beginning of another. The evolution of hydrogen bromide slackens considerably toward the last of the heating, and there is practically no more bromine vapor in the condenser. A final addition of 2 g. of iron powder is made, and the heating continued for one hour longer.\nThe reaction product, which is a dark reddish-brown liquid, is poured or siphoned (Note 5) into 1.5 l. of water to which 50 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite has been added (Note 6). The mixture is distilled with steam (p. 479) and the first portion of the distillate is collected separately to remove a small amount of unchanged nitrobenzene. It is necessary to collect about 12 l. of distillate in order to obtain all the m-bromonitrobenzene. The yellow crystalline solid is filtered with suction and pressed well on the funnel to remove water and traces of nitrobenzene. The yield of crude product varies from 270 to 340 g. (60\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 51.5\u201352\u00b0 and boils at 117\u2013118\u00b0/9 mm. This product is satisfactory for most purposes. If a purer material is desired, the crude m-bromonitrobenzene may be distilled under reduced pressure. The recovery on purification is about 85 per cent. Br\u00fchl recorded the b.p. as 138\u00b0/18 mm. and the m.p. as 56\u00b0 for pure m-bromonitrobenzene.1"

            "In a tared Erlenmeyer flask surrounded by an ice-salt bath is placed 100 g. (119 cc., 1.78 moles) of acrolein (p. 15) (Note 1). When the temperature has dropped to \u221210 to \u221215\u00b0 a current of dry hydrogen chloride (p. 293) is passed into the acrolein until it shows a gain in weight of 65 g.(1.78 moles). This requires about two hours. The product thus obtained is a clear, viscous, slightly yellow liquid which becomes very turbid and dark colored on standing one or two days (Note 2).\nThe oxidation of the crude \u03b2-chloropropionaldehyde is carried out in a 200-cc. flask fitted with a cork stopper held about 2 cm. above the opening of the neck by means of a clamp. The stopper carries a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, a thermometer, and a glass delivery tube about 10 mm. in diameter which is connected to a water pump. The space between the stopper and the flask is closed by winding a strip of asbestos paper around it (Note 3).\nIn the flask is placed 64 g. (43 cc., 0.9 mole) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.49) (Note 4), the stirrer is started, and about one-sixth (Note 5) of the crude \u03b2-chloropropionaldehyde is added (Note 6) very slowly through the separatory funnel. About 1 cc. of the aldehyde is added to the acid. The temperature remains constant for one or two minutes and then slowly rises. As the oxidation begins, oxides of nitrogen are evolved and are drawn off by means of the water pump. When the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches about 30\u00b0 (Note 7), the flask is immersed in a water bath (at 15\u201320\u00b0) and the rate of addition of the aldehyde is regulated so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is 30\u201335\u00b0. After the addition of the last portion of the aldehyde, stirring is continued until the temperature drops below 25\u00b0. This oxidation requires about twenty-five minutes.\nThe products of six successive oxidations are combined in a 1-l. long-necked flask. Oxides of nitrogen are evolved but there is no danger of a violent reaction. The entire quantity of liquid is heated gradually on a water bath until the bath is boiling. This should be done under a hood as large quantities of oxides of nitrogen are evolved (Note 8). After about one and one-half hours the oxidation is complete and a yellow-brown liquid remains.\nThe liquid is placed in a modified Claisen flask (p. 130) and distilled (Note 9) from an oil bath with a water pump, care being taken to protect the manometer (placed in shunt in order to avoid the passage of a current of vapors) by a tube containing solid sodium hydroxide. A water condenser 40\u201350 cm. long should be used. At first oxides of nitrogen are evolved and it is difficult to obtain a low pressure. Then the pressure drops (to about 20\u201325 mm.) and nitric acid distils at 40\u201370\u00b0. When the distillation has nearly stopped, the temperature of the bath is raised until the boiling point of the distilling vapors reaches 100\u00b0. This fraction weighs 160\u2013170 g. and is nitric acid having a specific gravity of 1.25\u20131.30. It may contain a small amount of acrylic acid. The condenser is now removed from the apparatus, a distilling flask attached as receiver, and the residue is fractionated at 20 mm., collecting about 4\u20135 g. boiling up to 105\u00b0, and 116\u2013125 g. of \u03b2-chloropropionic acid boiling at 105\u2013107\u00b0 (60\u201365 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product melts at 35\u201340\u00b0 (purest acid melts at 42\u00b0). The fraction boiling below 105\u00b0 contains a large proportion of \u03b2-chloropropionic acid and should be redistilled with a subsequent run.",
            "A 3-l. long-necked Pyrex flask containing 880 g. (620 cc., 10 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is supported in an ice bath in a hood and supplied with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer suspended in the liquid. While the temperature is kept between 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 by means of the ice bath, 200 g. (2.12 moles) of trimethylene chlorohydrin (p. 533) is run in from a dropping funnel (Note 1). The addition takes two to three hours. Stirring is continued for a half hour longer.\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight and is then heated for one hour on the steam bath. It is transferred to a modified Claisen flask (p. 130), and the \u03b2-chloropropionic acid is isolated by distillation under reduced pressure, employing a water pump. Nitric acid is collected up to 100\u00b0/20 mm., using a water condenser (Note 2). The condenser is replaced by a distilling flask, and the residual material is fractionated. The yield of \u03b2-chloropropionic acid boiling at 107\u2013109\u00b0/20 mm. and freezing at 39\u00b0 is 179\u2013181 g. (78\u201379 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

After refluxing for five minutes (Note 4), 160 cc. of cold water is added, and the flask is cooled by ice water.

The addition should be slow until the violence of the reaction abates somewhat.\nThe mixture is then heated on a steam bath, gently at first (Note 4), and then at full heat for two hours. After cooling, it is filtered by suction. The mixture of the organic disulfide and the sodium chloride is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and stirred thoroughly with 500 cc. of water to remove the sodium chloride. It is then filtered by suction and the crystalline residue is washed on the filter with 100 cc. of alcohol to remove any o-chloronitrobenzene.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 12-l. earthenware crock equipped with an efficient stirrer and a strong motor are placed 375 g. (2.5 moles) of mandelic acid (p. 336) and 500 cc. of water. The stirrer is started, and a cool solution of 110 g. (2.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide (or 115 g. of technical sodium hydroxide) in 500 cc. of water is added. This is followed by the addition of 2000 g. of cracked ice and then after a few minutes by 275 g. (1.74 moles) of finely ground u.s.p. potassium permanganate in portions over a period of one-half hour. The mixture is stirred for one and one-half hours, the temperature being maintained at \u22122\u00b0 to \u22124\u00b0. About 5 kg. of ice is necessary. At the end of one and one-half hours the mixture is tested for excess permanganate by placing a drop on a piece of filter paper; a black or brown center of manganese dioxide is formed, a greenish ring around this, and an outer ring which is colorless in the absence and pink in the presence of excess permanganate. Any excess is removed by adding ethyl alcohol, generally about 200\u2013300 cc.\nWhen the permanganate has been destroyed, the stirrer is stopped and the manganese dioxide allowed to coagulate for one hour. The mixture is filtered through two 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnels; the filter cakes are washed with 1000 cc. of water (Note 1) and sucked dry again (Note 2). The filtrate is evaporated to 800\u20131000 cc. over a free flame. While the volume of solution is large, two 30-cm. evaporating dishes are used, but toward the end the two solutions are combined in one dish. The evaporation requires two to three hours. Sometimes a little manganese dioxide will be coagulated during the evaporation; this should be removed by filtration.\nThe yellowish solution is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flask and cooled with running water while 300 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly from a separatory funnel. This acidification process requires thirty minutes, during which time the temperature should not rise much above 25\u00b0. The liquid froths and about 30 g. of benzoic acid separates but it is not filtered. Extraction of the reaction mixture with 200-cc. portions of ether until 1500 cc. of extract has been collected is now carried out in a separatory funnel. The ether is distilled on a steam bath from a 1-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flask connected with a water condenser, the extract being added from a separatory funnel as fast as the ether distils. After most of the ether has been removed, the heating is continued for an additional one-half hour.\nThe crude liquid acid (about 300 g.) is cooled with running water, and 15 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added; the clear yellow oil becomes cloudy. The acid is esterified by passing the vapor of ethyl alcohol into the hot solution as in the preparation of ethyl fumarate in Org. Syn. 10, 48, or by the method described for ethyl cyanoacetate in Org. Syn. 3, 54, with the following changes: all three flasks, the alcohol flask, the trap, and the esterification flask are 1-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flasks. The alcohol flask and the trap are set on adjacent steam baths. The esterification flask is placed in an oil bath which is heated by a free flame. A safety tube leads from the alcohol flask and dips under 7.5 cm. of mercury contained in a side-arm tube. This mercury safety valve avoids all dangers which might result from the development of excess pressure within the system (Note 3). The temperature of the esterification mixture is kept at 105\u2013110\u00b0 and ethyl alcohol vapor is passed through until 500 cc. of distillate has been collected. This requires about three hours. The distillate consists of alcohol, water, and a little ether.\nThe crude ester is cooled, an equal volume of benzene is added, then the free acid is neutralized by shaking with about 250 cc. of a 10 per cent solution of sodium carbonate (Note 4). The benzene solution is poured into 1300 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite (about 60 g. of technical sodium bisulfite per 100 cc.), contained in a wide-necked bottle equipped with an efficient stirrer, and the mixture stirred for two and one-half hours. The mixture soon warms up a little and becomes semi-solid. It is filtered through a 20-cm. B\u00fcchner funnel and carefully washed, first with 200 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite, finally with two 150-cc. portions of benzene (Note 5) and (Note 6). The white pearly flakes of the sodium bisulfite addition product are transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and containing 700 cc. of water, 175 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 500 cc. of benzene. The flask is heated on a steam bath under a hood, the temperature being kept at 55\u00b0, and the mixture is stirred for thirty minutes (Note 7).\nThe solution is then poured into a separatory funnel, the benzene separated, and the water layer extracted with a 200-cc. portion of benzene. The combined benzene solution is shaken with excess of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution to remove free acid and sulfur dioxide (Note 8). The benzene is washed with a little water and then dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate (Note 9). The benzene is distilled at ordinary pressure over a free flame from a 500-cc. Claisen flask, the solution being added from a separatory funnel as fast as the benzene distils. It is advisable to distil the ester under reduced pressure although it can be done under ordinary pressure. The fraction distilling around 118\u00b0/5 mm., 130\u00b0/10 mm., 138\u00b0/15 mm., 148\u00b0/25 mm., 155\u00b035 mm., or 254\u00b0/760 mm. is collected. The yield of ethyl benzoylformate is 155\u2013175 g. (35\u201340 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 10) and (Note 11)."

            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 500 g. (5.3 moles) of chloroacetic acid is dissolved in 700 cc. of water. The solution is warmed to 50\u00b0 and neutralized with anhydrous sodium carbonate of which about 290 g. (2.7 moles) is required (a slight excess of sodium carbonate is not disadvantageous). Meanwhile 294 g. (5.8 moles) of sodium cyanide (97 per cent) is dissolved in 750 cc. of water warmed to 55\u00b0. The sodium cyanide solution is then added to the sodium chloroacetate solution, which has been cooled to room temperature, with rapid mixing of the two solutions and cooling under the water tap. The temperature rapidly rises; when it reaches 95\u00b0 the solution should be cooled by adding 200 cc. of cold water and this repeated, if necessary, until the temperature no longer rises (Note 1). The solution is heated to the boiling point and boiled for five minutes (Note 2), and finally cooled with running water for one-half hour.\nThe solution is filtered if not clear, and the cyanoacetic acid is set free (Hood) by adding with thorough stirring 694 g. (600 cc., 5.8 moles) (a slight excess) of commercial hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.156). The solution is evaporated on a water bath at 60\u201370\u00b0 (Note 3) under a pressure of 20\u201330 mm. and the evaporation continued until practically no more distillate (Note 4) comes over. To the residue is added 600 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. The solution is filtered (Note 5) from the sodium chloride, and the residue is washed with another 500-cc. portion of alcohol.\nOn evaporating the alcoholic solution under reduced pressure from a water bath held at 50\u201360\u00b0 (Note 6) the residue weighs about 540 g. A mixture of 600 cc. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) and 10 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 7) is then added. The mixture is then heated on the water bath under a reflux condenser for three hours. The excess of alcohol and some of the water formed are removed by distillation under reduced pressure and the residue again heated for two hours with 300 cc. of absolute alcohol and an additional 4 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The alcohol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and when the ester has cooled to room temperature, the sulfuric acid is neutralized with a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate; the ester (upper layer) is separated, and the aqueous solution extracted with ether, or preferably benzene; about one-tenth of the yield is in the extract. The combined products are placed in a 1-l. distilling flask and distilled under reduced pressure after the solvent and alcohol and water have been removed. The ester is collected at 94\u201399\u00b0, chiefly at 97\u201398\u00b0/16 mm. (Note 8). The yield of a product analyzing about 97\u201398 per cent ethyl cyanoacetate amounts to 474\u2013492 g.

            "In a 4-l. beaker is placed 210 g. (1.5 moles) of finely powdered m-nitroaniline (Note 1). A cold mixture of 450 cc. of water and 330 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added with hand or mechanical stirring, and then about 800 g. of finely crushed ice. When a homogeneous mixture has resulted, a solution of 105 g. (1.52 moles) of sodium nitrite in 250 cc. of water is added rapidly over a period of eight to ten minutes at the bottom of the mixture through a separatory funnel (Note 2) until a permanent color is given to starch-iodide paper (about 25\u201330 cc. of nitrite solution remains unused). The temperature during diazotization should be maintained at 0\u20135\u00b0. Stirring is continued for five to ten minutes longer, and the solution allowed to settle for another five minutes. A heavy crystalline deposit of m-nitrobenzenediazonium sulfate settles at the bottom of the beaker, from which the supernatant liquid is decanted (Note 3).\nWhile the diazotization is in progress, 1 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to 750 cc. of water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask and the mixture heated to boiling (160\u00b0) with a large ring burner. The liquor from the diazotization is then added from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the acid mixture boils very vigorously. About fifty minutes is required for this addition. The crystalline diazonium sulfate is then added in small portions at such a rate that the evolved nitrogen does not cause loss of material by excessive foaming. Boiling is continued for a few minutes longer, and the contents of the flask are poured into a large beaker (Note 4) set in running cold water, and vigorously stirred to obtain a homogeneous crystal magma.\nWhen completely cold, the nitrophenol is filtered, thoroughly pressed out, drained with suction, and washed with several portions of iced water, 450 cc. in all being used. It is spread on large sheets of filter paper and dried in a warm room. As thus prepared it has a yellowish brown appearance with darker particles intermixed. The yield is 170\u2013180 g. (81\u201386 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5).\nIt may be purified by recrystallization from hot hydrochloric acid, as recommended in Org. Syn. 3, 89, but on account of the difficulty of filtration this procedure is satisfactory on a small scale only. It is preferably distilled in 200-g. lots from a 500-cc. Claisen flask under 10\u201315 mm. pressure, b.p. 160\u2013165\u00b0/12 mm. It is important that no air inlet be used to prevent bumping, since under these conditions the nitrophenol partly sublimes and causes trouble by stopping up the connections. A filter or distilling flask is used as a receiver, and only a short but wide-bore (10-mm.) air condenser is necessary (Note 6). The product is pale yellow and melts at 95\u201396\u00b0. The yield from 200 g. of crude product is 180\u2013185 g."

(1 mole) of dry powdered cinnamic acid, 2 g. of hydroquinone, and several small pieces of clay plate. One-half gram of hydroquinone is also placed in the flask in which the distillate is to be collected (Note 3). The acid is rapidly heated over a wire gauze with a free flame until phenylethylene begins to distil, the heating being regulated so that the temperature of the vapors at the head of the column never exceeds 130\u00b0, and mainly remains below 120\u00b0 (Note 4) and (Note 2). The cinnamic acid refluxes, but very little should escape and collect in the condenser. The decomposition is complete in three and one-half to five hours, when no more phenylethylene distils and the temperature at the head of the column rises rapidly.\nThe distillate consists of a straw-colored oil and a little water; a dark tarry residue (50\u201360 g.) remains in the reaction flask. About 100 cc. of water is added to the distillate, and the aqueous mixture is distilled. The phenylethylene is easily volatile with steam and separates in the distillate as a colorless oil. The oil (45\u201348 g.) is separated, dried with a small amount of calcium chloride, and carefully distilled under reduced pressure, the condenser and receiver being cooled to 0\u20135\u00b0 by means of iced (or very cold) water. The phenylethylene is collected at 44\u201346\u00b0/40 mm. or 60\u201363\u00b0/60 mm. (Note 5). The yield is 40\u201342 g. (38\u201341 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 6)."

            "(A) Esterification of \u03b1-Cyano-\u03b2-phenylacrylic Acid.\u2014In a 200-cc. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, 50 g. (0.29 mole) of dry \u03b1-cyano-\u03b2-phenylacrylic acid (p. 181) is boiled for four and one-half hours with 100 cc. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) containing 3\u20134 g. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride (p. 293). The resulting solution is filtered rapidly while hot and allowed to stand overnight. Long, flat, colorless prisms separate which are filtered off with suction, washed with a little cold alcohol, and dried in air. A further small quantity may be obtained by working up the mother liquor. The melting point of the ethyl \u03b1-cyano-\u03b2-phenylacrylate is 50\u00b0, and the yield is 46.5\u201353 g. (80\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 1).\n(B) Addition of Sodium Cyanide to Ethyl \u03b1-Cyano-\u03b2-phenylacrylate.\u2014Twenty grams (0.1 mole) of cyanophenylacrylic ester is treated with 40 cc. of 50 per cent alcohol and 10 g. (0.2 mole) of finely powdered sodium cyanide. The mixture becomes warm and the ester rapidly dissolves, the reaction being completed by heating on the steam bath for two minutes. To this is added 200 cc. of water, and the resulting clear, colorless solution of the addition product is decomposed with hydrochloric acid. This causes the precipitation of ethyl \u03b1,\u03b2-dicyano-\u03b2-phenylpropionate as a yellowish oil, which on standing overnight and being stirred vigorously, or seeded if possible, sets to a yellowish solid mass. This is filtered off with suction and washed with cold water.\n(C) Hydrolysis of Ethyl \u03b1,\u03b2-Dicyano-\u03b2-phenylpropionate.\u2014The product thus obtained is hydrolyzed by boiling under a reflux condenser for four hours with 80 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The substance goes into solution, and this clear solution, on cooling, deposits phenylsuccinic acid in small crystals which are nearly colorless. These are filtered off, washed with cold water, and dried. The yield of product melting at 164\u2013166\u00b0 is 17.6\u201318.4 g. (91\u201395 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the weight of ester used) (Note 2) and (Note 3)."

        "Procedure": [
            "In a porcelain casserole (a Pyrex beaker may be used) is prepared a solution of 3.5 g. (Note 1) of a commercial c.p. chloroplatinic acid (Note 2) and (Note 3) in 10 cc. of water, and to this is added 35 g. of c.p. sodium nitrate (Note 4). The mixture is evaporated to dryness by heating gently over a Bunsen flame while stirring with a glass rod. The temperature is then raised, 350\u2013370\u00b0 being reached within about ten minutes. Fusion takes place, brown oxides of nitrogen are evolved, and a precipitate of brown platinum oxide gradually separates. During this procedure foaming often occurs, in which case the mass must be more vigorously stirred and an additional flame directed at the top of the reaction mixture. If the burner under the casserole is removed when foaming starts, the top of the fused mass solidifies and foaming may become sufficient to carry material over the sides of the casserole. By the end of fifteen minutes, when the temperature has reached about 400\u00b0, the evolution of gas has greatly decreased. At the end of twenty minutes the temperature should be 500\u2013550\u00b0. At this point the vigorous evolution of oxides of nitrogen has practically ceased, and a gentle evolution of gas takes place. The temperature is held at this point (best with the full force of the burner directly on the casserole) until about thirty minutes have elapsed, when the fusion should be complete. This temperature (500\u2013550\u00b0) is most satisfactory for the fusion (Note 5) in order to obtain a catalyst of maximum activity and minimum lag (Note 6). The temperature indicated is generally attained by means of one ordinary Bunsen burner turned on as high as possible; where the gas pressure is lower a Meker burner may be necessary.\nThe mass is allowed to cool and is then treated with 50 cc. of water. The brown precipitate settles to the bottom and can be washed by decantation once or twice, then filtered (preferably through a hardened filter paper on a Gooch crucible), and washed on the filter until practically free from nitrates. If the fusion has been properly carried out no difficulty is encountered in this procedure; but if the temperature of fusion has not been high enough or has not been maintained for a sufficiently long time the precipitate tends to become colloidal on addition of water and does not filter well; moreover, under these conditions, the yield of product and its activity as a catalyst are diminished. Sometimes the precipitate becomes colloidal only when practically all the nitrates are removed; in this case it is better to stop washing as soon as the colloid starts to form, since small traces of the salt do not affect the efficiency of the catalyst. The filtrates should be tested for platinum and saved if any is present (Note 7). The oxide is either used directly, or more generally it is dried in a desiccator and portions of the dried material weighed out for reductions. The yield is 1.57\u20131.65 g. (95\u2013100 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5) and (Note 8). The use of platinum oxide is illustrated in the reduction of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate to ethyl p-aminobenzoate (p. 240) and of benzalacetophenone to benzylacetophenone (p. 101).\nThe platinum black by reduction of the oxide may sometimes be used a second, third, or even more times in the reduction of certain compounds merely by reactivating (Note 9) with air or oxygen. A spent catalyst must be reworked (Note 3) along with the platinum recovered from filtrates (Note 7), filter papers (Note 10) and the casserole (Note 11). In the use of platinum oxide-platinum black for reductions, certain types of compounds require different physical conditions from others in order to obtain the best results in each case, and factors such as the following must be taken into consideration: the temperature, the medium in which the reduction of platinum oxide to platinum black occurs (Note 12), the effect of traces of inorganic salts (Note 13), and the solvent employed (Note 14). Palladous oxide-palladium black has been used for catalytic reduction, and in some cases has proved a more efficient catalyst than the platinum oxide-platinum black, though generally this has not been found true (Note 15)."

(0.75 mole) of chloroacetamide (p. 153). The mixture is heated on a water bath to 90\u2013100\u00b0, and a steady evolution of carbon dioxide occurs. At the end of two hours, when gas evolution has practically ceased, the mixture is cooled to 40\u00b0, stirred vigorously, and 150 cc. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid poured in rapidly. p-Arsonophenylglycinamide crystallizes at once and, after cooling to room temperature, is filtered by suction and washed once with 2 per cent hydrochloric acid (Note 1), then with cold water.\nThe crude product thus obtained is contaminated with some arsanilic acid and possibly other products. These are removed during purification. The crude product is suspended in about 400 cc. of water, and, with vigorous stirring, treated carefully with 25 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide until solution is just complete. At this point the mixture is still acid to litmus, and an excess of sodium hydroxide is to be avoided to prevent decomposition of the product. About 15 g. of animal charcoal is added, the mixture stirred for five minutes without heating, and filtered. The filtrate is treated during vigorous stirring with 100 cc. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid, and the pure acid at once separates. After cooling, it is filtered by suction and washed thoroughly with small portions of ice-cold water until the filtrate is practically halogen-free (Note 2).\nThe acid, without drying, is suspended in about 200 cc. of distilled water and, with vigorous stirring, cautiously (Note 3) treated with 25 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until dissolved and the solution reacts neutral to litmus. The solution is then filtered through folded filter paper which should be free from soluble calcium salts, otherwise the filtrate will remain clouded by a suspension of the calcium salt. The clear, faintly yellow or colorless filtrate is then vigorously stirred and treated with 1.5 volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. Crystallization is induced by rubbing with a rod, and then an additional volume of alcohol is added. The mixture should be allowed to cool to about 20\u00b0 and stand for at least two hours to complete the precipitation of the salt, which is then filtered by suction and washed thoroughly with 85 per cent alcohol.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and mercury seal, a 500-cc. separatory funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser, is placed 61 g. (2.5 atoms) of magnesium turnings or powder (Note 1). The magnesium is then covered with 200 cc. of anhydrous ether. About 5 cc. of pure tert.-butyl chloride (with a crystal or two of iodine) is added to start the reaction. Stirring is begun, and a solution of 227 g. (2.5 moles) of pure tert.-butyl chloride (p. 144) in 1100 cc. of anhydrous ether is dropped slowly (Note 2) on the magnesium during six to eight hours. The reaction is practically complete when all the halide has been added, but stirring should be continued for fifteen minutes longer.\nThe reaction mixture is now surrounded by an ice and salt mixture. The separatory funnel is replaced by a two-holed rubber stopper containing a thermometer (bulb immersed in the reaction mixture) and a glass tube the outer end of which is connected to a mercury trap (Note 3). When the temperature of the reaction mixture has fallen to 0\u00b0, the condenser is replaced by a tube 10 mm. in diameter and adjusted so the end is 50 mm. above the surface of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is stirred and carbon dioxide is added through this tube directly from a cylinder after passing through two bottles containing concentrated sulfuric acid. The carbon dioxide is added as rapidly as it is used up. The temperature is controlled by the rate of stirring and should not go above 8+\u00b0. After two and one-half to three hours the temperature falls below 0\u00b0. Then the addition is continued for one-half hour under an excess pressure of 45 mm. (Note 3). The temperature falls to \u22123 to \u22125\u00b0 at the end of this time, and the reaction is complete.\nAfter the flask is surrounded with ice, the reaction mixture is hydrolyzed (Note 4) with 25 per cent sulfuric acid, transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and then the ether layer is separated (Note 4). The water layer is extracted with four 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are then washed with four 100-cc. portions of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to remove the trimethylacetic acid from the ether.\nThe aqueous alkaline extract is heated to 100\u00b0 to remove ether and volatile impurities. The solution is then cooled with ice and acidified with 25 per cent sulfuric acid, and the organic acid separated. The water layer is distilled from a 2-l. flask until no more oily solution comes over. The distillate is saturated with salt, and the acid layer is separated. This water layer together with the low-boiling fraction from distillation of the crude trimethylacetic acid is distilled and the distillate salted out as before.\nThe combined acid layers are distilled from a 250-cc. Claisen flask connected to an air condenser, which in turn is connected to a side-arm flask cooled by running water. The trimethylacetic acid is collected at 162\u2013165\u00b0/atm. press., 110\u2013112\u00b0/124 mm. The yield, which depends somewhat on the form of magnesium, is 157\u2013162 g. (61\u201363 per cent of the theoretical amount based on tert.-butyl chloride) when ordinary magnesium turnings are used and 177\u2013178 g. (69\u201370 per cent) when 200-mesh magnesium powder is used. The acid melts at 34\u201335\u00b0.",
            "In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer is placed a solution of 330 g. (8.25 moles) of u.s.p. stick sodium hydroxide in 2.8 l. of water, and the solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath. To the well-stirred solution 480 g. (154 cc., 3 moles) of bromine is added from a separatory funnel at such a rate as to keep the temperature below 10\u00b0 (Note 1) (fifteen to twenty minutes). The solution is cooled again to 0\u00b0, and 100 g. (1 mole) of pinacolone (p. 462) is added from a separatory funnel, the temperature being kept below 10\u00b0. After the solution is decolorized (about one hour) it is stirred for three hours at room temperature.\nThe flask is then fitted with a separatory funnel and a condenser for distillation, and heated with a Meker burner to steam-distil the bromoform and carbon tetrabromide (Note 2) and (Note 3).\nThe burner is then removed, the mixture is cooled to 50\u00b0, and 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 4) is added through the separatory funnel. The heat of neutralization causes some trimethylacetic acid to distil with water. When all the acid is added the flask is heated again and the trimethylacetic acid comes over with about 400 cc. of water. When all the trimethylacetic acid (70\u201380 cc.) has distilled, a liquid heavier than water begins to come over. The distillation is stopped and the acid separated from the water in a separatory funnel and dried either with calcium chloride or by distilling with benzene which carries over all water (Note 5). The trimethylacetic acid is further purified by distillation under reduced pressure. It boils at 75\u201378\u00b0/20 mm.; melts at 34\u201335\u00b0; and the yield is 63\u201365 g.\nThe water layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are dried with calcium chloride, the ether distilled, and the residue fractionated under reduced pressure, using a modified Claisen flask (p. 130). Ten to twelve grams may be obtained in this way. The total yield is 72\u201375 g. (71\u201374 per cent of the theoretical amount)."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 100-cc. round-bottomed, wide-mouthed flask (or a large test tube 18 cm. long and 4.5 cm. wide) is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a separatory funnel, a thermometer, an inlet tube reaching almost to the bottom of the flask, and an outlet tube leading to a condenser set for downward distillation. A receiver consisting of a suction flask is attached tightly to the end of the condenser, and the side arm of the receiver is attached to a reflux condenser. A tube is led from the top of the condenser to the hood in order to take care of excess hydrogen chloride during the distillation, or a gas-absorption trap (Fig. 7, p. 97) can be used for this purpose. About 25\u201330 cc. of trimethylene glycol (b.p. 210\u2013215\u00b0) is placed in the flask and heated by means of an oil or metal bath to 150\u2013170\u00b0. A very rapid stream of dry hydrogen chloride (Note 1) is now led into the hot glycol through the inlet tube. A reddish distillate consisting of water, trimethylene chlorohydrin, hydrogen chloride, and some unchanged glycol begins to distil. As rapidly as the glycol is used up in the reaction flask, more is added from the separatory funnel. It is always advisable to keep the amount of material in the reaction flask as small as possible. The rate at which the hydrogen chloride is passed through the flask controls the reaction and also has a marked effect on the yield (Note 2). The best results are obtained by passing in the gas rapidly enough to use up 2\u20133 cc. of trimethylene glycol in one minute. The process is continuous and can be run indefinitely without changing the apparatus. The weight of crude distillate from 1800 g. of trimethylene glycol is usually 2300\u20132500 g.\nTo obtain the trimethylene chlorohydrin, the distillate from this operation is heated for about one hour on a steam bath in order to drive out most of the excess hydrogen chloride. The distillate is then fractionated under reduced pressure (Note 3) in a modified Claisen flask (p. 130). The fractionating side arm should be 25 cm. in length. The fractions collected under 10 mm. are: to 55\u00b0, 55\u201357\u00b0, 57\u201365\u00b0, 65\u201385\u00b0, 85\u2013105\u00b0, residue.\nBefore a further fractionation is carried out, the residue is discarded; the portion boiling at 85\u2013105\u00b0, consisting chiefly of unchanged trimethylene glycol, is set aside for use in a later preparation; the low-boiling portion up to 55\u00b0, consisting mainly of water and hydrogen chloride with some trimethylene chloride (Note 4) and trimethylene chlorohydrin, is neutralized carefully with powdered sodium carbonate. Two layers form, and the upper containing the chlorohydrin is separated, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and again replaced as the portion boiling up to 55\u00b0. Another complete fractional distillation, carried out in the usual way, is now made except that the highest fraction boils at 65\u201385\u00b0/10 mm.\nThe material boiling above 65\u00b0/10 mm. is chiefly trimethylene glycol and is used in a succeeding experiment. The final yield of trimethylene chlorohydrin (Note 5) boiling at 60\u201364\u00b0/10 mm. is 835\u20131000 g. from 1800 g. of trimethylene glycol (50\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount), and 400\u2013450 g. of trimethylene glycol is recovered."

            "In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a very efficient mechanical stirrer, a 100-cc. separatory funnel, and a large air-cooled reflux condenser (Note 1), the upper part of which is bent downwards and attached to a vertical water condenser, are placed 176 g. (1.04 moles) of ground diphenylamine (Note 2), 204 g. (1 mole) of iodobenzene, 1 l. of nitrobenzene (Note 3), 138 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 5 g. of copper powder (Note 4).\nThe reaction mixture is then stirred very vigorously and boiled at such a rate that the nitrobenzene condenses in the upper third of the air-cooled reflux condenser and flows back in an almost steady stream. The water formed in the reaction passes over, together with a small amount of nitrobenzene and iodobenzene, and is condensed by the water-cooled condenser. This distillate is freed of water by shaking with a small quantity of sodium sulfate and returned at intervals through the separatory funnel to the reaction flask. Heating is continued for about twenty-four hours or until the reaction is complete, as is evidenced by the non-evolution of water (Note 5).\nThe reaction mixture is allowed to cool somewhat and is then transferred to a 5-l. flask, and the nitrobenzene together with a little of the excess diphenylamine is removed by steam distillation. During distillation the flask should be heated to prevent excessive condensation of steam (Note 6). Steam distillation should be continued until a liter of distillate contains less than 5 cc. of water-insoluble material (Note 7).\nThe reaction mixture is cooled, and the crude amines which separate are collected on a suction funnel and washed twice with 400-cc. portions of water. The filtrate and washings should be saved for the recovery of iodine (Note 8). The precipitate on the funnel is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, dissolved in about 1 l. of benzene, filtered, and the benzene-insoluble part washed three times with 75-cc. portions of benzene. The benzene solution and washings are combined and separated mechanically from as much water as possible. The water is then completely removed by distilling until the distillate comes over clear. If necessary, dry benzene is added to the solution in order to have a final volume of about 1200 cc.\nWhen the water is entirely removed, the benzene solution is cooled and an excess of dry hydrogen chloride is passed into it to precipitate the diphenylamine as the hydrochloride (Note 9).\nAfter standing about three hours, the diphenylamine hydrochloride is filtered and washed with benzene (Note 10). The benzene is distilled from the filtrate (Note 11), and the residual triphenylamine is transferred to a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) and distilled under reduced pressure. The first fraction consists of some benzene, then the temperature rises rapidly and a few cubic centimeters of deeply colored distillate come over just before the amine fraction, which is collected at 195\u2013205\u00b0/10\u201312 mm. The distillate is a yellow liquid which soon solidifies to a light yellow solid. The side arm of the distilling flask should be of rather large bore (about 10 mm.) to prevent clogging by the amine which solidifies. The crude product weighs 220\u2013235 g. and melts at 120\u2013124\u00b0.\nIn order to obtain a pure product the amine is dissolved in about 700 cc. of boiling ethyl acetate under a reflux condenser. When the amine has dissolved the solution is rapidly cooled and stirred, whereupon the amine separates in almost white crystals. Further crops of crystals may be obtained on concentrating the solution and cooling. The last portions may be colored, but one recrystallization from ethyl acetate gives a nearly colorless product (Note 12). The total yield of pale yellow product which melts at 126\u00b0 is 200\u2013210 g. (82\u201385 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 13)."

One hundred and eighty grams (3.4 moles) of ammonium chloride dissolved in 550 cc. of water is then added, followed by an ice-cold solution of 150 g. (3.1 moles) of sodium cyanide in 400 cc. of water. The sodium cyanide must be added slowly and with frequent cooling to prevent loss of acetaldehyde by volatilization.\nAfter the sodium cyanide solution is added, the bottle is stoppered securely, placed in a mechanical shaker, and shaken for four hours at room temperature. At the end of this time the solution is transferred to a 3-l. distilling flask and 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added (Hood) (Note 3).\nThe solution in the flask is distilled over a free flame until separation of salt prevents further heating. It is then transferred to a large evaporating dish, placed on a steam bath and evaporated to dryness (Note 4).\nThe residue remaining in the dish after evaporation is stirred thoroughly with 800 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. After filtration the alcohol is distilled on a steam bath and the last traces are removed under vacuum. While still warm the residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol containing 2 per cent of hydrochloric acid, and cooled. Two hundred cubic centimeters of ether is added, and the solution is filtered. This treatment should remove all but the last traces of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. The alcohol and ether are removed by distillation and the last of the free hydrochloric acid is removed by distillation under diminished pressure.\nThe alanine hydrochloride remaining in the flask is dissolved in 1500 cc. of water, and transferred to a metal pail of about 2-l. capacity. Two hundred and twenty grams of yellow lead oxide is added and the mixture is boiled gently for one hour. During the boiling small amounts of water are added at intervals in order to maintain the original volume (Note 5). Upon cooling, the lead chloride crystallizes; it is filtered off and the solution is again boiled one hour with 100 g. of lead oxide. Twenty grams of freshly precipitated lead hydroxide is added slowly and the boiling is continued for ten minutes. Following this the solution is again cooled and filtered (Note 6). The chloride content should now be equivalent to not more than 50\u201375 cc. of a normal solution (Note 7).\nThe solution is again brought to a boil and the calculated amount of silver oxide (Note 7) is added to remove the last of the chlorides. The silver chloride is filtered off and the lead is precipitated with hydrogen sulfide. After filtering off the lead sulfide, a light strawcolored solution remains.\nThe solution is evaporated by boiling to a volume of about 400 cc., and 600 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is added. When thoroughly cooled, 100\u2013120 g. of alanine is filtered off. This is washed with 200 cc. of alcohol and a pure white product is obtained.\nA further crop of 40\u201350 g. may be obtained by removing the alcohol and water until a volume of about 100 cc. remains, and then adding 250 cc. of alcohol and cooling to 0\u00b0. The total yield is 140\u2013160 g. (52\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8).\nAlanine so prepared is sufficiently pure for most purposes.

(44.5 moles, 2700 g.) of cold (1\u20134\u00b0) concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) (Note 2) in a 1-gal. glass-stoppered bottle, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for at least four days (Note 3). The solution is concentrated to a volume of 300 cc. (Note 4), filtered, and concentrated further to 200 cc. The solution is cooled to room temperature and 1 l. of methyl alcohol (Note 5) added. After chilling overnight in a refrigerator (0\u20134\u00b0) the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with 250 cc. each of methyl alcohol and ether (Note 6). The yield is 42\u201348 g. of crude alanine.\nFor purification the crude product is dissolved in 200 cc. of water (warming if necessary), 1 l. of methyl alcohol is added, and the mixture chilled overnight. After washing as before, the yield is about 38\u201342 g. (65\u201370 per cent of the theoretical amount) of purified dl-alanine, m. p. 295\u00b0 (dec.) on the Maquenne block (Note 7). This product is free of bromide and contains only traces of ammonia. If an especially pure product is desired the material may be reprecipitated from methyl alcohol once more in the same manner (Note 8)."

(0.145 mole) of solid sodium nitrite in small portions. The addition is made at such a rate that only a very small amount of nitrogen oxide is evolved. When solution is complete, 20 g. (0.145 mole) of salicylic acid is added in small portions with stirring; about fifteen minutes is required. The mixture is stirred at 20\u00b0 until all the solid is in solution (Note 2).

The reaction is complete a few minutes after all the formaldehyde has been added. About 100 g. of finely crushed ice is then added, followed by 500 cc. of ice water; the stirring should be vigorous during the addition (Note 4). The contents of the flask are stirred until the aurin tricarboxylic acid has disintegrated into small pieces.\nThe solid is washed several times by decantation, using cold water, and finally filtered with suction. It is then dissolved in dilute ammonia (1 volume of concentrated ammonia with 2 volumes of water) while it is still on the filter paper in the suction funnel (Note 5). The filtrate is evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The resulting glassy, light yellowish-brown ammonium salt, which weighs 19\u201322 g.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 5-l., two-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient reflux condenser (Note 1), is placed a mixture of 130 g. (131 cc., 1.64 moles) of dry pyridine (Note 2) and 3 l. of absolute alcohol (see Note 2 on p. 249). During the course of forty to fifty minutes 450 g. (19.6 atoms) of sodium is added gradually. The sodium is added in as large pieces as can be inserted through the second opening in the flask. One and one-half liters of absolute alcohol is now added and the mixture heated over an oil bath for two to three hours until the sodium disappears. It is desirable not to allow the reaction mixture to cool (Note 3) at this point but to separate the piperidine immediately. The condenser is set for distillation and a separatory funnel is inserted through the stopper in the second opening of the flask. The alcohol is then distilled using an oil bath (Note 4). The addition of a piece of zinc facilitates an even distillation. During this procedure, water to the amount of 1700\u20131800 cc. is added to the reaction mixture through the separatory funnel, slowly at first and later as rapidly as possible. At the beginning, this addition must be very cautious as the heat evolved causes a very distillation of alcohol. After about 200 cc. of water has been added, the mixture begins to solidify and remains semi-solid until most of the water has been added. The distillation is continued until practically all the alcohol has distilled (three to four hours). At the end of this time there remains in the distilling flask about 1500 cc. of residue, which is discarded. The distillate is about 5 l. in volume. To this is added 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and the mixture is then returned to the distilling flask. The alcohol is removed by distillation on a steam bath until the residual volume in the flask amounts to about 600\u2013800 cc.; this requires two to three hours.\nThe residue is then transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and separatory funnel. The mixture is treated with stirring with a solution of 186 g. of technical sodium hydroxide or 170 g. (4.25 moles) of c.p. sodium hydroxide in about 300 cc. of water. With continuous stirring 235 g. (1.67 moles) of benzoyl chloride is now added during the course of one hour, keeping the temperature down by cooling with running water. After the addition, the reaction mixture is cooled, the amide separated (Note 5), washed with a little water (Note 6) and distilled (Note 7) under reduced pressure. The product boils at 180\u2013184\u00b0 /20 mm., 191\u2013194\u00b0 /27 mm., 240\u2013244\u00b0 /130 mm., and weighs 240\u2013250 g. (77\u201381 per cent of the theoretical amount).\nBenzoyl piperidine thus obtained is a straw-colored viscous liquid. Upon long standing or seeding with crystalline benzoyl piperidine, the compound crystallizes in long, colorless needles which melt at 44\u00b0. The literature reports 48\u00b0 as the melting point of the pure material.\nUsing 180 g. of pyridine in place of the 130 g. suggested, and a corresponding increase in the other chemicals except the sodium and alcohol, a yield of 300\u2013326 g. of benzoyl piperidine is obtained. This is a smaller percentage yield (70\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount) but the actual yield more than repays for the excess of pyridine used (Note 8)."

At this point the stirrer is started and the sodium is broken up into very small particles (Note 4). The oil bath is removed, but stirring is continued until the sodium has solidified in very fine particles. The xylene is then poured off, and to the sodium is added 460 cc. (4.7 moles) of absolute ethyl acetate (Note 5) containing 3\u20134 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol (Note 6). The flask is quickly cooled to 0\u00b0 and 106 g.

About one and one-half to two hours are required for this addition. The stirring is continued until practically all of the sodium has reacted (one hour after all the aldehyde has been added).\nWhen most of the sodium (Note 9) has disappeared, 90\u201395 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added and the mixture is carefully diluted with water.

            "(A) Apparatus.\u2014The reduction is carried out in an 18 by 25 cm. battery jar (Note 1) which is surrounded by a vessel of cold water. The bottom of the battery jar is just covered with mercury which serves as the cathode of the cell. The anode is a coil of heavy sheet lead separated from the catholyte by suspending it in a porous cup. The latter is supported in the battery jar so that it just clears the surface of the mercury (Note 2). The cathode is connected with the circuit by means of a copper wire well insulated with rubber except for one-eighth inch at the end which is immersed in the mercury. Efficient mechanical stirring is provided for the catholyte. The current used for these experiments was drawn from a storage battery delivering 30 volts, through a rheostat and ammeter each capable of carrying 15 amperes. Current may be taken from any source which will supply 80 to 85 ampere-hours at the rate of 5 to 10 amperes. Several reduction cells of the size described may be run at one time by connecting them in series. The diagram given on p. 486 shows the arrangement of the apparatus.\n(B) Reduction of Cinnamic Acid.\u2014After the apparatus is assembled, 2 l. of 7\u20138 per cent sodium sulfate solution (Note 3) is placed in the battery jar and the porous cup is filled to the same level with more of this solution. The stirrer is started, and 200 g. (1.35 moles) of a good grade of cinnamic acid (Note 4) is suspended in the catholyte. A solution of 35 g. (0.88 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 150 cc. of water is then added at such a rate as to avoid forming lumps of sodium cinnamate (Note 5). The current is turned on and the rheostat adjusted until a steady current of 5 to 10 amperes is flowing (Note 6). From this point only occasional attention is required. The suspended sodium cinnamate and cinnamic acid gradually dissolve as the reduction proceeds. Portions adhering to the walls of the cell should be worked down with a stirring rod and finally with a little water from a wash bottle. The liquor inside the porous cup should be kept alkaline by adding very concentrated sodium hydroxide solution at about one-half hour intervals (Note 5). About 110 g. (2.7 moles) will be required. The reduction will require 76 to 80 ampere-hours (Note 7); considerable hydrogen is evolved near the end. The temperature need not be controlled (Note 8).\nWhen reduction is complete (Note 7) the cathode liquor is decanted or siphoned from the mercury, filtered from traces of solid matter, and acidified with an excess of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.1). The hydrocinnamic acid separates as an oil and solidifies on thorough cooling. The yield of crude product, which contains water and other impurities, is 180\u2013200 g. It is purified by distillation under reduced pressure. The product boiling at 194\u2013197\u00b0/75 mm. (145\u2013147\u00b0/18 mm.) is colorless and melts at 47.5\u201348\u00b0. The yield of distilled acid is 160\u2013180 g. (80\u201390 per cent of the theoretical amount) depending upon the quality of the cinnamic acid used (Note 4)."

The mixture is heated to about 50\u00b0 on a water bath, and 275 cc. (6.15 moles) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50) is added slowly from the separatory funnel; the time required for the addition should be about one and one-quarter hours. A copious evolution of oxides of nitrogen takes place, and the gases are carried off from the upper end of the condenser to an open window or hood, or absorbed by means of a gas trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97). The reaction proceeds smoothly (Note 1), and the temperature rises slowly without the application of heat until the mixture boils gently. When all the nitric acid has been added, the solution is refluxed for about fifteen minutes. If iodine still remains, more nitric acid should be added slowly to the warm solution until the purple color of the iodine has been discharged and the solution becomes brownish red.\nThe lower reddish oily layer is separated, mixed with an equal volume of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and steam-distilled from a 2-l. flask until no more oil passes over. Towards the end of the distillation a yellow solid begins to collect in the receiver; this consists of nitro compounds, which are removed by vigorously stirring the oil for about three hours with 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 300 cc. of water, and 200 g. of iron filings in a 2-l. flask connected with a reflux condenser.\nThe mixture is allowed to cool and is then filtered. The filtrate is rendered distinctly acid to Congo red with hydrochloric acid and again distilled with steam. The oil so obtained is separated and distilled under normal pressure with the use of a fractionating column (Note 2). The fraction boiling at 180\u2013190\u00b0 is redistilled, and the pure compound is collected at 184\u2013186\u00b0. The yield is 523\u2013531 g.

        "Procedure": [
            "In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is placed a cold solution of 144 g. (1 mole) of \u03b2-naphthol in 200 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol (Note 1). To this solution is added first 212 g. (2 moles) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde (which has been previously freed from acid by shaking with 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution) and then about 200 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol which has been saturated with ammonia at room temperature. The solution becomes red and warms up spontaneously. The flask is stoppered and allowed to stand for two hours. Then the stopper is removed, and the excess ammonia is allowed to escape. After about twelve hours, the condensation product, which has separated as white needles, is filtered with suction and washed with 50 cc. of alcohol. The mother liquors on standing for three days deposit an additional quantity of the condensation product (Note 2). The yield is 284\u2013306 g. (84\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 148\u2013150\u00b0.\nThe condensation product thus obtained is introduced into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask arranged for steam distillation, and treated with three to four times its volume of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid. The mixture is steam distilled to remove all benzaldehyde formed by the hydrolysis (about two hours) (Note 3). Meanwhile, an abundant flocculent precipitate of light pink or white needles separates. The mixture in the flask is cooled thoroughly and filtered with suction. The yield is 240\u2013260 g. (84\u201391 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 190\u2013220\u00b0 with decomposition (Note 4).\nThe hydrochloride thus obtained varies from pure white to a light red in color, depending on the purity of the original reagents and on the length of time required for the hydrolysis. However, the color does not interfere with isolation of a pure white free base when the salt is treated with alkali. The salt is somewhat more stable than the free base, and, if the reagent is to be stored for some time, it should be kept in this form.\nIn order to obtain the amine, 200 g. of finely divided hydrochloride is placed in a 1500-cc. beaker and stirred into a smooth paste with 300 cc. of water. To this is added 50 g. of crushed ice, and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath (Note 5). Then 750\u2013800 cc. of 5 per cent aqueous potassium hydroxide is added slowly and with stirring until a nearly clear solution results. The cold solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted eight to ten times with 300-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is dried overnight with 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to about 300 cc. When the solution is cooled in an ice bath, the amine crystallizes and is filtered with suction. The first crop of crystals weighs 112\u2013115 g. Further concentration of the mother liquors to about 100 cc. and cooling yield 14\u201318 g. more of the product (Note 6). The total yield is 127\u2013131 g. (73\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 124\u2013125\u00b0 (Note 7). If desired, it may be purified by dissolving in an excess of dry ether, evaporating the excess of solvent, and allowing the amine to crystallize. Thus, 24.5 g. of the amine, when dissolved in 800 cc. of dry ether and the solution filtered and evaporated in a current of air to 150 cc., yields 18\u201319 g. of product, melting at 124\u2013125\u00b0"

Heat is applied and the mixture is refluxed gently for one hour after solution is practically complete (total about three hours). The resulting dark solution is allowed to cool and is poured slowly into 12 l. of cold water in a crock (Note 2).\nAfter cooling, the dense orange-yellow precipitate is filtered with suction. This crop of crystals after air-drying weighs about 70 g. and melts at 68\u201370\u00b0. The filtrate is returned to the crock and made slightly alkaline with 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (about 2.25 l.). It is then made barely acid to litmus with sulfuric acid. This neutralization will produce considerable heat, and the mixture should be thoroughly cooled before filtering. This second crop of crystals weighs about 22\u201325 g. and melts at 69\u201370.5\u00b0. The total crude yield is 90\u201395 g.\nThe two crops of crystals may be combined for recrystallization from boiling water, using 1 l. for each 9 g. The hot solution is filtered quickly, and the filtrate is cooled thoroughly and filtered with suction. The crystals are dried at 50\u00b0. The product melts at 69\u201371\u00b0. An alternative method of purification is to dissolve the crude product in about 250 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, filter the solution, dilute with 1 l. of hot water, and warm on a steam bath if a precipitate forms. On cooling this solution, the product separates in orange-brown needles, and is filtered and air-dried. The yield is about 78 g. (56 per cent of the theoretical amount), m.p. 69.5\u201370.5\u00b0."

(5 moles) of nitromethane (p. 401), 530 g. (5 moles) of benzaldehyde (Note 1), and 1000 cc. of methyl alcohol. A solution of sodium hydroxide is prepared by dissolving 210 g. (5.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide in approximately an equal volume of water and cooling. It is then diluted to 500 cc. with ice and water, poured into the funnel, and added with stirring to the nitromethane mixture at such a rate that the temperature is kept at 10\u201315\u00b0 (Note 2) and (Note 3).\nA bulky white precipitate forms rapidly during the addition of the alkali. The mixture gets so thick that stirring becomes difficult and it may be advisable to add 100 cc. more of methyl alcohol. After fifteen minutes' standing, the pasty mass is converted to a clear solution by the addition of 3\u20133.5 l. of ice water containing crushed ice (Note 4). Hydrochloric acid (made by diluting 1000 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid with 1500 cc. of water) is placed in a 15-l. mixing jar and the reaction mixture run into this from the separatory funnel at such a rate that the stream just fails to break into drops (Note 5). A pale yellow crystalline mass separates almost immediately as the alkaline solution comes in contact with the acid. After the stirring is stopped, the solid settles to the bottom of the jar. The major part of the cloudy liquid layer is removed by decantation, and the residue filtered by suction and washed with water until free from chlorides. This product is freed from all but a negligible amount of water by melting in a beaker immersed in hot water. Two layers are formed, and on cooling again the lower layer of nitrostyrene freezes; the water may then be poured off. The crude nitrostyrene is purified by dissolving in 420 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol (Note 6), filtering the solution into a warm suction flask to remove solid impurities, and then cooling until crystallization is complete. The yield of crude product melting at 56\u201358\u00b0 is 650\u2013670 g. The yield of recrystallized nitrostyrene melting sharply at 57\u201358\u00b0 is 600\u2013620 g.

(0.43 mole) of phosphorus tribromide; this results in the formation of a light-colored solution. With careful cooling, this solution is treated, with shaking, with 65 g. (20.8 cc., 0.405 mole) of bromine. The flask is now connected for distillation under reduced pressure, and the solution is heated gradually for a few minutes until the rapid evolution of gas ceases. The product is then distilled under reduced pressure. At about 70\u00b0/20 mm. a mixture of pentamethylene bromide, phosphorus oxybromide, and benzonitrile begins to distil over into the receiver; a yellow solid collects in the condenser. This is then followed by a black decomposition product, at which point the distillation is stopped. The distillate is poured upon ice and allowed to stand in order to decompose the phosphorus oxybromide, a process which requires about one hour if carried out in a flask fitted with a reflux condenser and mechanical stirrer.\nThe heavy oil is removed from the water; it consists of pentamethylene bromide and benzonitrile. This oily layer is treated with 125 cc. of 40 per cent hydrobromic acid solution and boiled under a reflux condenser with vigorous stirring for about three hours in order to hydrolyze completely the benzonitrile to benzoic acid (Note 1). The mixture is then distilled with steam, an air condenser being placed between the distillation flask and the receiving flask to which is fitted a reflux condenser cooled with water. This apparatus is necessary to avoid clogging of the condenser tubes with the benzoic acid.

To this mixture is added 830 g. (7.0 atoms) of granulated tin in small portions, the reaction being started after the addition of 30\u201340 g. of the tin by immersing the flask in a hot-water bath (Note 3). The rest of the tin is added through the condenser at such a rate that the reaction proceeds briskly. It is advisable to carry out this reaction under a hood since hydrogen chloride is likely to escape at the beginning of the reaction. The mixture is finally heated on a steam bath for one hour in order to complete the reaction, and is then filtered hot through glass wool in order to remove unreacted tin.\nThe filtrate is made up to exactly 2 l., and a 50-cc. sample is titrated with sodium hydroxide solution of known concentration (35\u201340 per cent in a suitable strength). The volume of alkali necessary to produce a slight permanent precipitate is noted (it usually requires 6\u20138 cc. of 40 per cent alkali). More alkali is run in until the liquid is neutral to litmus paper: this second value represents the acid combined with tin. To the filtrate in the 5-l. flask are added 1 kg. of cracked ice and then sufficient alkali to neutralize the free acid as well as 60 per cent of that combined with the tin (about 800 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide is required). The mixture is diluted, without filtering, to 6 l. and boiled in a 12-l. flask under a reflux condenser in an atmosphere of coal gas (Note 4) for twenty hours. The precipitate is then filtered off and washed very thoroughly with boiling water (2\u20133 l. of water); the combined filtrates are concentrated to 3 l., then rendered slightly acid to litmus with hydrochloric acid, and chilled to 0\u00b0, when crystals of phloroglucinol separate. This crop is filtered off; it should weigh 70\u201380 g. It is then dissolved in 700 cc. of hot water, filtered, and allowed to crystallize at 0\u00b0. In this way 65\u201375 g.

(3 moles) of mucic acid (Note 1) and 900 cc. of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9); this mixture is rapidly stirred to a smooth paste under the hood. The paste is evaporated to complete dryness on a steam bath, and the resulting ammonium mucate is powdered and mixed with 350 cc. of glycerol (Note 2) in a 5-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask. After standing overnight, the mixture is carefully distilled over a free flame, the heat being applied to one side of the flask alone, so that only a portion of the mass is heated to the reaction temperature. The gases, which are evolved with considerable foaming (Note 3), are led away to a gas trap (Fig. 7, p. 97) or to the open air, on account of their disagreeable nature. The heating is extended throughout the mass as rapidly as appears possible from the state of the mixture. Distillation is continued until a sample of distillate no longer shows oily drops when treated with solid potassium hydroxide; the total volume of distillate amounts to 900\u20131000 cc.\nThe entire distillate is redistilled until no further oil separates in the distillate; the watery layer is then separated and returned to the reaction flask, together with the water remaining in the distilling flask. Two liters more of water is added, and about 800 cc. is distilled. The distillate is redistilled until 250\u2013300 cc. has collected in the receiver. This final distillate, on treatment with solid potash, yields a further 2 g. of oil.\nThe united oil is rapidly dried with a small quantity of solid potassium hydroxide (Note 4) and distilled. The fraction which boils at 127\u2013131\u00b0 is collected; this is a colorless liquid which darkens on exposure to light (Note 5). The yield is 75\u201380 g.

            "In a 2-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser are placed 219 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered acid ammonium o-sulfobenzoate (p. 14) and 200 cc. of dry benzene (Note 1). To this is added with stirring 145 g. (86.3 cc., 1.22 moles) of thionyl chloride (b.p. 76\u201378\u00b0). A tube is connected to the upper end of the reflux condenser which passes into an ice-cooled flask; from this another tube is provided to carry off the hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide generated during the reaction (Fig. 7, p. 97). The mixture is gently warmed on a steam bath in such a way that gases are evolved fairly briskly (Note 2); continuous stirring is essential. The bulk of the entrained benzene and thionyl chloride is condensed in the ice-cooled receiver; the condensate is returned periodically to the reaction mixture through the separatory funnel. After about fifteen hours' heating, the evolution of gases slackens; an additional 400 cc. of dry benzene is then added and the heating continued until the evolution of gases ceases; this requires about five hours longer.\nThe hot mixture is then filtered (Note 3) with suction into a 2-l. flask, and the solid material, consisting of ammonium chloride, is washed with 100 cc. of hot benzene. This solid is then returned to the 2-l. flask and boiled with stirring for one hour with 300 cc. of dry benzene; the mixture while hot is then filtered with suction into the same 2-l. flask. The combined filtrates and washings are then distilled until about 300 cc. of benzene has been removed, after which the solution is cooled in an ice bath; this causes the greater part of the sulfobenzoic anhydride to crystallize. The benzene mother liquor is decanted from these crystals and the bulk of the solvent removed by distillation.\nThe flask containing the crystals is attached to a condenser and heated until the solid has completely melted; the adhering solvent is then removed from the liquid by slightly reducing the pressure. The clear residue is poured into a dish and allowed to cool. The product thus obtained melts at 121\u2013123\u00b0. The residue from the mother liquor, being as a rule somewhat dark in color, is preferably distilled under reduced pressure (Note 4), the flask being heated in a metal bath. The anhydride distils at 184\u2013186\u00b0/18 mm. The second crop may have a slightly lower melting point. The total yield of o-sulfobenzoic anhydride, which is of sufficient purity for the preparation of sulfonephthaleins, amounts to 118\u2013121 g. (64\u201366 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 5). In order to convert this into a product melting at 126\u2013127\u00b0 (Note 4), it is recrystallized from three times its weight of dry benzene."

        "Procedure": [
            "A 1-l. wide-necked, round-bottomed flask is set into an iron dish of about 1.3\u20131.5 l. capacity and the space between is filled with fine sand so that the flask rests about 1 cm. from the bottom of the dish (Note 1). In the flask is placed 26 g. (1.1 atoms) (twice the theoretical amount) of sodium cut into thin slices (Note 2), and the flask is then closed with a tight-fitting cork stopper through which is inserted a separatory funnel (Note 3) and a long, wide, Liebig condenser through the jacket of which is passed downward a rapid current of air (Note 4).\nWhile this set-up is being prepared a solution of 20 g. (0.14 mole) of \u03b2-naphthylamine in 250 cc. of isoamyl alcohol (dried by distilling off a moist forerun) is heated to boiling. The boiling solution is poured in a stream through the separatory funnel into the flask upon the sodium and then washed down with 50 cc. of boiling isoamyl alcohol. A very violent reaction begins immediately which slows up after about five minutes and then must be aided by warming. The flame is so regulated that the reaction mixture is always boiling very vigorously until all the sodium is dissolved. This generally requires about three or four hours. If after three hours the sodium is not completely dissolved it is advisable, in order to hasten the reaction, to add 50 cc. more of isoamyl alcohol.\nWhen all the sodium is completely dissolved, the hot, yellow solution is allowed to cool to about 100\u00b0 and then poured into 500 cc. of cold water. The mixture is allowed to cool completely with frequent shaking, and then the upper isoamyl alcohol layer is separated from the water layer which contains the principal part of the sodium hydroxide.\nThe reduction is repeated four times with 20 g. of \u03b2-naphthylamine so that altogether 100 g. of naphthylamine has been reduced (Note 5). The isoamyl alcohol solutions from all five portions are combined, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the solution is just acid to litmus. For this purpose usually about 40\u201350 cc. is needed (Note 6). The greater part of the isoamyl alcohol is now distilled from a large flask (about 900\u20131100 cc. is recovered). The distillation is continued until a crust of crystals starts to form, and the residue is then cooled and treated with 200\u2013300 cc. of water and about 300 cc. of 50 per cent potassium hydroxide solution. The base which separates is extracted is the separatory funnel with four 400\u2013500 cc. portions of ether and the ether extracts combined in a wide-necked flask.\nThe flask is set in ice water, and a rapid stream of carbon dioxide, which has previously passed through two wash bottles containing water (Note 7), is passed in. After about one-quarter hour the liquid begins to become cloudy, and soon after there follows a rather rapid separation of the carbonate of the strongly basic alicyclic compound; the aromatic base does not react but remains in solution. The carbondioxide is passed in continuously until no more carbonate separates; this requires about four to six hours. The carbonate is filtered by suction on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with a little dry ether. The filtrate is again treated with carbon dioxide; there is often obtained still more carbonate which is added to the precipitate (Note 8).\nFor further purification, the almost dry carbonate is dissolved in 500\u2013600 cc. of 7 per cent acetic acid and the solution is filtered from the dark impurities. The clear, almost colorless solution is decomposed with a large excess of potassium hydroxide (about 200 cc. of a 50 per cent solution), whereupon the alicyclic base separates as a light-brown oil which collects on the surface of the water solution and is extracted as rapidly as possible by shaking three or four times with ether. The ether solution is dried for at least six hours with about 90\u2013100 g. of potassium hydroxide (Note 9). The distillation of the ether is carried out most conveniently in a specially designed Claisen flask (Fig. 26) of 100\u2013150 cc. capacity,\nFig. 26.\nthe ether solution gradually being added to the flask from the separatory funnel.\nThe base is distilled under the reduced pressure obtained by a water pump, because it is easily decomposed under ordinary pressure. For this distillation a flask of the form shown in Fig. 26 is recommended for use (Note 10) though it is not essential.\nSince the base is sensitive to oxygen, dry hydrogen is passed through the capillary tube used in the distillation (Note 11). The distillation of the base runs very smoothly, and the liquid distils over from beginning to end almost constantly within a degree.\nThe yield of pure distilled base, b.p. 118.5\u00b0/8 mm., 127.5\u2013128\u00b0/12 mm., 140\u2013140.5\u00b0/20 mm., amounts to 53\u201359 g. (51\u201357 per cent of the theoretical amount). The pure base can be preserved only by sealing it in ampules (containing as little air as possible) immediately after distillation. The ac-tetrahydro-\u03b2-naphthylamine is a colorless, water-clear liquid which shows no fluorescence (Note 12) and possesses a strong odor similar to piperidine. In the air the base soon turns brown, rapidly absorbs carbon dioxide, and changes to the carbonate.\nThe hydrochloride of the ac-tetrahydro-\u03b2-naphthylamine can be obtained readily by neutralizing a dry ether solution of the base with an ether solution of hydrogen chloride. It crystallizes from water in large plates which melt at 237\u00b0 (Note 13) and (Note 14)."

            "In a 12-l. flask fitted with stirrer and reflux condenser are placed 600 g. (3.8 moles) of potassium permanganate, 7 l. of water, and 200 g. (1.6 moles) of o-chlorotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 170). The mixture is slowly heated to boiling (Note 1) with continual stirring until the permanganate color has disappeared. This requires three to four hours. The condenser is now set downward for distillation, and the mixture is distilled, with constant stirring, until no more oil passes over with the water. The unattacked o-chlorotoluene thus obtained amounts to 25\u201330 g. The hot mixture is filtered with suction and the cake of hydrated manganese dioxide washed with two 500-cc. portions of hot water. The combined filtrate is concentrated (Note 2) to about 3.5 l.; if it is not entirely clear it may be clarified by the use of 1\u20132 g. of decolorizing carbon. It is now, while still hot, acidified by cautiously adding 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with continual agitation. When the mixture is cool the white precipitate of o-chlorobenzoic acid is filtered and washed with cold water. The dry weight is 163\u2013167 g. (76\u201378 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the amount of o-chlorotoluene actually oxidized) of a very nearly pure (Note 3) product melting at 137\u2013138\u00b0. For purification this may be recrystallized from 600 cc. of toluene, when 135\u2013140 g. of a product melting at 139\u2013140\u00b0 is obtained. Further crops can be obtained by concentrating the mother liquor."

        "Procedure": [
            "(A) Ethyl Nitrite.\u2014Two solutions are prepared. Solution I contains 620 g. (9 moles) of sodium nitrite (650 g. of technical 95 per cent quality), 210 g. (4.6 moles) of alcohol (285 cc. of 90 per cent denatured alcohol, or its equivalent), and water to make a total volume of 2.5 l. Solution II contains 440 g. of sulfuric acid (255 cc. of sp. gr. 1.84) and 210 g. of alcohol, diluted with water to 2.5 l. Ethyl nitrite may be generated continuously in gaseous form by allowing solution II to flow into solution I.\nThe gas can be conveniently made by putting solution II in a 2.5-l. bottle fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper (Fig. 7) and provided with glass tubing as indicated in the diagram. The rate of flow of solution II into a 6-l. bottle containing solution I is regulated by a screw clamp. The ethyl nitrite generated flows out of the second opening in the stopper of the lower bottle. The stoppers to both bottles should be wired on. A mechanical stirrer in the lower bottle is helpful in securing a steady evolution of the gas (Note 1).\nFig. 7\n(B) Biacetyl Monoxime.\u2014In a 2-l. three-necked flask provided with a condenser, a thermometer, and an inlet tube for ethyl nitrite, and arranged for external cooling, is placed 620 g. of commercial methyl ethyl ketone which has been dried with, and filtered from, 75 g. of anhydrous copper sulfate. Forty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added (Note 2) and the temperature raised to 40\u00b0. The ethyl nitrite from the preceding preparation is now bubbled in, the temperature being maintained between 40\u00b0 and 55\u00b0. After all the ethyl nitrite has been passed in (Note 3) the crude product may be used in the preparation of dimethylglyoxime by distilling off the alcohol formed in the reaction until the temperature of the liquid reaches 90\u00b0 (Note 4).\nIf pure biacetyl monoxime is desired, the crude product is neutralized with about 35 cc. of concentrated aqueous ammonia and diluted with half its volume of water. It is then distilled to remove alcohol, etc., until the distillate is no longer inflammable. The receiver is changed, and the contents are now rapidly distilled, using superheated steam. Almost all the biacetyl monoxime comes over in the first 5 l. of distillate. One to 1.5 kg. of salt is dissolved in the distillate, which is then cooled to 0\u00b0. The solid biacetyl monoxime crystallizes and may be filtered. The yield is 480\u2013520 g. The product can be further purified, if desired, by recrystallizing from water (Note 5).\n(C) Sodium Hydroxylamine Monosulfonate.\u2014In a 12-l. crock are mixed 5 kg. of shaved ice (Note 6) and 569 g. of sodium nitrite (594 g. of the technical 95 per cent quality). Into this is stirred a suspension of sodium bisulfite containing 1.1 kg. of available sulfur dioxide (about 1775 g. of technical bisulfite) in 750 cc. of water. Then, beneath the surface of the solution is added, with constant stirring, 150 cc. of glacial acetic acid (Note 7) followed by a mixture of 550 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with 400 g. of shaved ice (Note 8). The entire solution should always remain below 0\u00b0, further ice being added if there is a tendency for the temperature to rise. The solution should now become acid to Congo red paper and contain 6 or more moles of the sodium hydroxylamine disulfonate, which rapidly hydrolyzes to an acid solution of the monosulfonate.\n(D) Dimethylglyoxime.\u2014The crude biacetyl monoxime remaining after distilling to 90\u00b0, and containing about 5 moles of biacetyl monoxime, is added to the sodium hydroxylamine monosulfonate solution (which has been filtered to remove any sediment) and which is contained in a 15-l. flask. It is heated to 70\u00b0 and allowed to remain warm (with occasional stirring) for several hours (Note 9). The dimethylglyoxime separates in crystals which can be filtered from the solution as soon as it has become cold (Note 10). The crystals are washed with cold water until free of sulfate. The yield of compound melting at 238\u2013240\u00b0 is 540\u2013575 g.\nRecrystallization is unnecessary since the product is pure white and free from tarry material (Note 5).\n(E) Sodium Dimethylglyoximate.\u2014To a solution of 75 g. of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water is added, with stirring, 100 g. of dimethylglyoxime (Note 11). Heat is applied to effect solution (Note 12), and the mixture is filtered from any slight residue. The solution is poured while hot into 500 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. After cooling to 5\u00b0, with stirring, the crystals which form are filtered, then suspended in 150 cc. of alcohol and again filtered, and finally dried at 25\u00b0 until the solid has no odor of alcohol (Note 13). The yield is 213\u2013230 g. (81\u201388 per cent of the theoretical amount) of the octahydrate."

            "A piece of glass tubing 80 cm. long and 2 cm. in internal diameter is sealed at one end and loosely packed with 49 g. (0.25 mole) of benzophenone oxime (p. 70). The tube is supported in a nearly horizontal position, dipping slightly toward the closed end, and connected to a small filter flask by means of rubber stoppers and a piece of glass tubing bent at a right angle. The system is evacuated by means of a water pump, and dry carbon dioxide is admitted; the system is re-evacuated and carbon dioxide is admitted again. The oxime is then heated with a free flame, beginning at the upper end and heating at one spot until decomposition takes place before heating a further portion (Note 1). When all the oxime has been decomposed, the mixture which has collected at the closed end of the tube (Note 2) is heated strongly for a short time to complete the decomposition, and allowed to cool. Suction is again applied to the tube, and the condensed water is driven out by gently warming the tube. The liquid is then transferred to a small distilling flask and distilled at a pressure of about 20 mm. The distillate, consisting of a mixture of benzophenone and diphenylmethane imine, is dissolved in 400 cc. of ligroin (60\u201390\u00b0), and the imine hydrochloride is precipitated by bubbling in dry hydrogen chloride. The salt is filtered with suction (Note 3), washed with a little ligroin, dried, and preserved in a dry atmosphere (Note 4). It sublimes without decomposition at 230\u2013250\u00b0 (Note 5).

        "Procedure": [
            "A 5-l. flask, mounted on a steam bath, is fitted with a wide (Note 1) inlet tube reaching to the bottom of the flask, a reflux condenser, and a delivery tube running from the top of the reflux condenser and reaching to the bottom of a heavy glass cylinder containing a column of mercury about 10 cm. high. All stoppers and joints of the apparatus must fit tightly and be wired, as the reaction is carried out under a slight pressure. In the flask are placed 3180 g. (3.7 l., 30 moles) of xylene (Note 2) and 1 kg. of anhydrous aluminum chloride (Note 2). The inlet tube of the flask is then connected to a tank of methyl chloride or to a methyl chloride generator (Note 3), the steam is turned on in the bath, and a fairly rapid stream of methyl chloride is passed into the mixture (Note 4). At first there will be a rapid absorption, and the stream of gas must be regulated so that the mercury in the pressure tube does not suck back. The hydrogen chloride formed may be conveniently disposed of by a trap. As the reaction slows down, the pressure increases until both hydrogen chloride and methyl chloride begin to escape through the mercury. At this point the current of incoming gas should be cut down so that undue loss of methyl chloride is avoided. About one hundred hours is required for the completion of the reaction (Note 5).\nWhen the reaction is completed, the steam is turned off and the flask is disconnected and loosely stoppered. After standing overnight the reaction mixture is decomposed by pouring it slowly onto 5 kg. of chopped ice. The greenish oil which separates from the aqueous layer is removed, dried over calcium chloride, filtered and fractionated twice, using a round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient column and an air condenser (Note 6).\nThe fractions are cut as follows:\nFraction\nTemp. Range\nDistillate\nYield, g.\nI and II\nUp to 150\u00b0\nBenzene, xylene\nLittle\nIII\n150 to 180\nTrimethyl benzenes\n570\nIV\n180 to 205\nTetramethyl benzenes\n2075\nV\nAbove 205\nMostly pentamethylbenzene\n815\nTypical yields of the various fractions are given in the table; they may vary 10 to 20 per cent from these figures, owing to slight differences in procedure and materials, and especially to differences in the quality of the aluminum chloride employed. The more efficient the aluminum chloride, the greater is the percentage of the higher-boiling fractions.\nThe tetramethylbenzene fraction (IV) is rich in durene, which may be frozen out and filtered because of its relatively high melting point (80\u00b0). To isolate the durene, fraction IV is thoroughly chilled in an ice-calcium chloride pack, and filtered through a cold filter (Note 7), using good suction and pressing down the solid compactly. When no more liquid drips through the cold filter, the filtration apparatus is allowed to come gradually to room temperature (Note 7) and the suction is continued as long as any liquid drips through, after which the solid is removed and bottled. The yield is 540 to 610 g.\nFraction III may be methylated to the tetramethylbenzene stage by heating on the steam bath with 100 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride and passing in 225 g. of methyl chloride. The filtrates from the durene likewise yield more durene when heated on the steam bath with 50 g. of aluminum chloride. The products are worked up in the usual way; that is, they are decomposed by pouring onto twice their weight of chopped ice, separated from the aqueous layer, fractionated twice, and the durene frozen out as before. By conducting one methylation of the trimethylbenzene fraction, and one treatment of the durene filtrates, the combined yield of crude durene will average 1 to 1.4 kg. (25\u201335 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original 30 moles of xylene).\nTo purify the durene, 200 g. of the crude product is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and melted in a water bath at 95\u00b0; 200 cc. of warm (50\u00b0) 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is then added through the top of the condenser, and the mixture is carefully heated until homogeneous. The solution is filtered on a hot-water funnel, allowed to stand tightly covered (Note 8) in a fairly warm place (35\u00b0) overnight, cooled to about 0\u00b0, and filtered on a suction filter. The product (about 169 g.) melts at 74\u201378\u00b0. A second recrystallization yields 149 g. melting at 77\u201379\u00b0. A third recrystallization yields 140 g. having a melting point of 79\u201380\u00b0. The alcoholic filtrates are fractionated, and the crude durene obtained is worked over with the isomers of durene.\nPentamethylbenzene.\u2014Fraction V, and xylene which is methylated beyond the tetramethylbenzene stage, may be worked up for pentamethylbenzene. If xylene is to be methylated to obtain pentamethylbenzene, one more mole of methyl chloride should be used, and the mixture of xylene and anhydrous aluminum chloride should be methylated for one hundred and ten hours instead of the one hundred used for durene. Otherwise the procedure is exactly the same as for durene. The reaction mixture is decomposed and fractionated in the usual way, and the material boiling above 205\u00b0 (fraction V) is separated into three fractions:\nFraction\nTemperature Range\nVI\n205\u2013215\u00b0\nTetra- and pentamethylbenzene\nVII\n215\u2013235\nMostly pentamethylbenzene\nVIII\nResidue above 235\nHexamethylbenzene and tars\nThe pentamethylbenzene obtained in this way is nearly pure, and one recrystallization from 95 per cent alcohol or from a mixture of equal volumes of alcohol and benzene gives a snow-white product, but the product generally melts over too wide a range for practical purposes. However, if fraction VII is refractionated under diminished pressure and the fraction boiling at 123\u2013133\u00b0/22 mm. (practically all at 127\u2013129\u00b0) is collected and recrystallized as in the following paragraph, a product melting quite sharply at 52\u00b0 (true m.p. 53\u00b0) is obtained.\nSix hundred grams of crude pentamethylbenzene is heated to 100\u00b0 and poured slowly with stirring into 1 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol heated to 70\u00b0 in a 2-l. beaker, and allowed to stand overnight at a temperature of approximately 30\u00b0. The crystals formed are collected on a suction filter and dried at room temperature overnight on a porous plate. The yield is about 250 g. (Note 9).\nHexamethylbenzene.\u2014Fraction VIII is fractionated in 250-cc. batches in a Claisen flask at 20 mm. pressure, the following fractions being collected:\nFraction\nTemperature Range\nIX\n80\u2013110\u00b0\nMostly tetra- and pentamethyl benzenes\nX\n110\u2013135\nMostly pentamethylbenzene\nXI\n135\u2013170\nHexamethylbenzene\nXII\nResidue above 170\nHexamethylbenzene and tars\nThis fractionation may be carried out in an ordinary Claisen flask, but there is some difficulty in maintaining the desired pressure owing to the solvent action of the hydrocarbons on the rubber stopper. This difficulty may be avoided by the use of a Claisen flask with very long necks and a wide side tube. The material should be distilled fast enough to prevent it from solidifying in the column and side tube. Prolonged heating of hexamethylbenzene also causes a considerable amount of decomposition to tars.\nThe method for the production of large amounts of hexamethylbenzene is the rapid methylation of pentamethylbenzene or the durene filtrates. A mixture of 378 g. of pentamethylbenzene and 200 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride is heated on an oil bath at 190\u2013200\u00b0 and a rapid stream of dry methyl chloride is bubbled through for three to four hours, using the same apparatus as for the preparation of durene. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. One liter of hot xylene is added to dissolve the solidified material, and the reaction mixture is decomposed by pouring it onto 3 kg. of chopped ice. The resulting oil is separated, and the xylene and other low-boiling material are removed by distillation under reduced pressure (Note 10). The fractions are divided as above. Two refractionations and two recrystallizations (Note 11) give 98\u2013121 g. of white crystals, melting at 157\u2013161\u00b0 (Note 12)."

(0.1 mole) (Note 1) and (Note 2) of durene (p. 248) in 100 cc. of chloroform is added to 75 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in an 800-cc. beaker provided with a thermometer and an efficient mechanical stirrer. The mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0, and 16 g. (10.7 cc.) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.5) (Note 3) is added drop by drop, with stirring, from a 125-cc. separatory funnel, the mixture being cooled in an ice-salt bath and the nitric acid added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 50\u00b0 (about fifteen minutes is required for the addition). As soon as all the acid has been added the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, the sulfuric acid layer is removed, and the upper chloroform layer is immediately (Note 4) run into 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution. The sulfuric acid layer is discarded because it contains very little dinitrodurene. Four portions are nitrated, and the combined chloroform solutions are washed twice with 2.5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, dried overnight with 30 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and the chloroform distilled until crystals of dinitrodurene begin to appear. At this point four times the volume of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added (about 500 cc.), and the resulting mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0. The solid is filtered and washed twice with 50 cc. of cold (10\u00b0) 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The yield from four nitrations is 82.5\u201384 g. (92\u201394 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 207\u2013208\u00b0 (Note 5).\n(B) Reduction of Dinitrodurene.\u2014A solution of 90 g. of dinitrodurene in 1 l. of glacial acetic acid is boiled in a 12-l. flask (Note 6); 700 g. of stannous chloride is dissolved in 800 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to boiling. The heat is removed from the acetic acid solution of the nitro compound, and the stannous chloride solution is poured very carefully (during about ten minutes) into the dinitrodurene solution. The reaction is complete in fifteen minutes, and, as the solution cools, the stannic chloride compound of the diamine begins to crystallize. The reaction mixture is cooled to 10\u00b0 in an ice-water bath, and the solid is filtered by suction, washed twice with 50 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and twice with 50 cc. of ether, and dried. The filtrates from the tin compound contain very little of the reduction product and may be discarded. The composition of this compound is [C6(CH3)4(NH2\u00b7HCl)2]2\u00b7SnCl4, and it crystallizes from the reaction mixture in fine, glistening plates which are almost colorless. The yield is 145 g. (97 per cent of the theoretical amount).\n(C) Duroquinone.\u2014A suspension of 100 g. of the tin compound in a solution of 300 g. of ferric chloride crystals in a mixture of 150 cc. of water and 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is allowed to stand overnight at about 30\u00b0, and is then filtered. The product is dissolved in 150 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The solution is filtered and allowed to stand overnight at 30\u00b0. The yield is 40 g. of duroquinone (90 per cent of the theoretical amount) melting at 109\u2013110\u00b0."

The mixture is gently shaken until the hydroxide is dissolved, 1330 g. (1.5 l., approximately 4 equivalents) of rape-seed oil is added with shaking (Note 1), and the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for twenty-five to thirty hours.\nThe hot mixture is poured, with stirring, into 15 l. of warm water (50\u201360\u00b0), and is followed by 700 cc. (8.2 moles) of concentrated (36 per cent) hydrochloric acid (Note 2). After standing until the layers are distinct (ten to fifteen minutes), the lower layer is siphoned off as completely as possible and the oil is washed with two 1-l. portions of warm water.\nThe oil thus obtained, which should amount to 1460\u20131600 cc., is dissolved in three times its volume of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and the mixture cooled to \u221210 to 0\u00b0, when the erucic acid crystallizes (Note 3). After six to eight hours at this temperature, the crude erucic acid is collected on a basket centrifuge (Note 4). The mother liquor, on chilling, yields a second crop of erucic acid. The combined product (800\u20131100 g.) melts either partially or wholly at room temperature, owing to the presence of oleic acid. It is dissolved in an equal volume of alcohol, chilled for six hours at 0\u00b0, and centrifuged as before, when it is obtained in well-defined crystalline form. The second crop of this recrystallization resembles that of the first crystallization and must again be recrystallized. The product is finally recrystallized once again from an equal volume of 95 per cent alcohol. The recrystallized acid contains alcohol, which is removed by heating to constant weight on the steam bath under diminished pressure. The yield of acid is 260\u2013360 g. (Note 5); the acid melts at 31\u201332\u00b0 (Note 6)."

            "The apparatus is assembled as shown in Fig. 2. Alcohol vapor from vaporizer flask E is passed through the acid contained in esterification flask J. The ester which is formed remains in J whereas the excess alcohol and the water formed during esterification continuously distil through column K into condenser L (Note 1). Flask E is a 250-cc. Pyrex distilling flask equipped with an extra side-arm D. Alcohol is run from dropping funnel F into flask E, a sufficient head being maintained by the height of funnel G. Stopcock G' is kept open, the flow of alcohol being regulated by stopcock F'. Side-arm H may be wrapped with asbestos paper to lessen condensation.\nSide-arm D connects with two mercury safety valves, C and B. Tube C' dips about 3 cm. under the surface of the mercury contained in test tube C. This valve guards against excess internal pressure sometimes caused by the plugging of delivery tube I. Loud bubbling in the mercury quickly results from any clogging (Note 2) in the apparatus. Glass tube A (preferably a large capillary) barely dips into the mercury which just seals the bend of U-tube B. This valve guards against any fall of pressure within the system (Note 3), which would result in the transfer of the contents of flask J into vaporizer E, were it not compensated by the inrush of air through A. Since there is some lag in this pressure compensation, the alcohol vapor delivery tube I should be about 30 cm. long; it should reach to within 2 or 3 cm. of the bottom of flask J and should extend about 10 cm. above the stopper of the flask. The delivery end may be drawn out to a coarse capillary (Note 4).\nEsterification flask J is a 1-l. Pyrex round-bottom flask fitted with a 3-hole rubber stopper, carrying thermometer T, delivery tube I and column K.\nFig. 2.\nThermometer T should reach to within a few centimeters of the bottom of the flask, so as to register the temperature of the liquid esterification mixture. Flask J is immersed in and heated by the oil contained in deep dish O. Thermometer T' dips into the oil bath. Fractionating column K (Note 5) leads the vapor mixture of alcohol and water into condenser L.\nEsterification flask J is charged with 348 g. (3 moles) of fumaric acid and 350 cc. (Note 6) of 96 per cent ethyl alcohol containing 15 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The oil bath is heated until the temperature of the reaction mixture in J is 110\u00b0 (Note 7). During the preliminary heating about 200 cc. of alcohol distils from J. Then vaporizer E is heated over a gauze by a flame and the flow of 96 per cent (Note 8) alcohol (Note 9) from dropping tunnel F is so regulated that the temperature of the esterification mixture in J remains between 115\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, the temperature of the oil bath being maintained at about 150\u00b0. The reaction is stopped when 910 cc. of distillate has been collected; this requires about two hours.\nThe reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature and neutralized with sodium carbonate solution (Note 10). The ester is separated and the aqueous layer shaken with benzene (Note 11); the liquids are combined, the benzene is distilled through a fractionating column (Note 12), and the ester from a side-arm flask at ordinary pressure, and the portion boiling at 213-215\u00b0 is collected. The yield is 410 g. (80 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 13)."

            "The apparatus is assembled according to Fig. 3. A is a 500-cc. Pyrex filter flask. B is a 2-l. three-neck round-bottom flask; into one of the side necks is fitted a 300-cc. dropping funnel C (Note 1), and the second side neck is closed with a loose-fitting, well-greased rubber stopper, which serves as a safety valve against any sudden increase of pressure in the generator.\nFig. 3.\nA long (75-cm.) water-cooled bulb condenser D is connected to the middle neck of the generator flask B. The large bore glass tube E connects the top of the condenser D with trap F, a 500-cc. filter flask, which is connected by means of a short rubber tube to the drying towers G and H (Note 2). These towers are conveniently made from glass condenser jackets; the bottom ends are sealed and the top ends closed with rubber stoppers (Note 3). Tower H is connected to \"sight flask\" I, a 500-cc. round-bottom flask. This in turn is connected to the absorption vessels J and K (500-cc. gas washing bottles), which are immersed in an ice-salt bath contained in dish L. Absorption bottle K is connected to \"sight flask\" M, a 500-cc. round-bottom flask similar to I. By means of the sight flasks I and M the efficiency of absorption can be judged by the depth of color. Flask I also serves to catch any liquid sucked back from the absorption vessels.\nBefore finally assembling the apparatus, the various units are charged as follows: A is one-third filled with water to serve as a bubble counter. Generator B is about one-quarter filled with dry arsenious oxide, pea size or powdered. Drying towers G and H are filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. (It is well to place a wad of glass wool in front of the entrance and exit tubes.) In each of the two absorption bottles J and K is placed 200 g. of ethyl malonate. Dish L is filled with an ice-salt freezing mixture.\nWhen assembled as indicated, the apparatus is ready for operation. Concentrated nitric acid is run, in small portions, into generator B from dropping funnel C. After the action has started, the nitric acid must be forced into flask B by applying a small air pressure at the top of dropping funnel C and then opening the stopcock. Later on, when the gas generation slackens, flask B is heated with a smoky flame. The evolution of gas is maintained at a steady rate by increasing the heat until finally all the arsenious oxide has dissolved and the frothing has ceased. During the whole operation a slow stream of compressed air (Note 4) is passed through the apparatus from \"bubble counter\" A. The stream of air is insufficient if any colorless gas, which turns brown on coming in contact with the air, leaves the apparatus at M. When the arsenious oxide is exhausted, as shown by a slackening in gas evolution, the old generator is removed and a fresh one put in its place. (If the generator is first allowed to cool somewhat, this change can be accomplished without much discomfort.) The moist oxides of nitrogen, in passing up through the condenser D, lose most of their moisture and the gas on passing down through tube E should deposit very little water in trap F. The gas is then thoroughly dried in the towers G and H. When the calcium chloride in G becomes wet (after several runs) the tower is refilled; at the same time G and H are interchanged. After passing through the drying towers and through flask I, the gas is absorbed by the cold ethyl malonate in vessels J and K. The ethyl malonate becomes dark green in color. There should be an increase in weight of about 200 g. in absorption bottle J in two or three hours (Note 5).\nThe rest of the directions are the same as in the original article by Dox (see Org. Synth. 1925, 4, 27)."

The mixture is refluxed for about four hours and then the solution is evaporated to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. The dry residue, consisting of glutaric acid and ammonium chloride, is extracted with about 300 cc. of boiling ether.

The flask is heated in an oil bath until the sodium is melted. The stirrer is then started; when the sodium is finely divided, the oil bath is removed and the mixture allowed to cool. Stirring must be continued during the cooling in order to keep the sodium finely divided.\nWhen the mixture has cooled to about 60\u00b0, there are added from the separatory funnel, first, a solution of 114 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl laurate (Note 3) in 150 cc. of absolute alcohol (Note 4), then 500 cc. more of alcohol, as rapidly as is possible (Note 5) without loss of material through the condenser. The time required for the addition of the ester solution and the alcohol is less than five minutes, usually two or three minutes. When the reaction has subsided, the flask is heated on a steam bath until the sodium is completely dissolved (Note 6). The mixture is then steam-distilled to remove the toluene and ethyl alcohol. The contents of the flask are transferred to a separatory funnel while still hot and washed three times with 200-cc. portions of hot water to remove the sodium laurate (Note 7). The lauryl alcohol is extracted with ether from the cooled mixture and the washings. The combined ether extracts are washed with water, sodium carbonate solution, and again with water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is evaporated and the lauryl alcohol distilled under diminished pressure. The yield is 60\u201370 g. (65\u201375 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product boiling at 143\u2013146\u00b0/18 mm. or 198\u2013200\u00b0/135 mm. (Note 8)."

            "One hundred fifty grams (1.8 moles) of pure cyanoacetamide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 179) is thoroughly mixed in a large (20-cm.) mortar with 150 g. (0.7 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride (Note 1). This mixture is transferred (Note 2) as quickly as possible to a 1-l. Claisen flask equipped with a 360\u00b0 thermometer and an air-intake tube (Note 3). The Claisen flask is connected by means of a double-length air condenser to a 250-cc. filter flask which in turn is connected to a water pump (Note 4) through a manometer.\nAfter the system has been evacuated to about 30 mm. of mercury, the Claisen flask is immersed in a boiling water bath. The mixture melts and its color deepens to orange. Boiling commences in about fifteen minutes, before the solid is completely melted, and the pressure rises to about 150 mm. owing to the liberation of hydrogen chloride and phosphorus oxychloride (Note 5). When the evolution of gas has slackened, as indicated by the fall of pressure and the less vigorous boiling of the reaction mixture (thirty to thirty-five minutes), the receiver is changed. The distilling flask is removed from the boiling water bath, wiped dry, and immersed in an oil bath at 140\u00b0 (Note 6); the fresh receiver is placed in ice water.\nThe malononitrile begins to distil at 113\u00b0/30 mm. (125\u00b0/50 mm.). The temperature of the oil bath is slowly raised over a period of twenty-five minutes to 180\u00b0 (Note 7) and the nitrile collected between 113\u00b0 and 125\u00b0. When the distillation has almost ceased, the oil bath is removed so as to prevent discoloration of the product (Note 8). The yield of crude nitrile is 80\u201395 g. (67\u201380 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 9). The nitrile may be purified by vacuum distillation (Note 10) with about 10 per cent loss; it is collected between 113\u00b0 and 120\u00b0/30 mm. One distillation yields a water-clear liquid, which quickly freezes to an ice-like solid (Note 11) melting at 28\u201330\u00b0. The product has a faint odor resembling that of acetamide."

            "In a 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, immersed in an ice-salt bath contained in a 2-gal. earthenware crock, is placed 150 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a small dropping funnel, and a thermometer reaching almost to the bottom of the flask (Note 1). The stirrer is started, and, when the sulfuric acid has cooled to ice temperature or below, 60 g. (0.5 mole) of pure acetophenone is slowly dropped in from the dropping funnel at such a rate (about ten minutes for the addition) that the temperature does not rise above 5\u00b0 (Note 2). After the reaction mixture has cooled, this time to about \u22127\u00b0, the cooled (15\u201320\u00b0) nitrating mixture, consisting of 40 cc. (0.65 mole) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42 at 15.5\u00b0) (Note 3) and 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate (100\u2013120 drops per minute) that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 0\u00b0 or lower (Note 4). After the nitrating acid has been added, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer and the contents of the flask are poured (Note 5), with vigorous manual stirring, into a mixture of 750 g. of cracked ice and 1.5 l. of water. The product separates as a yellow flocculent solid.\nAfter the ice has melted, the product is filtered by suction and the somewhat sticky mass pressed as dry as possible. It is transferred to a mortar and triturated with three successive 300-cc. portions of cold water (to remove acid); it is then stirred to a mush with two successive 25-cc. portions of ice-cold ethyl alcohol (to remove adhering oil); the solid is pressed dry on the suction filter after each of the five washings. The product is pressed on a porous plate and, when fairly dry (about one hour), is dissolved in 100\u2013120 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol (Note 6). The dark solution is filtered quickly through a small suction funnel (Note 7), and the hot filtrate is poured slowly into 1 l. of cold water which is stirred vigorously (Note 8) with a stirring rod during the addition and for several minutes afterward. After standing a few minutes the yellow solid is filtered by suction, washed with 200 cc. of cold water, sucked dry, and pressed out on a porous clay plate.\nWhen the reprecipitated m-nitroacetophenone (50\u201355 g.) is dry it is dissolved in 100 cc. of hot alcohol in a 300-cc. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath and shaken vigorously while crystallization is taking place. Because of the great change in solubility between 60\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 the agitation of the liquid must be vigorous during this temperature interval, or large clumps of crystals will be formed instead of the purer and more easily dried mush. After the temperature has reached 20\u00b0 (about one hour) the mixture is filtered by suction (Note 9). The solid (Note 10) is washed with 10 cc. of ice-cold alcohol and pressed dry on a clay plate. The product is light yellow; it softens at 74\u00b0 and melts at 76\u201378\u00b0. The total yield is 45 g. (55 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 11)."

The retort is then rinsed with 100 cc. of water and the rinsings are filtered and evaporated on the steam bath to 25 cc. (Note 7). The last distillate is also evaporated to 25 cc. On cooling, pyromellitic acid crystallizes. The product from both portions is collected on a suction funnel, using hardened filter paper, washed with two 10-cc. portions of ice water (Note 8), and recrystallized from four parts of boiling water. After drying at 105\u00b0 the product (containing 2 moles of water of crystallization) melts at 271\u00b0 (262\u00b0 uncorr.). The yield is 6\u20138 g. (Note 9)."

            "In a 5-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a solution containing 200 g. (1.8 moles) of resorcinol, 1 kg. (9.9 moles) of potassium acid carbonate (Note 1), and 2 l. of water (Note 2) is heated slowly on a steam bath for four hours. The flask is then placed over a flame and refluxed vigorously for thirty minutes; a rapid stream of carbon dioxide is passed through the solution during this heating process.\nWhile still hot the solution is acidified by adding 900 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) from a separatory funnel with a tube delivering the acid to the bottom of the flask; this prevents the formation of a layer of acid over the unneutralized solution. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then chilled in an ice bath. The resorcyclic acid crystallizes in prisms which are almost colorless but which, on exposure to air, turn pink owing to contamination with a small amount of resorcinol. The yield of crude acid is 225 g. By extracting the mother liquor with ether several times, 35 g. of resorcylic acid and some unchanged resorcinol can be recovered. The resorcylic acid is extracted from the ether by shaking with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and again extracted withether. The ether is then evaporated, leaving the resorcylic acid, which is usually highly colored and must be recrystallized several times from boiling water and charcoal to remove the color.\nThe combined yield of crude acid (260\u2013270 g.) is dissolved in 1 l. of water, boiled with about 25 g. of Norite, filtered through a heated filter, and crystallized by placing in an ice-salt freezing mixture and stirring vigorously. A finely crystalline, colorless product is obtained in this way. If the acid is allowed to crystallize slowly the crystals are somewhat colored. The yield of pure resorcylic acid melting at 216\u2013217\u00b0 is 160\u2013170 g. (57\u201360 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 3)."

        "Procedure": [
            "(A) Tryptophane.\u2014In an 8-l. (2-gal.) bottle is placed 600 g. of commercial casein (coarse powder), which is then covered with about 3.2 l. of tap water at 37\u00b0 (Note 1). The bottle is shaken until all the casein is moistened. A solution of 60 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Note 2) and 6 g. of sodium fluoride (Note 3) in 1 l. of water at 37\u00b0 is added. A thin paste of 20 g. of commercial pancreatin in 100 cc. of water (37\u00b0) is poured in. The mixture is covered with a layer of toluene (80 cc.), diluted to 6 l., stoppered, shaken thoroughly, and placed in a warm room or bath at 37\u00b0.\nAfter four or five days, with daily shakings, most of the casein is in solution and chalky masses of tyrosine begin to separate. After five days, a second 20-g. portion of pancreatin in 100 cc. of water is added. After twelve days, the bottle is cooled in an icebox overnight and the undissolved material is filtered (Note 4) and reserved for the preparation of tyrosine.\nThe filtrate (6.9\u20137 l.) is measured into a 16-l. (4-gal.) stone jar, and for every liter there is added 163 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid (one volume of 95 per cent sulfuric acid and one volume of water, cooled to room temperature). The first part of the acid must be added cautiously on account of the liberation of carbon dioxide.\nThe tryptophane is precipitated by adding a solution of 200 g. of mercuric sulfate (Note 5) in a mixture of 1860 cc. of water and 140 cc. of 95 per cent sulfuric acid. After standing for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, the clear liquid is siphoned out and the yellow precipitate is filtered and washed (Note 6) with a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.9 l. of distilled water containing 20 g. of mercuric sulfate, until the filtrate is colorless and Millon's test is atypical (Note 7); about 1.5 l. is necessary. The precipitate is washed with three successive 500-cc. portions of distilled water to remove most of the sulfuric acid.\nThe moist precipitate (120\u2013130 g.) is suspended with mechanical stirring in 1.2\u20131.3 l. of distilled water, and a hot, 20 per cent aqueous solution of barium hydroxide is added until the mixture is permanently alkaline to phenolphthalein (about 120 cc. is required). A rapid stream of hydrogen sulfide is passed in with stirring until the mercury is completely precipitated (Note 8). The precipitate is filtered and washed with water until a sample of the washings gives a negative test for tryptophane with bromine water (Note 9). The barium is removed from the combined filtrate and washings by adding the exact amount of dilute sulfuric acid (Note 10) and filtering. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to about 80 cc.\nThe tryptophane is extracted from the aqueous solution by repeated shaking in a separatory funnel with 25-cc. quantities of n-butyl alcohol; water is added from time to time to keep the volume approximately constant (Note 11). The butyl alcohol extract is distilled under reduced pressure. After the water present has distilled, the tryptophane precipitates in the distilling flask and may cause bumping. When all the water has been removed, as is indicated by non-formation of drops on the side of the condenser, the distillation is stopped and, after cooling, the tryptophane is filtered and washed with a little fresh butyl alcohol. Such extractions and distillations are continued until the quantities of tryptophane obtained are negligibly small (Note 11).\nThe tryptophane so produced (7\u20138 g.) varies somewhat in quality in different runs. It is purified by recrystallization from 60 cc. of dilute alcohol (two volumes of 95 per cent alcohol to one volume of water), filtering from the hot solution an appreciable quantity of insoluble matter, and subjecting this to a second extraction with an additional 10 cc. of aqueous alcohol. The solution is decolorized by the addition of 1 g. of Norite and allowed to stand in the icebox; the silvery leaflets of tryptophane are filtered and washed successively with cold 70 per cent, 80 per cent, 95 per cent alcohol, and, finally, with a little ether. Less than half the tryptophane is obtained in each crystallization (Note 12). The yield of pure (Note 13) tryptophane is 4.0\u20134.1 g., together with under 0.1 g. of less pure product.\n(B) Tyrosine.\u2014The insoluble material (160\u2013170 g.) obtained on filtering the digestion mixture (p. 612) is suspended in 320 cc. of water and 80 cc. of 36 per cent hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is boiled gently for thirty minutes (Note 14). After straining through cheesecloth, decolorizing with 6 g. of Norite (Note 15), and filtering hot (Note 16), the warm (60\u201370\u00b0) solution is shaken with three 20-cc. portions of benzene (Note 17) and heated to boiling (Note 18). A slight excess (120\u2013150 cc.) of 28 per cent ammonia is cautiously added, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight in the icebox. The crystalline product is then filtered and washed with three 40-cc. portions of ice-water. After drying, it weighs about 23 g. The mother liquor and washings are evaporated to about 200 cc., when a second crop is obtained, weighing slightly under 1 g.\nThe combined product is suspended in 400 cc. of water and dissolved by adding 8 g. of sodium hydroxide in 20\u201330 cc. of water (Note 19); 2 g. of Norite is added, and the solution filtered. The residue is washed on the funnel with 20\u201330 cc. of hot distilled water. The filtrate is heated to boiling (Note 18) and treated with 13 cc. of hydrochloric acid (Note 20), when crystallization usually begins. The mixture is then acidified to litmus with acetic acid (Note 21) and allowed to stand overnight in the refrigerator. The resulting tyrosine is filtered and washed with ice-cold distilled water (130\u2013150 cc. is necessary) until the washings are free of chloride. The product is dried in air or in a vacuum oven. The yield is 17.0\u201318.2 g. of pure white, silky needles of tyrosine. A second crop (about 0.5 g.) of a slightly less pure product may be obtained on concentrating the mother liquor to about 120 cc."
