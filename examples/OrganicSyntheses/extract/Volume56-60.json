            "A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and an air-driven stirring apparatus. After the system has been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, it is charged with a solution of 100 g. (0.615 mole) of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (Hexamethyldewarbenzene (Note 1)) in 200 ml. of toluene. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 with a bath of ice water and stirred rapidly while a solution of 130 g. (0.640 mole) of 85% m-chloroperbenzoic acid (Note 2) in 1.5 l. of chloroform is added dropwise over 3\u20134 hours. Throughout the addition and for 4 hours following its completion the reaction mixture is kept at 0\u00b0, after which it is stirred at room temperature for 36 hours. The white precipitate that forms during the reaction (mainly m-chlorobenzoic acid) is removed by filtration through a 650-ml., sintered-glass funnel (porosity 10\u201315 \u03bcm), and the filter cake is washed with two 100-ml. portions of chloroform. Combination of the filtrates gives a chloroform\u2013toluene solution, which is condensed on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 35\u201340\u00b0. When all of the chloroform has been removed, the residual toluene solution is diluted with 500 ml. of pentane and refiltered. The filtrate is washed with four 200-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide and two 250-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 50\u00b0. Traces of toluene are removed under high vacuum (0.02 mm.) at 25\u00b0, and the residue is distilled (Note 3). Collection of material boiling between 72\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 (4 mm.) gives about 50 g. of crude product, which is further purified by dissolving it in 50 ml. of pentane and cooling the pentane solution at \u221278\u00b0 for several hours. The resulting white crystals are collected by filtration and dried, giving 31.3\u201337.5 g.

(0.250 mole) of 2-benzoyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinaldonitrile and 32 g. (29 ml., 0.25 mole) of benzyl chloride in 400 ml. of dry N,N-dimethylformamide is added dropwise over 1 hour. During addition the reaction mixture becomes dark, then fades to light brown. Ice is added as required to hold the bath temperature near \u221210\u00b0 (Note 10).\nWhen the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, maintaining a nitrogen atmosphere. Excess sodium hydride is destroyed by slow addition of 10 ml. of water. The N,N-dimethylformamide is evaporated at 40\u00b0 (0.01 mm.), and the residue is diluted with 800 ml. of toluene and 800 ml. of water. After thorough shaking, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is discarded, and the toluene layer is washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Removal of toluene under reduced pressure leaves a yellow oil, which crystallizes on standing (Note 11).\nThis material is dissolved in 500 ml. of ethanol and transferred to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask. A solution of 200 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 ml. of water is added, and the mixtured is refluxed for 2 hours. Ethanol is then removed by distillation, and the residue is shaken with 500 ml. of water and 800 ml. of toluene. The toluene layer is separated, washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, and then vigorously shaken with 600 ml. of 2 N hydrochloric acid. A portion of the 1-benzylisoquinoline hydrochloride precipitates at this point and is collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with 200-ml. portions of water and toluene. The filtrate is then transferred to a separatory funnel, the acidic layer is separated, and the crystals from the B\u00fcchner funnel are suspended in this layer. After basifying the suspension with 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide, the oil that separates is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure, leaving the crude product as a yellow oil. Distillation under reduced pressure yields 49.8 g. (91%) of pure 1-benzylisoquinoline as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 145\u2013150\u00b0 (0.01 mm.). The product solidifies on standing and may be crystallized from chloroform\u2013hexane, giving colorless prisms, m.p. 54\u201355\u00b0 (Note 12)."

(88\u201392%) of methyl (chlorosulfonyl)carbamate as white crystals, m.p. 72\u201374\u00b0 (Note 6). This material should be stored in a brown bottle protected from light (Note 7).",
            "B. Inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide. A two-necked, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a condenser to which a calcium chloride drying tube is attached. A solution of 23.0 g. (31.8 ml., 0.225 mole) of anhydrous triethylamine (Note 8) in 50 ml. of anhydrous benzene (Note 2) is placed in the flask, stirring is begun, and a solution of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of methyl (chlorosulfonyl)carbamate in 225 ml. of dried benzene (Note 9) is added dropwise over 1 hour. During addition the flask is cooled with a water bath maintained at 10\u201315\u00b0. The resulting mixture is stirred at 25\u201330\u00b0 for an additional 0.5 hour then filtered to remove triethylamine hydrochloride (13.8 g.). Evaporation of the filtrate under reduced pressure leaves 22\u201323 g. of light tan needles, m.p. 70\u201372\u00b0 (dec.), which is dissolved in 160 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 10) at 30\u00b0.

(0.0622 mole) of the inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide, and 6.0 g. (0.058 mole) of freshly distilled 1-hexanol (Note 12). After a mildly exothermic reaction (occasionally there is a 5-minute induction period), the viscous, yellow reaction mixture is heated with an oil bath at 95\u00b0 for 1 hour. The mixture is cooled to 30\u00b0, diluted with 50 ml. of water, and extracted with three 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic extracts are combined, washed successively with 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid and 50 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, dichloromethane is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residue is triturated with 50 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and filtered; the recovered solid is triturated with two further 50-ml. portions of ether. The three ethereal filtrates are combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, affording 8.0 g. of crude product. Fractionation of this oil through a short-path distillation apparatus gives 4.8\u20134.9 g. (51\u201352%) of methyl n-hexylcarbamate as a colorless oil, b.p. 59\u201360\u00b0 (0.08 mm.); nD20 1.4361 (Note 13)."

A 500-ml., three-necked flask with vertical necks is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 30-ml. water separator, to which is attached a condenser topped with an argon inlet. The flask is charged with 300 mg. (0.00158 mole) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, 270 ml. of benzene (Note 1), 33 g. (30 ml., 0.53 mole) of ethylene glycol, and 5.0 g. (0.028 mole) of 4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (Note 2), then placed under a positive pressure of argon, which is maintained throughout the reaction. Vigorous stirring is begun, and the solution is brought to reflux with an oil bath at 110\u00b0.\nAfter 20 hours at reflux, the mixture is cooled to room temperature with a water bath and poured with vigorous stirring into 500 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium carbonate contained in a 1-l. separatory funnel. The benzene layer is washed successively with two 250-ml. portions of 10% aqueous potassium carbonate and 250 ml. of brine containing potassium carbonate (Note 3), dried over sodium sulfate for 10 minutes, and filtered. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator with a 25\u201335\u00b0 water bath provides a solid yellow residue, which is dried under vacuum.\nTo obtain a crystalline product, a solution of the residue in 30 ml. of benzene containing a few drops of triethylamine (Note 4) is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, heated gently on a steam bath, and diluted with 150 ml. of hexane. Heating is continued for about 5 minutes (Note 5), after which the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, seeded, and put in a freezer at \u221215\u00b0 for at least 5 hours. The resulting solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with cold hexane, and vacuum dried, giving 5.8 g. (94%) of light cream-colored crystals, m.p. 75\u201377\u00b0.",

A 100-ml., three-necked flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with an argon inlet, a rubber septum, and a ground-glass stopper in the center neck is evacuated, flame-dried, and allowed to cool under a positive pressure of argon, which is maintained throughout the following sequence. Using a syringe, 30 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 6) and 5.0 ml. (0.029 mole) of diphenylphosphine (Note 7) are added through the septum. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled with an ice bath, and 15 ml. (0.032 mole) of cold 2.1 M n-butyllithium\u2013hexane solution (Note 8) is added by syringe over ca. 3 minutes. Stirring is continued as the red solution is allowed to warm to room temperature over about 30 minutes before 5.0 g. (0.022 mole) of 4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ethylene acetal is added through the center neck. The flask is stoppered, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.\nThe reaction mixture is then poured into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 ml. of vigorously stirred water, 10 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel. The reaction vessel and Erlenmeyer flask are rinsed with water, and the rinsings are also poured into the funnel. Alkali-insoluble impurities are removed by washing the basic aqueous phase with four 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether, which are combined and backextracted with two 50-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide. The combined aqueous layers are then put into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, cooled in an ice bath, and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to a Congo red end point. During acidification the clear yellow basic solution becomes cloudy white. This milky suspension is stirred without cooling for 3 minutes then extracted with 200 ml. of ether and two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether layers are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered.

A dry, 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mineral oil-containing liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube connected to a drying tower containing 1:1 sodium hydroxide\u2013Drierite, and an open neck that will later be connected to a rubber septum. The flask is flushed gently by passing dry nitrogen through the drying tower and gas-inlet tube as methyl acrylate (298.4 g., 331 ml., 3.47 moles) (Note 1) and anhydrous diethyl ether (2500 ml.) (Note 1) are added through the open neck. The flask is fitted with the rubber septum and then cooled to 0\u00b0 by covering three-fourths of the flask with ice in a large ice bath made from a picnic cooler insulated on top with glass wool. The gas-inlet tube is removed just long enough to permit the addition of iodine (250 g., 0.98 mole) (Note 1). The mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes and then dinitrogen tetroxide (76.6 ml., 1.24 moles) (Note 1) and (Note 2) is introduced rapidly with a syringe (Note 3) through the rubber septum. The reaction solution is stirred at 0\u00b0 for 30 hours. The solution is divided into three batches of about 1-l., which are cooled in a freezer to \u22124\u00b0. One batch at a time is removed and added to a 2-l. separatory funnel where it is washed with 80 ml. of aqueous 70% saturated sodium sulfite solution that had been precooled to \u22124\u00b0 (Note 4). The ethereal solutions are washed alternately so that each batch is exposed to room temperature for the minimum time. The sodium sulfite washes are repeated two or three times on each batch until the color of the ethereal solution remains light yellow when kept at \u22124\u00b0 (Note 5). The cooled ethereal solutions are then dried by washing each with precooled (to \u22124\u00b0) aqueous solutions containing 80 ml. of saturated sodium chloride and 15 ml. of saturated sodium sulfite. The ethereal solutions are then combined in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate at \u22124\u00b0 overnight in a freezer. The dried solution is then filtered to remove the sodium sulfate, and concentrated by evaporating it in portions in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask on a rotating evaporator fitted with a cold-finger condenser containing a dry-ice bath (Note 6). The solution should be concentrated until it contains approximately equal volumes of product and ether. The solution is then cooled to \u221278\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 6) and (Note 7), causing the separation of 403.5\u2013409 g. of ether\u2013wet crystals. The crystals are filtered and stored in a freezer, and the filtrate is eluted through a chromatographic column containing 700 g. of silica gel (Baker Analyzed, 60\u2013200 mesh, 7-cm. column diameter), using 30% diethyl ether/petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) as eluent. The solution containing the first band to be eluted, which is yellow, is evaporated on a rotating evaporator fitted with a cold finger condenser cooled with dry ice as described above. This gives a residue of 35\u201354.5 g. of yellowish crystals, which are a 7:3 mixture of methyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropionate and methyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate. The ether-wet product from the original filtration and the eluted product are combined in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask and dried at 0\u00b0 under a vacuum (0.3\u20130.5 mm.) for 3\u20134 hours, giving 396\u2013401 g. (78\u201379%), m.p. 32\u201335\u00b0, of methyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropionate containing a small amount of methyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate. This mixture may be used directly in the next step. The product can be recrystallized from 30% ether/petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) to obtain thermally unstable white plates, m.p. 33\u201335\u00b0 (Note 8).",
            "B. Methyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate. Anhydrous diethyl ether (2800 ml.) is placed in a dry 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mineral-oil, liquid-sealed, mechanical stirrer and a drying tower. The contents are cooled to 0\u00b0 by covering three-fourths of the flask with ice in a large ice bath made from a picnic cooler insulated on top with glass wool. Powdered anhydrous sodium acetate (95 g., 1.16 moles) (Note 9) is added to the flask, followed by methyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropionate (150 g., 0.579 mole). The flask that contained the ester is rinsed with cold anhydrous diethyl ether (200 ml.), which is then added to the 5-l. flask. The flask is stoppered and its contents are stirred vigorously at 0\u00b0 for 40 hours (Note 10). The flask is then removed from the ice bath and may be kept, until needed, in a freezer for 5\u20137 days. The ethereal solution is then decanted and filtered to remove the sodium acetate. The residue in the flask is rinsed with three 150-ml. portions of ether; the rinse solutions are also filtered and added to the original ethereal solution. The ethereal solution is then divided into three batches (about 1-l. each), each of which is added successively to a 2-l. separatory funnel. Each batch is washed with three 80-ml. portions of aqueous 70% saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, followed by one wash with 80 ml. of saturated brine. The ether solutions are then combined in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dried overnight over anhydrous sodium sulfate in a freezer at \u22124\u00b0. The solution is filtered to remove the drying agent and then evaporated in portions in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask on a rotating evaporator fitted with a cold-finger condenser cooled with dry ice as described in Part A. The yellow, solid residue is dissolved in a minimum of 50% diethyl ether/petroleum ether (b.p. 30\u201360\u00b0) and cooled to \u221220\u00b0 for 30 minutes (Note 7). The yellow crystals are collected by filtration and washed with cold diethyl ether. The filtrate and ether wash are concentrated and cooled to \u221270\u00b0 for 30 minutes, giving a small second crop of crystals. The combined yield of methyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate is 67\u201369 g. (88\u201391% from dried methyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropionate) as yellow plates, m.p. 33\u201335\u00b0 (Note 11). Caution! Methyl (E)-3-nitroacrylate is a potent lachrymator, like nitroolefins in general. Contact with the eyes, or accidental transfer from hands to eyes, should be avoided. If lachrymation occurs, the eyes should be washed thoroughly with water until the irritation stops."

(2.00 moles) of sodium methoxide (Note 1) is added in small portions at a rate sufficiently gradual to prevent a large exotherm (Note 2). When all of the methoxide has dissolved and the temperature has returned to 5\u00b0, the stopper is replaced with a 200-ml., pressure-equalizing, jacketed addition funnel (Note 3). This funnel, charged previously with 130 ml. (2.20 moles) of methanethiol (Note 4), contains a 2-propanol-dry ice slurry in the cooling jacket, and is topped with a silica gel drying tube. Stirring and cooling are continued while the methanethiol is run into the flask over a 20-minute period, and for 15 minutes thereafter. The jacketed addition funnel is then replaced by a standard, 200-ml., pressure-equalizing addition funnel, which is used to add 185 g.

(60 ml., 0.59 mole) of trichlorosilane (Note 3) and (Note 4), and 80 ml. of acetonitrile (Note 5). A low nitrogen flow is maintained as the mixture is stirred and heated to reflux (40\u201345\u00b0) for 1 hour or until gas evolution ceases and the carboxylic acid has dissolved. The solution is then cooled in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath to at least 0\u00b0, and the glass stopper is replaced with a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with 37.8 g. (0.264 mole) of tri-n-propylamine (Note 6) and (Note 7), which is emptied rapidly into the stirred solution. The cooling bath is removed, and the flask contents are allowed to stir until the reaction ceases to be exothermic. A heating mantle is then used to maintain reflux for 16 hours (Note 8), during which time the temperature rises to 70\u201375\u00b0.\nAs soon as reflux is terminated, the solution is poured rapidly into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, allowed to cool, and diluted with enough anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 9) to make the total volume about 850 ml. (Note 10). After the flask has been sealed and refrigerated for one hour, the precipitate is removed by rapid filtration (water aspirator) through a 150-ml. B\u00fcchner funnel and washed with three 50-ml. portions of anhydrous ether. The clear yellow filtrate is concentrated as follows. A 300-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mm. Vigreux column topped with a distillation head. The filtrate is placed in a 1-l., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel inserted into the top of the distillation head. Approximately 100 ml. is run down through the column into the flask, which is then heated. As ether is removed by distillation, the remainder of the filtrate is dripped into the flask at a constant rate, and in this way the solution is concentrated into a small flask in a continuous operation. Distillation is continued until most of the ether has been removed, and the resulting murky solution is heated at 40\u00b0 (80 mm.), removing the remaining volatiles.\nThe Vigreux column, dropping funnel, and distilling head are then replaced by a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with 100 ml. of methanol. With the top of the funnel left open to the atmosphere, the methanol is added slowly to the oily flask contents (Note 11). After vigorous boiling has ceased, the solution is heated under reflux for one hour, cooled in an ice bath, then treated slowly with a solution of 56 g. (1.0 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 25 ml. of water and 50 ml. of methanol.2 The resulting mixture is heated under reflux for 19 hours (Note 8), dissolved in 600 ml. of water, and extracted three times with 100 ml. of ether. The extracts are combined, washed once with 50 ml. of 5 N hydrochloric acid, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Ether is removed by distillation as described above, using a 300-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a 50-ml., round-bottomed distilling flask, and a 100-mm. Vigreux column. Vacuum distillation of the remaining liquid gives 12.5\u201313.4 g. (74\u201380%) of 2-methylbiphenyl, b.p. 76\u201378\u00b0 (0.5 mm.), n20D 1.5920 (Note 12) and (Note 13)."

After being stirred at 25\u201330\u00b0 for another 20 minutes, the reaction mixture is extracted successively with 500-ml. portions of water, 5% hydrochloric acid, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The aqueous phases are combined, extracted with 400 ml. of ether, and discarded. The combined organic phases are filtered through anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residual oil is distilled through a 7-cm., insulated Vigreux column (0.4 mm.). Collection of the fractions boiling below 104\u00b0 provides 191\u2013196 g. (91\u201393%) of methyl 1-cycloundecenecarboxylate (Note 7) as a pale yellow oil, most of which distils at 83\u201387\u00b0 (0.4 mm.). This ester is sufficiently pure for use in the next step.",
            "C. Cycloundecanone. In a well-ventilated hood a 3-l.; three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirrer (Note 1), a thermometer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a rubber stopper. Concentrated sulfuric acid (600 ml.) is placed in the flask, stirred slowly, and cooled to 5\u00b0 with an ice bath. Methyl 1-cycloundecenecarboxylate (191\u2013196 g., 0.91\u20130.92 mole) is added through a long-stemmed funnel, the rate of stirring is increased until the mixture becomes a homogeneous solution, and 500 ml. of chloroform is added. The resulting mixture is heated to 35\u00b0 by immersion in a warm water bath. Vigorous stirring is continued while 78 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium azide (Note 8) is added in small portions over a 30\u201350-minute period, the reaction temperature being maintained at 40 \u00b1 2\u00b0 by adding ice to the water bath. Caution! This operation should be performed behind a safety shield. After an additional 10\u201315 minutes of stirring at 35\u201340\u00b0, the reaction mixture is cooled to 5\u00b0, poured onto 1 kg. of ice, and transferred together with 1.5\u20132 l. of water to a 5-l., three-necked flask set up for steam distillation. The chloroform is distilled off and saved, and the cycloundecanone is steam distilled with 3.5\u20134.0 kg. of steam. The steam distillate is extracted with the recovered chloroform, then with 500 ml. of ether. After the ethereal extract has been washed with concentrated aqueous sodium chloride, the organic phases are filtered through anhydrous sodium sulfate, combined, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Vacuum distillation of the residual oil affords 139\u2013143 g. (83\u201385%) of cycloundecanone as a colorless or pale yellow oil, b.p. 84\u201385\u00b0 (2 mm.), n25D 1.4794\u20131.4796 (Note 8)."

            "A. Farnesyl acetate. A solution of 25 g. (0.11 mole) of farnesol (Note 1) in 40 ml. of dry pyridine (Note 2) is prepared in a stoppered, 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and 40 ml. of acetic anhydride is added in four portions over a 15-minute period. The mixture is stirred well, allowed to stand for 6 hours then poured onto 250 g. of ice. Water is added (400 ml.), and the mixture is extracted with five 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201368\u00b0). The organic extracts are combined and washed in succession with two 50-ml. portions each of water, 5% sulfuric acid, and saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (ca. 50 g.), and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 28\u201329 g. (94\u201398%) of farnesyl acetate as a colorless oil (Note 3).",
            "B. 10-Bromo-11-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrofarnesyl acetate. Farnesyl acetate (29 g., 0.11 mole) is dissolved in 1 l. of tert-butyl alcohol (Note 4) contained in a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask. Water is added (500 ml.), and the solution is cooled to about 12\u00b0 with an external ice water bath. Maintaining this temperature, rapid magnetic stirring is begun, and more water is added until a saturated solution is obtained. The second addition of water may be rapid initially, but the saturation point must be approached carefully, like the end point of a titration. A total of about 1200 ml. of water is required for the specified quantities of farnesyl acetate and tert-butyl alcohol. The solution must remain clear and homogeneous at about 12\u00b0, and if the saturation point is accidentally passed by adding too much water, tert-butyl alcohol should be added to remove the turbidity.\nExternal cooling is discontinued, and 21.4 g. (0.120 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide (Note 5) is added. Stirring is continued until all of the solid is dissolved (ca. 1 hour). The resulting solution, which may be pale yellow, is concentrated with a rotary evaporator (bath temperature 40\u201345\u00b0) to a volume of about 300 ml. and extracted with five 120-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20\u201350 g.), and removal of solvent at reduced pressure provides an oil, which is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Note 6). The pure bromohydrin acetate is obtained as a colorless oil in amounts of up to 26 g., a 65% yield based on farnesyl acetate (Note 7) and (Note 8).",
            "C. 10,11-Epoxyfarnesyl acetate. The bromohydrin acetate prepared in Part B is dissolved in 300 ml. of methanol, the solution is placed in a 500-ml. flask, and excess solid potassium carbonate (three times the molar amount of bromohydrin acetate) is added (Note 9). The mixture is stirred for 12 hours and then concentrated to ca. 100 ml. on a rotary evaporator (bath at 40\u201345\u00b0). Water is added (200 ml.), and the mixture is extracted with four 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 60\u201368\u00b0). The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (ca. 40 g.) and evaporated, leaving 10,11-epoxyfarnesol as a colorless oil (Note 10).\nThis material is acetylated with 35 ml. of pyridine and 35 ml. of acetic anhydride for 6 hours at room temperature. The mixture is poured onto 250 g. of ice and extracted with five 75-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed successively with three 10-ml. portions each of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and water then dried over magnesium sulfate. It is important not to use strong acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric to remove pyridine, as was done in Part A, since they can destroy the acid-sensitive product.\nConcentration of the ethereal solution at reduced pressure gives the epoxyacetate as a colorless oil more viscous than water. The overall yield based on farnesyl acetate is near 60% (Note 11). This material is reasonably pure if the preparation has been executed carefully, but it can be further purified by column chromatography (Note 12) or distillation (Note 13)."

A 1-l., three-necked, creased flask is fitted with a stirrer capable of forming a fine dispersion of molten sodium (Note 1), a reflux condenser, and a Hershberg addition funnel and maintained under an oxygen-free, nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is charged with 250\u2013300 ml. of dry solvent (Note 2) and 9.6\u20139.8 g. (~0.4 g.-atom) of freshly cut sodium (Note 3), (Note 4). The solvent is brought to gentle reflux, and the stirrer is operated at full speed until the sodium is fully dispersed (Note 5). The stirrer speed is then reduced (Note 6), and a mixture of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of diethyl succinate (Note 7) and 45\u201350 g. (~0.4 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 8) in 125 ml. of solvent is added over 1\u20133 hours. The reaction is exothermic, and a dark purple precipitate appears within a few minutes (Note 9). The solvent is maintained at reflux during and after the addition (Note 10). After five hours of additional stirring, the contents of the flask are cooled and filtered through a 75-mm., coarse sintered-disk funnel in a nitrogen dry-box (Note 11). The precipitate is washed several times with anhydrous diethyl ether or petroleum ether.\nThe colorless to pale yellow filtrate is transferred to a distilling flask, the solvent is evaporated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 12). After a small forerun (0.5\u20131.0 g.), 18 g. (78%) of the product is obtained at 82\u201386\u00b0 (10 mm.) as a colorless liquid, n25D 1.4331 (Note 13).\nMethod 2. The apparatus described above is charged with 4.8\u20135.0 g. (~0.2 g.-atom) of clean sodium and 8.0\u20138.2 g. (~0.2 g.-atom) of clean potassium (Note 3), (Note 4). The flask is heated with a heat gun, forming the low-melting alloy, and 300\u2013350 ml. of anhydrous ether is added from a freshly opened can. The stirrer is operated at full speed until the alloy is dispersed, then at a slower speed for the remainder of the reaction (Note 5), (Note 6). A mixture of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of diethylsuccinate (Note 7), 44 g. (0.41 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 8), and 125 ml. of anhydrous ether is added at a rate sufficient to keep the reaction under control (Note 14). The purple mixture is stirred for another 4\u20136 hours (Note 9), then filtered and washed as above in a nitrogen dry-box (Note 11). The product is distilled as above, collecting a forerun, 0.5\u20132 g. to 80\u00b0 (10 mm.), and then the product at 82\u201386\u00b0 (10 mm.) as a colorless liquid, 13.8\u201316.1 g.

The vessel is sealed and evacuated to 0.1 mm. pressure. A solution of 82 g. (1.0 mole) of cyclohexene (Note 3) in 140 ml. of anhydrous benzene is introduced by suction into the vessel. The vessel is placed in a heatable shaking device and pressured to 75 atm. with carbon monoxide; the total pressure is then increased to 150 atm. with hydrogen (Note 4). Shaking is begun and the vessel is heated to an internal temperature of 100\u00b0 (Note 5). When the internal temperature reaches 100\u00b0, the pressure begins to fall. Whenever the pressure falls to 60 atm., rocking is stopped and the pressure is first increased to 105 atm. with carbon monoxide, then to 150 atm. with hydrogen. Rocking is started again, and the process is continued until no appreciable pressure decrease occurs. Approximately 2 hours is required, and the pressure decrease corresponds to the consumption of 2 moles of gas. The vessel is rapidly cooled to room temperature (Note 6) and the residual gas is carefully vented.\nThe vessel is opened, and the slightly yellow reaction mixture is transferred immediately to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask containing a freshly prepared solution of 200 g. of sodium hydrogen sulfite in 400 ml. of water. The flask is fitted with a stopper and is occasionally shaken at room temperature for a period of 3 hours (Note 7).

After drying in air, the bisulfite derivative is transferred to a 2-l. distillation flask containing 1 l. of 20% aqueous potassium carbonate. The resulting mixture is distilled, and the azeotropic mixture of water and aldehyde (b.p. 94\u201395\u00b0) is collected under nitrogen (Note 9).\nThe aldehyde is separated from the lower aqueous layer as a colorless liquid, dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure using a Claisen distillation apparatus, yielding 92\u201394 g.

            "A. Potassium 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanolate. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped for simple vacuum distillation is charged with a solution of 25.4 g. (0.390 mole) of 86% potassium hydroxide (Note 1) and (Note 2) in 50 ml. of water, to which is added 100.0 g. (0.4098 mole) of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanol (Note 3). The colorless solution obtained is concentrated to a syrup by vacuum distillation at aspirator pressure. Further evacuation with a vacuum pump with heating to 140\u00b0 results in a white solid; under the greater vacuum volatile substances can be collected in a trap immersed in an acetone-dry ice bath. The trap must be cleaned or be replaced several times during the first hour. After drying the white solid at 140\u00b0 for 12 hours, the flask is transferred to a glove bag (Note 4) equipped with a mortar and pestle, a vacuum adapter, a powder funnel, a spatula, and a tared, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. Under a dry nitrogen atmosphere the white solid is ground to a fine powder, transferred to the 500-ml. flask, and dried on a vacuum pump (10\u22122 mm.) to constant weight, yielding 107\u2013109 g. (97\u201399%) of potassium 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanolate as a white powder.",
            "B. Bis[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethoxy] diphenyl sulfurane. Carbon tetrachloride is distilled directly from phosphorous pentoxide into a dry, 2-l., three-necked flask, fitted with stoppers, until 700 ml. is collected. The flask is quickly fitted with an adapter for use as a nitrogen-inlet, a mechanical stirrer, and an adapter for solid addition (Note 5) which is attached to the 500-ml. flask containing the potassium alkoxide from Part A. A positive pressure of dry nitrogen is used to maintain inert atmosphere conditions. A white slurry is obtained when the powdered alkoxide is added at room temperature to the stirred carbon tetrachloride. Since all of the alkoxide does not transfer, the tared, 500-ml. flask is reweighed, and the amount added to the reaction vessel is determined by difference (Note 6). The adaptor used for solid addition is quickly exchanged for a septum.\nTo a stirred suspension of 105 g. (0.372 mole) of the alkoxide, 34.7 g. (31.0 ml., 0.186 mole) of diphenyl sulfide is added by syringe. Bromine, 29.9 g. (9.6 ml., 0.186 mole), is then added by syringe over a 5-minute period, giving a red-brown mixture which gradually fades to a pale yellow within 30 minutes. Stirring is continued at room temperature for 2.5 hours, leaving a pale-yellow solution and a copious precipitate of potassium bromide containing some potassium alkoxide.\nA glove bag is equipped with a spatula, a tared, 1-l., single-necked round-bottomed flask, a 350-ml. Buchner funnel with filter paper, a 1-l. flask, a vacuum adapter, an aspirator hose (Note 7), and a flask containing 100 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride. Filtration of the reaction mixture under a nitrogen atmosphere can be achieved by pouring the solution into the filter funnel via one neck of the three-necked flask, which is inserted through a hole in the glove bag. The potassium bromide is removed and washed with two 50-ml. portions of dry carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate is then transferred to the 1-l. flask, fitted with the vacuum adapter. After removal of the sulfurane solution from the glove bag (Note 8), the flask is quickly placed on a rotary evaporator (Note 9) and concentrated to a semisolid. Drying under reduced pressure (10\u22122 mm.) for 24 hours results in crude sulfurane (115\u2013119 g., 93\u201396%) as slightly yellow crystals.\nThe flask containing the crude sulfurane is transferred to the nitrogen atmosphere of the glove bag which contains a powder funnel, a fluted filter paper, a 1-l., single-necked, round-bottomed flask, a 250-ml. graduated cylinder, a 1-l. flask containing 700 ml. of dry pentane (Note 10), and a 500-ml. flask containing 250 ml. of dry diethyl ether (Note 10). After dissolving the sulfurane in 150 ml. of ether, 500 ml. of pentane is added, giving a cloudy solution that clarifies when filtered directly into the 1-l. flask. The flask, is stoppered with the vacuum adapter and removed from the bag. At this time everything but the pentane is removed from the glove bag and the following items are added: a 600-ml., medium-frit sintered-glass funnel, a 1-l., single-necked, round-bottomed flask, a tared, 500-ml., single-necked round-bottomed flask, a vacuum adaptor, two spatulas, and a powder funnel. The sulfurane solution is concentrated to ca. 350 ml. at reduced pressure and a temperature not exceeding 40\u00b0 (Note 9), using a magnetic stirrer to prevent bumping as the solvent is evaporated through the vacuum adapter. After a drying tube is connected to the adapter, the flask is cooled in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath to induce crystallization; swirling the flask during the crystallization prevents crystals from adhering to the sides. When crystallization is complete, the flask is exchanged for the three-necked flask inserted into the side of the glove bag. Cooling in the acetone\u2013dry ice bath is continued while the neck of the flask penetrates the glove bag. The crystals, collected in the sintered-glass funnel by vacuum filtration, are washed with one 50-ml. portion of cold (\u221278\u00b0) pentane and transferred to the 500-ml. flask. After fitting with the vacuum adapter, the flask is removed from the bag and the crystals dried under reduced pressure (10\u22122 mm.) until the powdered, white sulfurane is at constant weight (76\u201379 g., 61\u201364%, m.p. 103\u2013108\u00b0). Further crystallization from the mother liquors, after concentration by rotary evaporation to one-half the original volume, gives up to 7 g. of crude sulfurane (m.p. < 95\u00b0) for a total yield of 79\u201383 g. (63\u201367%) (Note 11). Recrystallization by the same method as above gives analytically pure material, m.p. 109.5\u2013110.5\u00b0."

The cooling bath is removed so that the temperature gradually rises; at about 0\u00b0 the exothermic reaction starts. The temperature is maintained below 20\u00b0 by occasional immersion of the flask in an ice\u2013water bath; the methylenecyclopropane is allowed to reflux slowly (Note 14). After refluxing stops, the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. The 4-nitrobenzoic acid is removed by filtration and washed twice with 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers, which still contain about 10% of the total amount of 4-nitrobenzoic acid, are distilled at room temperature under reduced pressure (15 mm.) to eliminate the acid completely (Note 15). The distillate is concentrated to ca. 200 ml. of dichloromethane by distillation through a 15-cm., helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column, at a maximum oil bath temperature of 60\u00b0 (Note 16).",
            "C. Cyclobutanone (Note 16). The resulting solution of oxaspiropentane (35%) in 200 ml. dichloromethane is added dropwise at room temperature to a magnetically stirred solution containing 5\u201310 mg. of lithium iodide in 50 ml. of dichloromethane (Note 17), (Note 18), at such a rate as to maintain gentle reflux of the solvent. After the addition, when the reaction mixture returns to room temperature, the transformation into cyclobutanone is complete. The dichloromethane solution is washed with 20 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 20 ml. of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation of the solvent through a 15-cm., helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The residual liquid consists of cyclobutanone (95%) and 3-buten-2-one and 2-methylpropenal (5%).2 A final distillation at 760 mm. through a 50-cm., stainless-steel spinning band column yields 41 g. (64% from methylenecyclopropane) of pure cyclobutanone, b.p. 100\u2013101\u00b0 (Note 19), (Note 20)."

            "A. 1-Bromo-3-chloro-2,2-dimethoxypropane. In a good hood, a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser is charged with 300 ml. of anhydrous methanol, 111 g. (1.00 mole) of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene (Note 1), and a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. With stirring, 178 g. (1.00 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide is added in small portions through the condenser. After the final addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for another hour at room temperature before 5 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added to neutralize the catalyst. The solution is stirred for an additional 15 minutes and poured into a large separatory funnel containing 300 ml. of water. The lower, organic layer is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 500-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic extracts are washed twice with an equal volume of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated, giving a white semicrystalline mass, which is dissolved in refluxing pentane (250 ml.). The solution is cooled in an acetone\u2013dry-ice bath for 30 minutes, yielding 89\u201399 g. (41\u201345%) of the white crystalline ketal, m.p. 69.5\u201370.5\u00b0 (Note 2).",
            "B. 3,3-Dimethoxycyclopropene. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a thermometer, and an acetone\u2013dry-ice condenser topped with a drying tube containing sodium hydroxide pellets. An acetone\u2013dry-ice bath is placed under the flask, and ammonia is condensed into the flask from a commercial cylinder. When 350\u2013400 ml. of ammonia has condensed, the inlet tube is replaced by a stopper, and a small piece (0.5 g.) of potassium metal is added to the ammonia. The cooling bath is removed, and ca. 0.05 g. of anhydrous iron(III) chloride is added. When the ammonia reaches reflux temperature, the blue color of the dissolved potassium turns to gray, and the remainder of the potassium (11.7 g., 0.300-g.-atom total) is added in 0.5-g. pieces at such a rate that a gentle relux is maintained. The stopper is then replaced by an addition funnel containing a solution of 1-bromo-3-chloro-2,2-dimethoxypropane (21.7 g., 0.100 mole) in 50 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, which is added to the gray potassium amide\u2013ammonia suspension over a period of 15 minutes, during which time the mixture is maintained at \u221250\u00b0 to \u221260\u00b0 with the cooling bath (Note 3). After 3 hours at this temperature, solid ammonium chloride (10.8 g., 0.20 mole) is added with stirring. Ammonia is allowed to evaporate by removing the cooling bath, and during the course of the evaporation it is replaced with 350 ml. of anhydrous ether. When the reaction temperature reaches ca. 0\u00b0, the resulting brown solution is filtered from inorganic salts and placed in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask (Note 4). The ethereal solution is then subjected to a vacuum (50\u201380 mm.) applied through a carbon tetrachloride\u2013dry-ice condenser (ca. \u221225\u00b0), while the flask is immersed in an ice bath. After 4\u20135 hours, when the quantity of residue seems to remain constant, the dry-ice condenser is replaced with a distilling head. The pressure is decreased to 1\u20132 mm., the receiver is maintained at \u221278\u00b0 with a cooling bath, and distillation yields 4.0\u20136.5 g. (40\u201365%) of 3,3-dimethoxycyclopropene as a clear liquid (Note 5). This material has been purified further,2 but it can be used directly in the next step. If it is stored, it should be kept below 0\u00b0.",
            "C. Cyclopropenone. A stirred solution of 3.0 g. (0.030 mole) of 3,3-dimethoxycyclopropene in 30 ml. of dichloromethane, cooled to 0\u00b0, is treated dropwise with 5 ml. of cold water containing 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0\u00b0 for an additional 3 hours before 30 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate is added in portions, with stirring, to the 0\u00b0 solution. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is evaporated at 50\u201380 mm. with a water bath maintained at 0\u201310\u00b0. The brown, viscous residue is then distilled at 1\u20132 mm, at a water bath temperature of 10\u00b0. The distillate, a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane, is collected in a receiver cooled to \u221278\u00b0. A new receiver is attached, and the bath temperature is gradually raised to 35\u00b0 (Note 6), yielding 1.42\u20131.53 g. (88\u201394%) of cyclopropenone as a white solid, b.p. 26\u00b0 (0.46 mm.), m.p. \u221229 to \u221228\u00b0 (Note 7).\nCyclopropenone prepared in this way is quite pure and suitable for most chemical purposes. It can be repurified by crystallization from 3 volumes of ethyl ether at \u221260\u00b0 using a cooled filtering apparatus. The residual ethyl ether is then removed by evaporation at 1\u20132 mm. and 0\u00b0; very pure cyclopropenone is obtained in 60\u201370% recovery from the distilled material."

            "A. Di-tert-butyl tricarbonate. A 1-l., three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 200-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a calcium chloride-filled drying tube, and gas-inlet tube with a minimum internal diameter of 6 mm. (Note 1) extending nearly to the bottom of the flask, is dried either by heating with a free flame while passing anhydrous nitrogen through the apparatus, or by heating to 120\u00b0 for several hours in an oven. Before use, the dropping funnel should be calibrated to indicate levels corresponding to 85 ml. and 105 ml. of liquid. While an atmosphere of anhydrous nitrogen (Note 2) is maintained inside the apparatus, it is allowed to cool before a mixture of 44.8 g. (0.400 mole) of alcohol-free potassium tert-butoxide (Note 3) and 550 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 4) is added to the reaction flask. The mixture is stirred under an atmosphere of anhydrous nitrogen for 5\u201310 minutes to obtain a solution. (Note 3), (Note 5). The reaction flask is immersed in an ice\u2013salt bath maintained at \u22125\u00b0 to \u221220\u00b0, and all subsequent steps, including solvent removal, are performed with this cooling bath in place. A stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide (Note 2) is passed through the cold reaction solution for 30 minutes with vigorous stirring, resulting in the formation of a thick, creamy slurry in the reaction flask. While the reaction mixture is being saturated with carbon dioxide, 85 ml. of anhydrous benzene is added to the dropping funnel. A stream of phosgene is bubbled through the benzene until the total volume of the solution is 105 ml., corresponding to the addition of approximately 24 g. (0.24 mole) of phosgene (Note 6). When the addition of carbon dioxide is complete, the phosgene solution is added to the cold reaction slurry, dropwise and with vigorous stirring, over 1 hour, maintaining the temperature of the cooling bath at \u22125\u00b0 to \u221215\u00b0. During this addition the reaction mixture becomes less viscous but remains a white slurry. When the addition of the phosgene solution is complete, the cold reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 45 minutes while a stream of anhydrous nitrogen is passed through the reaction solution to sweep out most of the excess phosgene. The fittings are removed from the reaction flask, two of the three necks are stoppered, and the volume of solvents in the reaction flask is reduced from about 650 ml. to 100 ml. with a rotary evaporator. During evaporation the flask should be continuously cooled in an ice\u2013salt bath maintained at \u22125\u00b0 to 0\u00b0. This evaporation should be performed with either a very efficient aspirator or with a mechanical vacuum pump fitted with an efficient cold trap. Since some phosgene is still present in the reaction mixture, the exhaust from the aspirator or the vacuum pump should be discharged in the hood and any material collected in a cold trap should be emptied in the hood. The residual slurry of finely divided potassium chloride is filtered with suction in a large-diameter, fritted-glass funnel, precooled with 50 ml. of ice-cold pentane. During filtration the filter funnel may be loosely covered with an inverted large-diameter funnel through which a stream of nitrogen is passed to protect the contents of the funnel from atmospheric moisture. The residue in the reaction flask is washed into the filter funnel with 350 ml. of ice-cold pentane and washed with two additional 100-ml. portions of ice-cold pentane, leaving white potassium chloride as a residue. The combined filtrate and pentane washings are concentrated to dryness at 0\u00b0 with a rotary evaporator, under reduced pressure supplied by a vacuum pump equipped with an efficient cold trap, yielding 33.7\u201339.6 g. (64\u201375%, (Note 7)) of di-tert-butyl tricarbonate as a colorless solid. This crude product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 1250 ml. of pentane at room temperature, and cooling the solution to \u221215\u00b0. The pentane mother liquors are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, giving two additional crops of crystalline product. The total yield is 31.2\u201332.8 g. (59\u201362%) of the pure di-tert-butyl tricarbonate as colorless prisms, m.p. 62\u201363\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 8).",
            "B. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. A solution of 20.0 g. (0.0763 mole) of di-tert-butyl tricarbonate in 75 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is placed in a 600-ml. beaker fitted with a magnetic stirrer, and 0.10 g. (0.89 mmole) of freshly sublimed 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) is added (Note 9), resulting in the rapid evolution of carbon dioxide. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0 for 45 minutes, to complete the loss of carbon dioxide (Note 10), before 35 ml. of water, containing citric acid sufficient to make the aqueous layer slightly acidic, is added. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at 25\u00b0 with a rotary evaporator.

As the nitrogen atmosphere is maintained, the trichlorofluoromethane is cooled to \u221270\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath, and 119 g. (1.10 moles) of sulfur tetrafluoride (Note 2) is added from a cylinder through the gas-inlet tube (Note 3), which is then replaced with a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with a solution of 145 g. (1.00 mole) of N,N-diethylaminotrimethylsilane (Note 4) in 90 ml. of trichlorofluoromethane. This solution is added dropwise, with stirring, to the sulfur tetrafluoride solution at a rate slow enough to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture below \u221260\u00b0 (about 40 minutes). The cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually to room temperature. The apparatus is prepared for distillation with a simple distillation head, and the solvent (b.p. 24\u00b0) and by-product fluorotrimethylsilane (b.p. 17\u00b0) are distilled into a well-cooled receiver by warming the reaction mixture gently to 45\u00b0 with a heating mantle. The yellow to dark-brown residual liquid is transferred and distilled at reduced pressure through a spinning-band column, yielding 131 g. (81%) of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride as a light yellow liquid, b.p. 46\u201347\u00b0 (10 mm.) (Note 5). This product can be stored for several months at room temperature in an inert plastic bottle (such as one made of polypropylene or Teflon FEP), or for short periods of time in a dry, glass bottle."

After replacing the inlet tube with a stopper, the cooling bath is lowered but kept beneath the flask. To the slowly stirred ammonia is added 0.5 g. of hydrated iron(III) nitrate. Air, dried by passing through calcium chloride, is bubbled through the solution for about 10 seconds (Note 2) after a small piece of freshly cut sodium is added (Note 3). Once hydrogen evolution has ceased, the blue color is discharged, leaving a finely divided, black precipitate. Small pieces of freshly cut sodium are then added over a 20 minute period until 36.0 g.

The combined organic layers are filtered through glass wool to dissipate any emulsions, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered through a coarse-fritted funnel with gentle suction into a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. A magnetic stirring bar is added, and the pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure through a 20 \u00d7 2 cm. column packed with glass beads (Note 9) and fitted with a well-cooled fractionating head. With an acetone\u2013dry ice trap between the receiver and the vacuum source, the yellow residue is distilled under reduced pressure (Note 10), with rapid magnetic stirring, into dry-ice-cooled receivers, giving 1-ethoxy-1-butyne as a clear, colorless liquid at 43\u201345\u00b0 (50 mm.). A lower-boiling fraction collection at 20\u201342\u00b0 (50 mm.) is combined with any material removed from the dry-ice trap and redistilled, yielding additional product, for a total of 30.2\u201332.3 g.

A 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Dean-Stark trap is maintained under a dry nitrogen atmosphere (Note 1) and charged with 7.4 g. (0.045 mole) of 10-methyl-\u03941(9)-2-octalone (Note 2), 9.0 g. (0.15 mole) of N,N-dimethylhydrazine, 150 ml. of dry benzene, and 0.02 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid. This mixture is refluxed for 10\u201314 hours, after which time no additional water separates. Benzene and excess N,N-dimethylhydrazine are removed by simple distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure, giving 8.1 g. (87%) of the dimethylhydrazone as a pale-yellow liquid, b.p. 94\u201398\u00b0 (0.2 mm.) (Note 3), (Note 4).",
            "B. 1-Butyl-10-methyl-\u03941(9)-2-octalone. A 250-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, a 50-ml., pressure-equalizing funnel, and a rubber septum is charged with 1.4 g. (0.032\u20130.035 mole) of 55\u201360% sodium hydride dispersion in mineral oil and put under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The mineral oil is removed by washing the sodium hydride three or four times with 5-ml. portions of dry toluene (Note 5). A solution of 6.12 g. (0.0297 mole) of 10-methyl-\u03941(9)-2-octalone N,N-dimethylhydrazone in 100 ml. of dry toluene is placed in the flask, and 10 ml. of dry hexamethylphosphoric triamide is added. The rubber septum is replaced with a glass stopper. The solution is warmed with an oil bath to reflux the toluene; hydrogen evolution is observed. Reflux is maintained for 14\u201316 hours, during which time the solution becomes dark brown. The solution is then cooled to \u221210\u00b0 and 4.5 g. (0.033 mole) of 1-bromobutane in 10 ml. of dry toluene is slowly added. The solution is warmed to 60\u00b0 and maintained at that temperature for 4\u20135 hours. An abundant precipitate of sodium bromide is formed. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0, and an acetate-buffer solution (Note 6) is added. The mixture is refluxed for 4\u20135 hours to complete the hydrolysis before it is cooled and decanted. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 25-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are successively washed with three 80- to 100-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid, three 50-ml. portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, two 50-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride, and then dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents are removed by rotary evaporation (Note 7). The residue is distilled under high vacuum using a short column. After a small forerun, 4.3\u20134.7 g.

(0.200 mole) of the lithium perchlorate\u20131,2-dimethoxyethane complex (Note 2), and 16 ml. of reagent grade concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting pale-yellow to pale-tan solution is stirred continuously and heated to 63\u00b0 with an oil bath before 58.1 g. (0.80 mole) of acetone (Note 3) is added dropwise over 1 hour. During this addition the heat of reaction causes the solution to reflux, and some white solid begins to separate. After the addition is complete, stirring and heating are continued until refluxing ceases (about 30 minutes). The temperature of the bath is then raised to 78\u00b0, and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional 30 minutes.

(1.00 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate is added dropwise over 10\u201315 minutes without further heating. The temperature of the mixture is allowed to drop to 110\u2013120\u00b0 and maintained within this range while 186 g. (1.00 mole) of hexafluorobenzene (Note 2) is added dropwise over 1 hour. The dark mixture is stirred for 3 hours after the addition is complete, poured into 3 l. of ice water contained in a 5-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and acidified (Caution! Foaming) with 20% sulfuric acid. After being cooled overnight in the refrigerator, the top, aqueous layer is decanted from a lower viscous organic layer. The organic layer is dissolved in 600 ml. of diethyl ether, washed with water, and aqueous 10% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed on a rotary evaporator, affording 217 g. (78%) of dark oil which crystallizes on standing (Note 3). An analytical sample is prepared by dissolving 2 g. of the crude material in 5 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol. Hexane is added until mixture becomes turbid. Crystallization occurs when the mixture is cooled with vigorous stirring in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath. The solid is quickly collected on a B\u00fcchner funnel and transferred to a sublimator. Sublimation at 30\u00b0 (0.5\u20131.0 mm.) affords white crystals, m.p. 38\u201338.5\u00b0, of analytically pure ethyl cyano(pentafluorophenyl)acetate (Note 4).",

            "A. Ethyl N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)carbamate. A solution of 178 g. (1.00 mole) of sodium p-toluenesulfinate (Note 1) in 1 l. of water is placed in a 3-l., three-necked flask equipped with a condenser, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer. After addition of 100 ml. (108 g.) of an aqueous 34\u201337% solution of formaldehyde (ca. 1.2\u20131.4 moles) (Note 2), 107 g. (1.20 moles) of ethyl carbamate (Note 3), and 250 ml. of formic acid (Note 4), the stirred solution is heated to 70\u00b0. Soon after this temperature is reached, the reaction mixture becomes turbid due to separation of the product as oily droplets, which are kept dispersed with vigorous stirring. After heating for 2 hours at 70\u201375\u00b0, the heating mantle is replaced with an ice bath, while stirring is continued. At about 60\u00b0 the product begins to solidify. Under continued stirring the mixture is cooled further and kept in the ice bath for 2 hours after a temperature of 5\u00b0 is reached (Note 5). The precipitate is collected by suction filtration and washed three times by stirring efficiently with 400-ml. portions of cold water. After drying at 70\u00b0 to constant weight, 214\u2013232 g. (83\u201390%) (see (Note 1)) of white, microcrystalline ethyl N-(p-toluenesulfonylmethyl)carbamate, m.p. 108\u2013110\u00b0, is obtained; it is sufficiently pure for use in the next step of the reaction. Recrystallization from 95% ethanol provides colorless flasks, m.p. 109\u2013111\u00b0",
            "B. Ethyl N-nitroso-N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)carbamate. A solution of 154 g. (0.599 mole) of the ethyl N-(p-tolylsulfonylemthyl)carbamate in 600 ml. of pyridine (Note 6) is placed in a 1-l., four-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube leading into the solution, and a gas outlet leading to the exhaust. The weight of the flask together with its contents is determined, preferably on a balance placed in the same hood. The solution is cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice\u2013salt mixture. Gaseous nitrosyl chloride (Note 7) is introduced, via a mineral oil bubbler and a trap, into the stirred solution at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0. After 52\u201365 g. (0.79\u20130.99 mole) of nitrosyl chloride has been taken up (Note 8), the reaction is completed by stirring for 30 minutes at about 0\u00b0, at which point the reaction mixture is poured in a thin stream into a hand-stirred mixture of 4 l. of ice and water, giving a pale-yellow oil that readily solidifies (Note 9). The solid is collected by suction filtration after standing for 1 hour at 0\u00b0. Any lumps present are pulverized, and the solid is washed thoroughly in a beaker with four 500-ml. portions of cold water, removing pyridine. The moist product is dissolved in sufficient dichloromethane (ca. 1.5 l.) and the water layer is removed. The dichloromethane solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, giving 157\u2013171 g. (92\u2013100%) of crude ethyl N-nitroso-N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)carbamate, m.p. 86\u201389\u00b0 (slight dec.). The crude nitroso compound can be used without purification in the next step of the reaction, provided that it is free of starting material (Note 10).\nIf the nitrosocarbamate is to be stored (preferably at \u221220\u00b0) for periods longer than a month, it should be recrystallized once from 1:2 dichloromethane-diethyl ether (Note 11), m.p. 87\u201389\u00b0. In this purified form it can be stored for several months at \u221220\u00b0 without noticeable decomposition.",
            "C. p-Tolylsulfonyldiazomethane. Warning! \u03b1-Diazosulfones slowly decompose under the influence of light. Exposure to light should therefore be kept at a minimum in all stages of the reaction. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a stopper, is charged with 570 g. of alumina (Note 12). The flask is wrapped with aluminum foil or covered with dark cloth or black paper. With stirring, 1.5 l. of ether (Note 13) is added. The mixture is cooled to 10\u201315\u00b0 with a water\u2013ice bath, and a solution of 57.3 g. (0.200 mole) of ethyl N-nitroso-N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)carbamate in 150 ml. of dichloromethane (Note 14) is added in one portion. Stirring is continued for 2 hours at 10\u201315\u00b0 (Note 15); during this time the ether solution soon develops the bright-yellow color of p-tolylsulfonyldiazomethane. The ether solution is decanted from the alumina. The alumina is extracted thoroughly by stirring for periods of 5 minutes with two portions of 500 ml. and three portions of 250 ml. of ether. The combined ether solutions are filtered through coarse filter paper and concentration is a vacuum rotary flash evaporator. The temperature of the water bath must not exceed 25\u00b0. When the volume is reduced to about 200 ml., the water bath is removed entirely and concentration is continued until the cold residue crystallizes spontaneously (Note 16). The crystal mass is stirred for about 2 minutes in 50 ml. of ice-cold petroleum ether (40\u201360\u00b0). The crystals are collected on a sintered-glass filter and washed on the filter with two 25-ml. portions of cold petroleum ether. Drying overnight at 0\u00b0 in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride, yields 26\u201330 g. (66\u201376%) of yellow p-tolylsulfonyldiazomethane, m.p. 35\u201338\u00b0 (slight dec.) (Note 17). Recrystallization from anhydrous ether-pentane (Note 18) will raise the melting point to 36\u201338\u00b0 (slight dec.) at the expense of 5\u201310% of material. p-Tolylsulfonyldiazomethane should be stored at or below 0\u00b0 in the absence of light in an unsealed container (Note 19)."

The sodium p-toluenesulfinate dissolves during heating, and the clear solution is kept at 90\u201395\u00b0 for 2 hours (Note 5). The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature in an ice\u2013salt bath with continued stirring, then further cooled overnight in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0. The white solid (Note 6) is collected by suction filtration and washed thoroughly in a beaker by stirring with three 250-ml. portions of ice water.

A 3-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a 250-ml. dropping funnel, and a drying tube is charged with 107 g. (0.502 mole) of crude N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)formamide, 250 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 100 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, and 255 g. (350 ml., 2.52 moles) of triethylamine (Note 9). The stirred suspension is cooled in an ice\u2013salt bath to \u22125\u00b0. A solution of 84 g. (50 ml., 0.55 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride (Note 10) in 60 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature is kept between \u22125\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 (Note 11). During the reaction, the N-(p-tolylsulfonylmethyl)formamide gradually dissolves and triethylamine salts precipitate. Near the completion of the reaction the white suspension slowly turns brown (Note 12). After stirring for another 30 minutes at 0\u00b0, 1.5 l. of ice water is added with continued stirring. The solid material dissolves, giving a clear, dark-brown solution before the product begins to separate as a fine, brown, crystalline solid. After stirring for an additional 30 minutes at 0\u00b0, the precipitate is collected by suction filtration and washed with 250 ml. of cold water. The wet product is dissolved in 400 ml. of warm benzene (40\u201360\u00b0), the aqueous layer is removed with a separatory funnel, and the dark-brown benzene solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the magnesium sulfate, 2 g. of activated carbon (Note 13) is added, and the mixture is heated at about 60\u00b0 for 5 minutes and filtered (Note 14). One liter of petroleum ether (b.p. 40\u201360\u00b0) is added to the filtrate with thorough swirling. After 30 minutes the precipitate is collected by suction filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator, yielding 74\u201382 g.

A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, and a reflux condenser is charged with 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid and then, cautiously, 100 g. of sodium hydroxide pellets. After the pellets have dissolved, 100 g. (0.565 mole) of 7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one is added and the solution is maintained at reflux under nitrogen for 8 hours. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the mixture is about pH 1; approximately 125 ml. of acid is required. After the addition of 1 l. of benzene, the mixture is filtered and the solid sodium chloride is washed with three 100-ml. portions of benzene. The two phases of the filtrate are separated, and the aqueous phase is transferred to a magnetically stirred, 1-l., continuous extractor (Note 8). The combined benzene phase is transferred to a 2-l. pot connected to the extractor, and the aqueous phase is extracted for 13 hours. Following distillation of the benzene, the remaining orange liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 30-cm. Vigreux column, removing acetic acid. When tropolone begins to distill into the column, the condenser is replaced with a two-necked flask immersed in ice water. With vacuum applied through one neck of this receiver, tropolone distills at 60\u00b0 (0.1 mm.) and is collected as a crude yellow solid, 66.4 g. (96%). A solution of the impure product in 150 ml. of dichloromethane is diluted with 600 ml. of pentane, 4 g. of activated carbon is added, and the mixture is heated to boiling.

(77%) (Note 9), is collected as white needles, m.p. 50\u201351\u00b0, by filtration. Evaporation of the filtrate to dryness, dissolution of the residue in 800 ml. of pentane, treatment with activated carbon, and cooling to \u221220\u00b0 yields an additional 8 g.

            "A. 2,4-Dibromo-3-pentanone (1). A three-necked, 250-ml. flask is fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Bromine (160 g., 1.00 mole) is added rapidly to a stirred solution of 45 g. (0.52 mole) of 3-pentanone (Note 1) and 1 ml. of phosphorus tribromide maintained between \u221210\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 with an acetone\u2013dry ice bath in an efficient hood. Toward the end of the reaction very large amounts of hydrogen bromide are evolved, and the rate of addition must be controlled to allow the hood to exhaust the gas. Alternatively, a gas trap may be used. Depending on the efficiency of the hood, the addition should take 20\u201340 minutes. The flask is then evacuated with a water pump, removing dissolved hydrogen bromide, and the reaction mixture is immediately fractionally distilled through a 40-cm. column packed with glass helices (or, more quickly, with a Dufton column)2 under reduced pressure. The dibromoketone 1, a mixture of dl- and meso-isomers,3 distills at 67\u201382\u00b0 (10 mm.), and 91 g. (72%) of product is collected as a colorless liquid (Note 2).",

A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 100-ml. dropping funnel having a nitrogen inlet tube, a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and an efficient double-surface condenser carrying a nitrogen outlet tube connected to a bubbler, and placed on a combined hotplate\u2013magnetic stirring unit in a heat-resistant glass dish, acting as a water bath. Dry acetonitrile (200 ml.) (Note 3) is introduced into the flask, followed by 90 g. (0.60 mole) of dried powdered sodium iodide (Note 4), with vigorous stirring under a slow stream of nitrogen. When the stirring bar rotates steadily, 20 g. (0.31 g.-atom) of powdered copper bronze (Note 5) is added, followed by 28 g. (30 ml., 0.41 mole) of freshly-distilled furan (Note 6). The dropping funnel is then charged with a solution of 24.4 g. (0.100 mole) of dibromoketone 1 in 50 ml. of dry acetonitrile, which is rapidly added to the stirred reaction mixture (Note 7). On addition of dibromoketone 1, the temperature rises to 45\u201350\u00b0, and a characteristic oatmeal-colored precipitate forms. After about 2 hours the temperature begins to drop, and the reaction is maintained at 50\u201360\u00b0 with the water bath for a total reaction time of 4 hours (Note 8).\nThe flask is cooled to 0\u00b0 with crushed ice (Note 9), and 150 ml. of dichloromethane is added with stirring. The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-l. beaker containing 500 ml. of water and 500 ml. of crushed ice; material remaining in the flask is rinsed into the beaker with 10 ml. of dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred thoroughly, further salts being precipitated, until the ice just melts, and filtered into a cooled filter flask under reduced pressure through a sintered or B\u00fcchner funnel and a kieselguhr filter-aid cake (Note 10). The beaker and filter cake are washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the clear combined filtrate is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel while still cold (Note 11).\nThe mixture is shaken vigorously, the lower layer is separated and stored in ice, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two, 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined, organic extracts are shaken with 100 ml. of ice-cold, concentrated aqueous ammonia (35% w/w) filtered through a filter-aid cake, and separated (Note 12). The extraction and filtration are repeated with fresh ammonia solution using the same filter (Note 13). The filter is washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the organic layer is separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dried solution is filtered, the filter is washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 30\u00b0. The flask containing the residual oil is cooled to 0\u00b0 before exposure to air (Note 14).\nThe light-yellow oil is dissolved in 60 ml. of 30% anhydrous diethyl ether in pentane and treated with 2 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and 0.5 g. of decolorizing carbon. The mixture is swirled for a few minutes, allowed to settle, and filtered by gravity through three sheets of fine filter paper into a 100-ml., round-bottomed flask with a 14/20 joint. The filter is washed with 10 ml. of pentane, and the flask is sealed by wiring on a 14-mm. serum cap. The flask is placed on a cork ring, lowered into an insulated container (large Dewar bottle, styrofoam box, etc.) half filled with dry ice, and cooled slowly to \u221278\u00b0. When recrystallization is complete, a nitrogen supply is connected to the flask via a syringe needle; the supernatant liquid is then withdrawn by syringe and replaced with 50 ml. of pentane, previously cooled to \u221278\u00b0.\nThe flask is swirled, washing the crystals (Note 15), and the pentane is withdrawn. The flask is connected to a vacuum (water pump) via the nitrogen inlet and warmed to room temperature. The crude cycloadduct 2 (6.1\u20137.3 g., 40\u201348%) is isolated as colorless needles, m.p. 43.5\u201345\u00b0, from the first recrystallization (Note 16). Pure 2\u03b1,4\u03b1-dimethyl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one (2) can be obtained by recrystallization from pentane at \u221278\u00b0 with minimal loss, m.p. 45\u201346\u00b0 (Note 17)."

The mixture is poured into 800 ml. of water and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether layers are discarded, and the aqueous layer is made alkaline with sodium hydroxide pellets (60\u201365 g. is needed). The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, the combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the drying agent is removed by filtration.

A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a dropping funnel is flushed with nitrogen or argon and charged with 32.3 g. (35.1 ml., 0.320 mole) of N-methylmorpholine (Note 2). The flask is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 75\u00b0, and 32.4 g. (29.1 ml., 0.286 mole) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise over a period of 2.5 hours (Note 3). The mixture is stirred for 20 hours at 75\u00b0, at which time a negative peroxide test (potassium iodide paper) is obtained (Note 4). The reaction mixture is cooled to 50\u00b0, and a slurry of 50 ml. of methanol, 0.5 g. of charcoal, and 0.5 g. of Celite (Note 5) is added. After being stirred for 1 hour, the mixture is filtered and the filter cake washed with three 15-ml. portions of methanol. The filtrate and combined washings are concentrated with a rotary evaporator (water aspirator vacuum), with the bath temperature finally reaching 95\u00b0, where it is held for 10 minutes. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the residual viscous oil is dissolved in 25 ml. of acetone at 60\u00b0. On cooling to 40\u00b0 (with seeding, if crystals of the N-oxide are available) the product spontaneously crystallizes. The slurry is stored at room temperature overnight, cooled in an ice bath, and filtered. The crystals are washed with three 15-ml. portions of 0\u00b0 acetone and dried overnight at 40\u00b0 (0.01 mm.) The yield of colorless crystalline monohydrate 1 is 32.4\u201334.3 g.

(10.1 ml., 0.100 mole) of cyclohexene (Note 9). This two-phase solution is stirred vigorously under nitrogen at room temperature. The reaction is slightly exothermic and is maintained at room temperature with a water bath. During the overnight stirring period, the reaction mixture becomes homogeneous and light brown in color. After 18 hours, TLC (Note 10) shows the reaction to be complete. Sodium hydrosulfite (0.5 g.) (Note 11) and 5 g. of Magnesol (Note 12) slurried in 20 ml. of water are added, the slurry is stirred for 10 minutes, and the mixture is filtered through a pad of 5 g. of Celite on a 150-ml. sintered-glass funnel. The Celite cake is washed with three 15-ml. portions of acetone. The filtrate, combined with acetone wash, is neutralized to pH 7 with 6.4 ml. of 12 N sulfuric acid. The acetone is evaporated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator. The pH of the resulting aqueous solution is adjusted to pH 2 with 2.3 ml. of 12 N sulfuric acid, and the cis-diol 2 is separated from N-methylmorpholine hydrosulfate by extraction with five 45-ml. portions of n-butanol (Note 13). The combined butanol extracts are extracted once with 25 ml. of 25% sodium chloride solution, and the aqueous phase is backwashed with 50 ml. of butanol.

(0.12 mole) of 2-bromobenzoic acid (Note 4), and 1.0 g. of copper(I) bromide (Note 5). The mixture is thoroughly purged with dry nitrogen and stirred rapidly while 9.0 g. (0.47 mole) of an 80% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil (Note 6) is slowly added portionwise through the inlet protected by the calcium chloride drying tube. Addition of the first portions of the sodium hydride results in an immediate exothermic reaction, and the temperature of the mixture rises rapidly to 50\u201355\u00b0. The remainder of the sodium hydride is added at such a rate that the temperature remains within the 50\u201355\u00b0 range; external cooling with a cold-water bath may be necessary (Note 7). After addition of the sodium hydride is complete (30\u201335 minutes), the flask is placed in a hot-water bath heated to 80\u201385\u00b0, and the reaction mixture is stirred and heated for 5 hours, during which time a slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the apparatus.\nWhen the reaction mixture has cooled, the contents of the flask are poured into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml. of distilled water. The reaction flask and stirrer are thoroughly washed with an additional 100 ml. of distilled water, with the washings added to the bulk of the reaction mixture. The aqueous mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to ensure completion of hydrolysis and precipitation of inorganic salts. After the salts are removed by filtration under reduced pressure (Note 8) and discarded, the filtrate is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and the excess acetylacetone is separated (Note 9). The aqueous phase is washed with five 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether (Note 9) and transferred to a 1-l. conical flask. Nitrogen is blown through the solution for 15 minutes to remove traces of ether (Note 10). The aqueous solution is then acidified to pH 3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, with the flask being constantly swirled during addition of the acid, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to ensure complete precipitation of the product. The crude material is collected by filtration under reduced pressure, washed with 25 ml. of distilled water, and dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide, giving 21\u201322 g. (76\u201380%) of crude product, m.p. 138\u2013145\u00b0 (Note 11). Recrystallization from a mixture of 50 ml. of methanol and 100 ml. of water gives 19.5\u201321 g.

(0.05 mole) of ethyl nitrite (Note 1), 4 g. of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 2), and 2.35 g. (0.0331 mole) of pyrrolidine (Note 3). The stopcock is closed (Note 4), and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 days. Excess ethyl nitrite, tetrahydrofuran, and the ethanol formed are removed from the N-nitrosopyrrolidine (Note 5) by stirring at 25\u00b0 under reduced pressure (10 mm., water aspirator, (Note 6) for 2 hours. The stopcock is fitted with a rubber septum, the air in the system is replaced with dry argon (Note 4) and (Note 7)), and 50 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is injected by syringe. A solution of lithium diisopropylamide is prepared in a separate, dry, 100-ml. flask by adding 21.1 ml. (0.0340 mole) of a 1.61 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane (Note 8) to a solution of 3.44 g. (4.76 ml., 0.0341 mole) of diisopropylamine (Note 9) in 25 ml. of tetrahydrofuran at \u221278\u00b0 (methanol\u2013dry ice bath) with stirring under argon. The solution is warmed to 0\u00b0 in 15 minutes, then added dropwise with a syringe within 4 minutes to the nitrosamine solution, stirred at \u221278\u00b0. Stirring of the yellow to orange solution is continued at this temperature for 25 minutes. A solution of 5.46 g. (0.0300 mole) of benzophenone in 12 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise by syringe (Note 10), and the mixture is stirred for 12 hours at \u221278\u00b0, then warmed to 0\u00b0 within 2 hours. After addition of 0.6 ml. (0.03 mole) of water, the flask is transferred from the argon line to a rotary evaporator (within the hood). Solvents and diisopropylamine are removed under reduced pressure in a 40\u00b0 bath (Note 11). The remaining solid is dissolved with slight warming in 120 ml. of dry methanol (Note 12), before 3.9 g. (66 equivalents) of Raney nickel (Note 13) is rinsed into the solution with 30 ml. of dry methanol. The reaction vessel is equipped again with the three-way stopcock, and the air in the flask is replaced with hydrogen (Note 7). The flask is filled five times with hydrogen from a balloon; during this operation vigorous stirring of the Raney nickel\u2013methanol suspension is necessary. The flask is attached to a mercury bubbler to maintain a positive hydrogen pressure (200 mm.) supplied from a cylinder, as shown in Figure 1. The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hours at room temperature while a slow stream of hydrogen is passed through the system. The major part of the solution is decanted and filtered, and the remaining Raney-nickel suspension is extracted by refluxing three times for 10 minutes each with 20 ml. of methanol (Note 14). The combined methanol solutions are concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 150 ml. of diethyl ether and 100 ml. of water, the layers are separated (Note 15), and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with 50-ml. portions of ether.

Dry hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled into the solution with stirring until the mixture is acidic, The almost colorless precipitate of the hydrochloride is filtered, washed two times with 30-ml. portions of dry ether, and dried in a desiccator under reduced pressure for 3 hours, giving 5.99\u20136.11 g. (58\u201360%, based on benzophenone) of the product, m.p. 244\u2013249\u00b0 (dec.). Recrystallization from methanol\u2013acetone gives 5.06\u20135.20 g. (58\u201360%) of analytically pure product, m.p. 267\u2013269\u00b0 (dec.) (Note 16). The free base is obtained by treatment of the hydrochloride with 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide and extraction with ether, m.p. 82\u201383\u00b0 (Note 17).\nFigure 1."

After the flask has cooled to room temperature, the rate of nitrogen flow is reduced, and 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether (Note 1) and approximately 5 ml. of a solution of 68.5 g. (0.500 mole) of 1-bromobutane (Note 2) in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature, and within a few minutes an exothermic reaction begins. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and the remaining ether solution is added dropwise over ca. 1 hour. After addition is complete, the mixture is refluxed with stirring for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature.\nA 1-l., three-necked flask, equipped in the same manner, is charged with ca. 0.25 g. (ca. 0.5 mmole) of dichloro[1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) (Note 3), 29.5 g. (0.201 mole) of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Note 4), and 150 ml. of anhydrous ether (Note 5). The Grignard reagent prepared above is transferred to the dropping funnel and added over 10 minutes, with stirring, to the mixture cooled in an ice bath. The nickel complex reacts immediately with the Grignard reagent, and the resulting clear-tan reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, with stirring. An exothermic reaction starts within 30 minutes, and the ether begins to reflux gently. After stirring for 2 hours at room temperature, most of the magnesium bromochloride salt has deposited (Note 6). The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 6 hours, cooled in an ice bath, and cautiously hydrolyzed with 2 N hydrochloric acid (ca. 250 ml.) (Note 7). The nearly colorless organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted with two 70-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layer and extracts are washed successively with water, aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and again with water, dried over anhydrous calcium chloride, and filtered. After evaporation of the solvent the residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 25-cm. column packed with glass helices, giving a forerun (ca. 4 g.) of 1-butyl-2-chlorobenzene, b.p. 52\u201354\u00b0 (3.5 mm.), nD20 1.5110, followed by 30.0\u201331.5 g.

As a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the system, the condenser is charged with dry ice and 2-propanol, the funnel is briefly removed, about a liter of liquid ammonia is added straight from a commercial cylinder (Note 2), and the funnel is replaced. Bright, freshly-pared sodium metal (11.8 g., 0.513 g.-atom) is added, turning the mixture blue. Diethyl phosphonate (70.4 g., 0.510 mole) (Note 3) is cautiously added dropwise to the sodium in ammonia in the manner of a titration; the endpoint is the change from blue to colorless (Note 4). Iodobenzene (52.4 g., 0.257 mole) (Note 5) is slowly added, giving the solution a slight yellowish tint (Note 6). The dropping funnel is replaced by a stopper, the frost is wiped off the outside of the flask with a towel dampened with acetone, and the whole system is mounted in a photochemical reactor of adequate design (Note 7). Caution! The lamps must be shielded to prevent exposure of the eyes or skin to ultraviolet radiation. The flask is irradiated for 1 hour (Note 8), but every 20 minutes the lamps are shut off briefly while the exterior of the flask is freed of frost by spraying it, still mounted in the reactor, with 2-propanol from a wash bottle.\nAfter irradiation, the flask is removed from the reactor, and about 50 g. (0.62 mole) of solid ammonium nitrate is added with stirring to acidify the mixture. About 200 ml. of diethyl ether is added, nitrogen flow is stopped, the condenser is removed, and the open flask is placed on a cork ring in an operating hood and allowed to stand overnight while the ammonia evaporates. The next day 300 ml. of water (Note 9) and 300 ml. of ether are added, the ether layer is separated, the water layer is extracted twice with ether, and the combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the ethyl ether, the residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a short Vigreux column. After a small forerun, 50.3\u201356.1 g.

A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer is charged with the crude thiosulfate solution 1 and cooled to 0\u00b0 with the aid of an ice-salt bath. The cold thiolate solution 2 is added rapidly, with vigorous stirring for 3 minutes, followed by 200 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride (Note 8), and the mixture is warmed to 5\u00b0. Stirring is stopped after 10 minutes, counted from the start of the addition of the aqueous sodium chloride. The crude disulfide 3, which separates as an oil, is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 250-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The extracts are combined with the oil, washed twice with 150-ml. portions of water, dried briefly over granular calcium sulfate, and filtered through a glass-wool plug. Removal of the solvent leaves 125\u2013133 g. of crude disulfide 3 (Note 9). Distillation of this material at 44.5\u201345\u00b0 (1.25 mm.) gives 118\u2013123 g.

After the reaction has begun (Note 4), the addition rate is regulated, maintaining a gentle reflux during the remainder of the addition period. The mixture is heated at reflux for an additional hour, and a solution of 108 g. (0.995 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane (Note 5) in 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise while the reaction is maintained at reflux with continued heating and stirring (Note 6). The suspension is stirred for another 2 hours under reflux, then cooled to room temperature and stirred overnight.\nThe condenser and dropping funnel are removed, and the flask is equipped for distillation with a 30.5-cm.

(0.38 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings and 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran (Note 1) and (Note 2). About 2 g. of 1,2-dibromoethane is added, initiating the formation of the Grignard reagent. When the supernatant solution becomes warm and begins to reflux from reduction of 1,2-dibromoethane, a solution of 50 g. (0.28 mole) of silane 2 in 75 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise to the stirred mixture at a rate that maintains gentle reflux. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is kept at reflux for an additional hour before freshly distilled acetaldehyde (25.0 g., 0.568 mole) is introduced. The temperature is maintained at reflux, and stirring is continued throughout the addition and for an additional hour. The flask is then fitted with a distillation head and heated until ca. 100 ml. of distillate has been collected. The reaction mixture is cooled (ice-water bath) and stirred, diluted with 100 ml. of ether, and hydrolyzed by addition of enough saturated ammonium chloride (approximately 50 ml.) to dissolve the thick, sticky precipitate. The salts are filtered and washed with ether, and the aqueous layer of the filtrate is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure (Note 12), giving 48\u201355 g. of crude butenol 3 as a liquid that is used in the next step without further purification.",

The resulting straw-yellow solution of lithium dimethylcuprate is cooled to \u221278\u00b0 in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath, and a solution of 1.10 g. (0.0100 mole) of 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone (Note 4) in 10 ml. of ether is injected into the flask, with stirring, over a 2\u20133 minute period. The cooling bath is allowed to warm slowly to about \u221220\u00b0 over ca. 1 hour (Note 5) before a solution of 2.13 g. (0.0150 mole) of 3-trimethylsilyl-3-buten-2-one (Note 6) in 10 ml. of ether is added dropwise over 5 minutes.

            "A. trans-2,4-Pentadienoic acid. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser cooled with ice-cold water (Note 1) bearing a calcium chloride drying tube, and a powder funnel. The flask is charged with 206 g. (210 ml., 2.61 moles) of pyridine (Note 2), and with vigorous stirring 208 g. (2.00 moles) of powdered malonic acid (Note 3) is added in portions. The powder funnel is replaced by a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 126 g. (150 ml., 2.25 moles) of acrolein (Note 4), which is added, with vigorous stirring, over a 30-minute period. The exothermic reaction begins immediately with evolution of carbon dioxide, and the gently refluxing mixture becomes homogeneous. After 1 hour, as carbon dioxide evolution ceases, the solution is poured onto 1 l. of ice in a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and carefully acidified with 130 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of dichloromethane, and the organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate for ca. 10 minutes. The dichloromethane solution is concentrated to ca. 300 ml. on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 20\u201330\u00b0 and allowed to crystallize in a freezer at \u221210\u00b0 for several hours. After a first crop, yielding 40\u201350 g. of product, m.p. 72\u201373\u00b0, is collected, three additional crops are taken following successive concentration of the mother liquor to 150, 70, and 30 ml. Dried under reduced pressure in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide, the four crops of off-white crystals total 82\u201390 g. (42\u201346%), m.p. 69\u201371\u00b0 (Note 5).",
            "B. Benzyl trans-1,3-butadiene-1-carbamate. Caution! The following reaction should be carried out in a fume hood to avoid accidental exposure to toxic hydrazoic acid.\nA dry, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a nitrogen inlet. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 49 g. (0.50 mole) of trans-2,4-pentadienoic acid, 80 g. (0.62 mole) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and 300 ml. of acetone (Note 6). The resulting solution is stirred and cooled to 0\u00b0 in an ice\u2013salt bath. A solution of 55 g. (0.51 mole) of ethyl chloroformate in 150 ml. of acetone is added over 30 minutes while the temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0 (Note 7). Stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes at 0\u00b0, after which a chilled solution of 65 g. (1.0 mole) of sodium azide (Note 8) in 170 ml. of water is added over a 20-minute interval, keeping the temperature below 0\u00b0. The contents of the flask are stirred for an additional 10\u201315 minutes at 0\u00b0 (Note 9) and poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel containing 500 ml. of ice-water. The acyl azide is isolated by extraction with six 250-ml. portions of toluene. The combined toluene extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 20 minutes and concentrated to a volume of ca. 300 ml. on a rotary evaporator at a water bath temperature of 40\u201350\u00b0 (Note 10). Caution! The acyl azide is potentially explosive. The solution should not be evaporated to dryness. While the toluene solution is being concentrated, a dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a simple distillation head, and a heating mantle is charged with 43 g. (0.40 mole) of benzyl alcohol, 250 mg. of 4-tert-butylcatechol (Note 11), and 200 ml. of toluene. About 30 ml. of toulene is distilled from the flask to remove trace amounts of water, and the distillation head is replaced with a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The toluene solution is stirred and heated at a rapid reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere as the toluene solution of the acyl azide is added over 30 minutes. The disappearance of the acyl azide and isocyanate is followed by IR analysis (Note 12). Conversion to the carbamate is complete in 10\u201330 minutes, after which the solution is cooled rapidly to room temperature by immersing the flask in an ice bath. The toluene is rapidly removed on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 40\u201350\u00b0, producing a yellow solid residue (Note 13) which is dissolved in 50 ml. of 95% ethanol and allowed to crystallize in a freezer at \u221225\u00b0 for several hours. Two crops of pale yellow crystals, m.p. 69\u201372\u00b0, are isolated which total 39\u201346 g. after drying under reduced pressure. Concentration of the mother liquor affords an oily residue that is placed on a 6 \u00d7 80-cm. column packed with 500 g. of silica gel (Note 14) and eluted with 1:9 (v/v) ethyl acetate\u2013hexane. An additional 11\u201312 g. of crystalline product is obtained from the chromatography, raising the total yield to 50\u201358 g. (49\u201357%) of nearly pure benzyl trans-1,3-butadiene-1-carbamate, a pale yellow solid, m.p. 70\u201373\u00b0 (Note 15)."

The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 hours, after which 150 ml. of dry, low-boiling petroleum ether (Note 9) is added to complete the precipitation of triethylamine hydrochloride (Note 10). The mixture is quickly filtered under nitrogen (Note 11) into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask through an Iena sintered-glass filter. A 300-ml. portion of petroleum ether is used to wash the flask and the triethylamine hydrochloride on the filter. The solvent is removed by distillation under nitrogen. Further distillation through a Vigreux column under nitrogen gives 93\u2013103 g. (69\u201377%) of 1-chloro-N,N,2-trimethylpropenylamine, b.p. 125\u2013130\u00b0 (760 mm.) (Note 12) and (Note 13). The compound is very sensitive to humidity and should be immediately stored in ampoules (Note 14)."

(0.100 mole) of hexachlorobenzene (Note 2). The apparatus is flushed with argon or nitrogen (Note 3) before 600 ml. of dry diethyl ether (Note 4) is added. The resulting suspension is stirred and cooled to \u221272\u00b0 to \u221278\u00b0 in a 4-l. acetone\u2013dry ice bath. A solution of n-butyllithium (0.110 mole) in hexane (Note 5) is added over a 30-minute period such that the temperature does not exceed \u221270\u00b0 (Note 6). The mixture is then allowed to warm to \u221260\u00b0 over an additional 1.5 hours. Four liters of dry, thiophene-free benzene (Note 4) is added to the pentachlorophenyllithium solution (Note 7) over a 1-hour interval, during which the temperature rises to ca. + 10\u00b0 (Note 8). The mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of at least 14 hours and then is heated at +30\u00b0 for another 2 hours to ensure complete reaction (Note 9). A 10-g. portion of solid ammonium chloride is added, and 15 minutes later the contents of the flask are filtered through 20 g. of Celite. The volume of the filtrate is reduced to 75 ml. with a rotary evaporator, and 100 g. of alumina (Note 10) is added to the concentrate in a 250-ml. flask. The rotary evaporation is continued until the weight remains constant and a free-flowing consistency is attained. The material is placed on a column packed with 800 g. of alumina and eluted with low-boiling petroleum ether (Note 11). Fractions of ca. 200 ml. are collected and analyzed by GC or TLC ((Note 6)), with the appropriate fractions combined and evaporated, providing 16.9\u201317.5 g.

            "A. Disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate (Note 1). A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Note 2), a three-way stopcock with one branch connected to a nitrogen source, and a Y-shaped adapter fitted with a reflux condenser vented through an oil bubbler and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped by a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen (Note 3) for 15 minutes and charged with 600 ml. of dry, deoxygenated dioxane (Note 4) and (Note 5), 10.6 g. (0.461 g.-atoms) of sodium, and 9.1 g. (0.050 mole) of benzophenone. The solution is stirred vigorously and heated under reflux with a heating mantle until the deep blue color of the benzophenone ketyl appears. With a gas-tight syringe, 45.3 g. (29.8 ml., 0.231 mole) of iron pentacarbonyl (Note 6) is injected into the dropping funnel. The blue solution is then titrated to a white or slightly yellow end point by adding iron pentacarbonyl to the refluxing solution over 2.5 hours (Note 7). The suspension is heated at reflux for another 45 minutes, then cooled to room temperature. Precipitation of the disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate as a white powder is completed by adding 600 ml. of dry, deoxygenated hexane (Note 5) and (Note 8). The Y-shaped adapter and the mechanical stirrer are removed under a rapid stream of nitrogen and quickly replaced with a tight-fitting rubber septum and a gas-dispersion tube with a fritted-glass tip (see Figure 1). The solvent is forced up the gas-dispersion tube and out of the flask with nitrogen pressure (Note 9). The product is washed in the flask with two 400-ml. portions of hexane added via a cannula (Note 5), and the supernatant solvent is removed with nitrogen pressure in the same manner. The disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate is used directly in Parts B and C without drying or weighing (Note 10).\nFigure 1.",
            "B. Methyl 7-oxoheptanoate. In the same three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 72\u201378 g.

The light tan suspension is stirred vigorously as 41.8 g. (0.200 mole) of methyl 6-bromohexanoate (Note 12) is added in one portion by syringe. The nitrogen is flushed from the flask with carbon monoxide (Note 13) and (Note 14) admitted through the other branch of the three-way stopcock, and the suspension is stirred under 10 p.s.i. of carbon monoxide for at least 14 hours, during which time the solid dissolves. A rapid flow of nitrogen is swept through the flask while the septum is removed and replaced quickly with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid, added dropwise to the orange solution (Note 15). Stirring is continued for 20 minutes, after which the deep red solution is concentrated to a volume of ca. 400 ml. with a rotary evaporator in the hood (Caution! Some iron pentacarbonyl is present) and poured into 2 l. of water. The mixture is extracted with four 400-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic solutions are washed with 400 ml. of water. The ethereal solution is mixed with 400 ml. of 2 M hydrochloric acid, and 68 g. of iron(III) chloride is added in small portions until carbon monoxide evolution subsides and the organic layer becomes green from triiron dodecacarbonyl. The organic layer is washed with successive 400-ml. portions of 2 M hydrochloric acid, water, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and saturated sodium chloride. After being dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the ethereal solution is concentrated to a green oil with a rotary evaporator. Iron-containing by-products such as triiron dodecacarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl are removed by rapid chromatography on a 7 \u00d7 40 cm. column prepared in hexane with 400 g. of silica gel (Note 16). The green triiron dodecacarbonyl is first eluted with ca. 3 l. of hexane before the product is eluted with 3 l. of 2:1 (v/v) ether\u2013hexane. The ether\u2013hexane eluate is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated. Distillation of the residual oil through a 15-cm.

(0.200 mole) of methyl 6-bromohexanoate (Note 12) is injected into the dropping funnel with a gas-tight syringe and added dropwise into the flask. The resulting solution (Note 19) is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and cooled in an ice bath before 64 g. (28 ml., 0.45 mole) of methyl iodide is added over 20 minutes. The ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 20\u201340 hours (Note 14). The dark-red mixture is poured into 3 l. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and extracted with three 400-ml. portions of ether and one 400-ml. portion of hexane.

The thermometer and mechanical stirrer are replaced with ground-glass plugs (Note 8), and the condenser is replaced with a 1-l., 90-mm., medium-porosity fritted-disk nitrogen pressure funnel attached to a 1-l., round-bottomed, two-necked flask fitted with a three-way stopcock on the side arm (Figure 1). All joints are either clamped or taped together, and the apparatus is carefully inverted, pouring the slurry into the funnel. The mixture is filtered with nitrogen pressure into the 1-l. receiving flask (Note 9), which is maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solid filter cake is rinsed with three 50-ml. portions of 4:1 (v/v) ether\u2013dioxane injected with a long needle syringe through the three-way stopcock. The four-necked flask is rinsed by manipulation of the needle, and the apparatus and the solids are dispersed in each rinse. The pale-yellow filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure with a warm water bath at 40\u00b0, and the powdery white solid is dried at 10-mm. pressure for 4 hours at 25\u00b0, yielding 38.3\u201348.8 g. (63\u201380%) of bis(pentafluorophenylcopper)dioxane complex (Note 10). The color of this dioxane complex varies from tan to white. The complex is transferred to a 200-ml., round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is evacuated to a pressure of 0.001 mm., immersed in an oil bath, and slowly heated to 100\u00b0 over 1 hour (Note 11). The temperature is slowly and constantly increased to 128\u00b0 during a second hour and maintained at 128\u00b0 for 4 hours (Note 12). Pure pentafluorophenylcopper tetramer is obtained as a gray to tan powder weighing 29.8\u201334.7 g. (58\u201368%) (Note 13).\nFigure 1."

The resulting solution is stirred as 700 ml. (0.280 mole) of 0.400 M sodium ethoxide in ethanol (Note 5) and (Note 6) is added dropwise over 1.5 hours. The off-white silver salt begins to precipitate after ca. 140 ml. of the sodium ethoxide solution has been added. Stirring is continued for 45 minutes after the addition is completed, and the reaction mixture is then stored in a refrigerator at ca. 5\u00b0 overnight to complete the precipitation and aggregation of the product.\nThe precipitate is collected on filter paper (Note 7) in a B\u00fcchner funnel by vacuum filtration and washed with 100 ml. of absolute ethanol. The solid is slurried in three 75-ml. portions of distilled water (Note 8), 100 ml. of absolute ethanol, two 100-ml. portions of reagent grade acetone, and two 100-ml. portions of anhydrous ethyl ether. The filter cake is pressed dry in the funnel with suction using a piece of rubber dam, transferred to a tared, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, and dried under reduced pressure (0.01 mm.) at room temperature for 24 hours (Note 9), yielding 51\u201354 g.

The solid is suspended in 295 ml. of dry chloroform (Note 11), and 51.4 g. (26.4 ml., 0.330 mole) of ethyl iodide is added in one portion. The flask is covered with aluminum foil, and the mixture is stirred vigorously and heated under reflux for 48 hours. The mixture is cooled, the silver iodide is removed by vacuum filtration through Celite, and the filter cake is washed well with dry chloroform. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a mixture of a dark liquid and a white solid identified as succinimide. Anhydrous diethyl ether is added to dissolve the liquid, and the resulting suspension is filtered through a plug of glass wool, separating 7.7\u201311.5 g. of succinimide. The ether is removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation at aspirator pressure, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure with a short-path distillation apparatus. The product is collected at 74\u201382\u00b0 (0.01 mm.) as a faintly yellow oil which crystallizes in the freezer. The yield is 11.5\u201316.7 g.

A three-necked, cylindrical irradiation vessel is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a water-jacketed quartz immersion well, an inert gas-inlet, and a gas-exit tube connected to a bubbler (Note 14). The vessel is charged with 6.26 g. (0.0493 mole) of redistilled 2-ethoxypyrrolin-5-one (Note 20) and 180 ml. of dry tert-butyl alcohol (Note 15). The solution is stirred and degassed by bubbling nitrogen or argon through the gas-inlet tube for 15 minutes. The degassed solution is stirred and irradiated with ultraviolet light from a 450-watt, Hanovia, medium-pressure, mercury lamp filtered through a Vycor glass sleeve. During the irradiation an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon is maintained, and the lamp is cooled with warm water (35\u201340\u00b0) circulated through the cooling jacket of the immersion well. The progress of the irradiation is monitored by GC (Note 16). When 90% of the 2-ethoxypyrrolin-5-one has reacted, the irradiation is stopped. The solution (Note 17) is transferred to a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an air-cooled reflux condenser mounted with a T-shaped nitrogen inlet. Nitrogen is passed through the apparatus for 30 minutes, after which the solution is stirred and heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 hours (Note 18). The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residual orange oil is refrigerated to induce crystallization. Sublimation of the solid at 35\u201340\u00b0 (0.05 mm.) affords 5.5\u20136.3 g.

(98\u2013100%) (Note 6). The oily product, which may solidify (Note 7) on standing for several days, is used directly in step B.",
            "B. S-Acetamidomethyl-L-cysteine hydrochloride. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask is charged with 127 g. (1.43 moles) of N-(hydroxymethyl)acetamide, 228 g. (1.30 moles) of L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Note 8), and 350 ml. of water. The resulting solution is swirled and cooled in an ice bath as 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is slowly added (Note 9). The flask is flushed with nitrogen, capped with a nitrogen-filled balloon, and allowed to stand for 1\u20132 days at room temperature. The progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC (Note 10). When L-cysteine hydrochloride is no longer detectable, the solution is evaporated under reduced pressure at a bath temperature of ca. 40\u00b0. The remaining solid is suspended in a small amount of absolute ethanol, and the mixture is again carefully evaporated to avoid bumping. This entrainment procedure with absolute ethanol is repeated several times to remove traces of water. The dry solid is dissolved in the minimum amount of methanol (Note 11), and anhydrous diethyl ether is added until the cloud point is reached. The cloudy solution is allowed to stand in a refrigerator at ca. 4\u20135\u00b0 for 1 week, during which the crystalline mass is broken up several times. The white crystalline product is collected, washed with ether, and dried under reduced pressure, yielding 152\u2013190 g.

The flask is illuminated with a 100-W., high-pressure, mercury-vapor lamp (Note 3) placed beside it (Note 4) and (Note 5). The methyl chloroformate is stirred and irradiated as a slow stream of chlorine (Note 6) is passed into the flask through the gas-inlet tube (Note 7). When the temperature reaches 30\u00b0 due to the exothermic reaction, the flask is immersed in a water bath (Note 8). The chlorine is then passed into the solution more rapidly so as to maintain the temperature at 30\u201335\u00b0 (Note 9). After ca. 6.5\u20137 hours the colorless solution assumes the pale yellow-green color of chlorine, which indicates that the end point of the reaction has been reached (Note 10).

The electrode assembly is inserted so that the platinum electrodes are immersed in the solution. A thermometer and reflux water condenser are attached. The mixture is heated to 60\u00b0C and stirred until the sodium methoxide dissolves.\nThe mixture is electrolyzed with a constant current of 1.1 A (Note 3) until GLC analysis (Note 4) of the solution shows the absence of the peak due to methyl hydrogen hexanedioate. This requires about 23 hr; electrolysis is continued for an additional 2.5 hr at the same current (Note 5). Throughout the electrolysis the reaction mixture is maintained at 62\u201365\u00b0C by passage of the current. After about 1 hr of electrolysis, when conditions are stabilized, the reaction may be left unattended.\nThe yellow reaction mixture is allowed to cool and then is acidified with 20 mL of glacial acetic acid. The acidified solution is transferred with methanol washing to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and evaporated (70\u201380\u00b0C, 12 mm) to dryness. The solid residue is stirred with 500 mL of diethyl ether for 1 hr. Undissolved solids are removed by filtration and the residue is washed twice with 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and washings are washed with aqueous sodium carbonate until neutral and then three times with 200-mL portions of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate. Filtration and evaporation of the ether afford a yellow oil that is distilled under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column (30 \u00d7 2.5 cm).

The products are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel with 250 mL of water and shaken. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with 25 mL of petroleum ether (Note 4). The organic fractions are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated in vacuo, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column. A forerun at about 50\u00b0C (16 mm) consists mainly of styrene. Distillation of the remainder affords 80\u201382 g (86\u201388%) of dichlorophenylcyclopropane, bp 118\u2013120\u00b0C (16 mm) (Note 5).\nB. Atropaldehyde diethyl acetal. A mixture of 18.7 g (0.100 mol) of 1,1-dichloro-2-phenylcyclopropane, 16 g (0.40 mol) of sodium hydroxide, and 160 mL of ethanol is placed in a 250-mL flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hr. Some bumping may occur. Water (200 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with three 30-mL portions of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, dried as above with magnesium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column. The acetal begins to distill at about 70\u00b0C (0.5 mm), and the product (14\u201315 g) is collected until the temperature reaches about 100\u00b0C. Gas chromatographic analysis of the product shows it to be about 85% pure (yield 58\u201362%) (Note 6).\nC. Atropaldehyde. The acetal (15 g), placed in a 100-mL flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer, is cooled to about 4\u00b0C in an ice bath. A mixture of 15 mL of formic acid and 4 mL of water is similarly cooled and added in one lot with stirring to the acetal. The temperature drops to about \u22124\u00b0C. The homogenous mixture is stirred for 60 sec and then quenched by adding 15 mL of petroleum ether and 25 mL of water. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken. The aqueous phase is extracted with two additional 15-mL portions of petroleum ether, and the combined extracts are dried as above with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo (Note 7). A mixture of 10 mL each of petroleum ether and diethyl ether is added to the crude aldehyde, and the solution is cooled to about \u221250\u00b0C. After 15 min the colorless crystals are filtered and washed with a few milliliters of the solvent cooled to 0\u00b0C. The yield of vacuum-dried product (Note 7) is 5.8\u20136.8 g (71\u201383%). Recrystallization from a mixture of 10 mL each of diethyl ether and petroleum ether as above gives 5\u20136 g, mp 38\u201340\u00b0C (Note 8) and (Note 9)."

The formation of cyclobutanol can be observed nearly instantaneously, as this alcohol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates (Note 2). The flask is then immersed in an ice bath equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel (using a three-way adapter, parallel sidearm), and the reflux condenser is replaced by an ethanol\u2013dry ice trap connected to a U-tube immersed in an ethanol\u2013dry ice bath to ensure condensation of the very volatile cyclobutanone. The flask is charged with an additional 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 mL of water and 440 g (3.5 mol) of oxalic acid dihydrate (Note 1). The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for ca. 15 min to saturate the solution with oxalic acid. A solution of 162 g (1.62 mol) of chromium trioxide in 250 mL of water is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 10\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C (NaCl\u2013ice bath, \u22125\u00b0C to \u221210\u00b0C) and the generation of carbon dioxide remains gentle. The reduction of each drop of chromic acid is practically instantaneous. As the addition of the reagent proceeds (1.5\u20132 hr), oxalic acid gradually dissolves and a dark-blue solution containing chromium(III) salts results (Note 3). Just before the end of the oxidation (ca. 10 mL of the chromic acid solution left), the cyclobutanone (with traces of cyclobutanol) trapped in the U-tube (a few milliliters) is added to the reaction mixture. After the oxidation is completed, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for ca. 1 hr to bring the reaction mixture to room temperature and to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution.\nThe reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with four 200-mL portions of methylene chloride (Note 4). The extracts (the lower phase) are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate containing a small amount of anhydrous potassium carbonate (to remove traces of hydrochloric acid), and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated by distillation through a vacuum-insulated silvered column (20-cm length, 1-cm i.d.) packed with glass helices (size 2.3 mm, Lab Glass, Inc.) and equipped with an adjustable stillhead, until the pot temperature rises to 80\u00b0C (Note 5). The crude product is then transferred to a 100-mL flask and distilled through the same column (reflux ratio 10:1) to give 14\u201316 g (0.20\u20130.23 mol), 31\u201335% overall yield (based on pure cyclopropyl carbinol) of cyclobutanone, bp 98\u201399\u00b0C, d254 0.926, n25D 1.4190 (Note 6).

The mixture is heated to 230\u00b0C with a metal bath. Drops of liquid appear on the condenser, and the aldehyde and water distill into the receiver. The temperature of the distillate oscillates between 50 and 100\u00b0C. Each time the distillation stops, 5\u201310 \u03bcL of boron trifluoride butyl etherate is added to the distilling flask (Note 9). The distillate is transferred into a separatory funnel and sodium chloride is added. The organic layer is decanted and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with 25-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic solution is dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 15-cm, helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The residue consists of practically pure cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde, 17.5\u201321.6 g (65\u201380%) (Note 10)."

Manipulations with this reagent should be performed with great care.\nA dry, 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen (admitted through a hypodermic needle in the septum). A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. The flask is charged with 420 mL of tetrahydrofuran (Note 1), and the solvent is cooled to \u221262\u00b0C in an acetone\u2013dry ice bath. Tungsten hexachloride (60g, 0.15 mol) (Note 2) is then introduced. While the cold suspension is stirred, 31 mL (0.30 mol) of 90% butyllithium in hexane (Note 3) is added slowly from a hypodermic syringe. The rate of addition (complete in ca. 5 min) is such that the temperature remains below \u221215\u00b0C. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. The green-brown viscous suspension becomes a dark-brown homogeneous solution that eventually turns green at room temperature. Because the reaction with the epoxide is exothermic, the flask is momentarily returned to the acetone\u2013dry ice bath while 14.8 g (0.081 mol) of trans-cyclododecene oxide (Note 4) and (Note 5) is introduced with a hypodermic syringe. The cooling bath is again removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature. After 30 min (Note 6) the mixture is poured into 600 mL of an aqueous solution that is 1.5 M in sodium tartrate and 2 M in sodium hydroxide (Note 7), and extracted with 240 mL of hexane. The organic phase is washed with a mixture of 160 mL of water and 80 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator.

            "Caution! The reaction described in Step A should be conducted in a hood, since some carbon monoxide is generated by partial decarbonylation of pivaloyl chloride.\nA. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate (1). The center neck of a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer port, magnetic stirrer bar coated with Teflon, and heating mantle is fitted with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The two side necks are fitted with 7 cm (diam) \u00d7 27 cm dry ice condensers vented through oil-filled bubblers into traps containing aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide (Note 1). A thermometer is placed in the thermometer port to extend nearly to the bottom of the flask without contacting the stirrer bar. The apparatus is purged with dry nitrogen, the nitrogen flow is stopped, and to the flask are added 300 g (2.5 mol) of pivaloyl chloride and 46 g (0.62 mol) of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol (Note 2). The condensers are charged with isopropyl alcohol-dry ice and, with stirring, the reaction mixture is warmed to 85\u00b0C. Heating is discontinued, and the mantle is allowed to remain in place. Then 187.5 g (109 mL, 1.25 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is added with stirring during a period of 2\u20133 min (Note 3). After the addition is complete, the temperature is maintained at 95\u2013105\u00b0C for 10 min with the heating mantle. The mantle is removed, and the brown reaction mixture is first allowed to spontaneously cool to 50\u00b0C and finally cooled to \u221210\u00b0C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry-ice bath. On addition of 1 L of cold diethyl ether (Note 4), a precipitate forms immediately and is collected, washed with three 300-mL portions of diethyl ether, and air-dried on a medium-porosity fritted-glass filter to give 118\u2013137 g (53\u201362%) of light tan 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate, mp 153\u2013164\u00b0C (Note 5).\nB. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (2). To 119\u2013128 g (0.33\u20130.36 mol) of crude pyrylium salt in a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer is added 2 L of 95% ethanol. The mixture is cooled to \u221260\u00b0C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath and to the fine slurry is added, with stirring, in one portion 1 L of concentrated (d 0.90) ammonium hydroxide also cooled to \u221260\u00b0C. The yellow reaction mixture is held at \u221260\u00b0C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to \u221240\u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 2 hr, during which time the slurry dissolves. The mixture is then allowed to spontaneously warm to room temperature (Note 6). The reaction mixture is divided into two portions. Each portion is poured into a 4-L separatory funnel, 1 L of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is extracted with four 250-mL portions of pentane (Note 7). The extracts from both portions are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator (Note 8), leaving a residual light-yellow oil that is dissolved in 150 mL of pentane and introduced slowly during 20\u201330 min onto the top of a 40 \u00d7 4.5 cm water-jacketed chromatography column (Note 9) containing 300 g of activated alumina (Note 10). After the solution has been added, the column is filled with pentane and a 1-L constant-pressure addition funnel, also filled with pentane, is fitted to the top of the column to provide a slight head pressure. The elution is completed in ca. 90 min. All the pyridine is obtained in the first 2 L of eluant (Note 11). The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator to yield 62.7\u201366.3 g (90\u201393%) of a colorless, odorless oil that solidifies on cooling or standing, mp 31\u201332\u00b0C (Note 12)."

            "A. 1,2,4,5-Hexatetraene in ether solution. A 2-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite), a dropping funnel, and a thermometer (Note 1). The flask is charged with 0.5 g (0.002 mol) of mercury(II) chloride and 29.2 g (1.2 mol) of magnesium turnings that have been crushed with a mortar and pestle, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen while being heated externally with a Bunsen burner to remove traces of moisture. In the cooled flask are placed 160 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether (Note 2) and 7.6 g (5.0 mL, 0.064 mol) of propargyl bromide (Note 3). The ether begins to reflux within 1 min, indicating that formation of the Grignard reagent has begun (Note 4). The mixture is cooled to 5\u00b0 in an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as a solution of 135 g (89 mL, 1.13 mol) of propargyl bromide in 560 mL of anhydrous ether is added. The addition rate is adjusted so as to maintain the internal temperature between 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C (Note 5). The cooling bath is removed, and the dark green mixture is stirred for 45 min at room temperature (Note 6). A 2-g (0.02 mol) portion of finely pulverized, dry copper(I) chloride (Note 7) is added, and the mixture, which becomes a chocolate-brown color after 2\u20133 min, is stirred for 15 min at room temperature and cooled again to 5\u00b0C with either an ice-water bath or an ice-salt bath. Stirring is continued while a solution of 128 g (85 mL, 1.08 mol) of propargyl bromide in 100 mL of ether is added at a rate such that the internal temperature is kept at ca. 20\u00b0C (Note 8). The mixture becomes almost black, and two phases are discernible when the stirrer is stopped, especially toward the end of the addition. The cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 15 min at room temperature to complete the dimerization. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0C with an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as 200 mL of 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid is added (Note 9). The two-phase mixture is warmed to room temperature, and another 100 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid is added. The ether layer is separated and washed with three 100-mL portions of water (Note 10). A few crystals (0.2\u20130.5 g) of hydroquinone are added to stabilize the reddish solution, which is then dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate. The drying agent is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to a volume of ca. 400 mL by distillation under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure with a 40-cm Vigreux column and a heating bath kept at 40\u201345\u00b0C. The concentrate is purified by vacuum transfer (Note 11), and the now colorless solution, which contains ca. 25\u201330 g (30\u201336%) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene, is stabilized by adding another 0.1\u20130.5 g of hydroquinone (Note 12) and (Note 13).\nB. Tetramethyl[2.2]paracyclophane-4,5,12,13-tetracarboxylate. The 1-L flask from Step A containing ca. 25\u201330 g (0.32\u20130.38 mol) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene in ether solution is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 40-cm Vigreux column for distillation at atmospheric pressure. A solution of 69.4 g (60 mL, 0.49 mol) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (Note 14) in 220 mL of benzene (Note 15) is added. The resulting solution is stirred and heated at 45\u00b0C for 5\u20137 hr and at 70\u00b0C for 20 hr (Note 16). The ether distils slowly at 45\u00b0C and rather rapidly at 70\u00b0C, the color of the solution changes from yellow to red\u2013orange, and a white solid is gradually deposited. The mixture is cooled and filtered. Recrystallization of the solid from 600\u2013800 mL of toluene affords 27\u201335 g of white crystalline product, mp 201.5\u2013203\u00b0C. The original benzene filtrate and the toluene mother liquor, when evaporated to dryness and crystallized separately from 40\u201370 mL of toluene, provide 3\u20134 g and 2\u20133 g of product, respectively, having essentially the same melting point. The combined yield is 33\u201341 g (40\u201350% based on 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene) (Note 17) and (Note 18)."

            "Caution! Phenylchlorodiazirine is highly explosive (Note 6). It should always be handled with adequate shielding and normal protective equipment such as face shield and leather gloves.\nBenzene has been identified as a carcinogen; OSHA has issued emergency standards on its use. All procedures involving benzene should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood, and glove protection is required.\nA 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a high-speed mechanical stirrer and a 250-mL pressure-equalized dropping funnel is charged with 22.5 g (0.143 mol) of benzamidine hydrochloride (Note 1), 37.5 g (0.62 mol) of sodium chloride, 300 mL of hexane, and 400 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. The flask is cooled at 0\u00b0C in an ice\u2013salt bath (Note 2), and a mixture containing 15.5 g (2.65 mol) of sodium chloride in 1.2 L of aqueous 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (Note 3) is added with vigorous stirring over a 15-min period using the dropping funnel. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 15 min. At this time the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 75-mL portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are combined with the organic phase and the mixture is washed successively four times with 125-mL portions of water and once with a 125-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The mixture is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a volume of approximately 75 mL at 25\u00b0C under aspirator vacuum. The mixture is filtered through a 3-cm \u00d7 14-cm column of silica gel (Note 4) and eluted with 200 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 5) into a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask. Concentration under reduced pressure at room temperature to a volume of approximately 50 mL yields a yellow solution (Note 6). The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, heating mantle, and reflux condenser protected from the atmosphere by a calcium chloride drying tube and then charged with 600 mL of anhydrous benzene (Note 5) and 7.49 g (0.0634 mol) of trans-\u03b2-methylstyrene.\nThe reaction mixture is then heated at reflux for 3.5 hr and allowed to cool to 25\u00b0C. The benzene is removed at 25\u00b0C on a rotary evaporator to afford a dark-brown oil. This was diluted with 50 mL of ether, filtered through a 3-cm \u00d7 14-cm column of silica gel (Note 4), and eluted with an additional 175 mL of ether. Removal of the ether under reduced pressure yields ca. 21 g of an oily orange solid that consists of a mixture of diastereomeric 1-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropanes (Note 7).\nThe crude mixture is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a calcium chloride drying tube. To the flask is added 450 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 8), and the mixture is cooled to \u221278\u00b0C in a dry ice\u2013acetone bath. The drying tube is removed for a brief period, and 28.5 g (0.25 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide (Note 9) is quickly added in one portion using a powder funnel. The reaction is stirred for 1 hr at \u221278\u00b0C, warmed to 0\u00b0C, stirred for 3 hr, and then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr. At the end of this time 60 mL of water is added slowly to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 25\u00b0C to a volume of ca. 150 mL. The mixture is taken up in 160 mL of ether and washed successively with six 60-mL portions of water and one 60-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The resulting dark-brown oil is chromatographed through a 4-cm \u00d7 41-cm column of silica gel (Note 10) with eluting with hexane. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure at 25\u00b0C affords 10.5\u201311.5 g (80\u201388%) of 1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropene as a pale yellow oil (Note 11)."

The two platinum anodes of the electrode assembly (Note 1) are positioned in a horizontal plane ca. 1 cm above (Note 4) the mercury (cathode) surface.\nTo the cell are added diethyl fumarate (172 g, 1.0 mol) (Note 5), absolute ethanol (200 mL), and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (3.41 g, 0.1 mol) (Note 6). The mixture is allowed to stand for 0.5 hr to allow complete dissolution of the tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The cell is placed in a flowing-water bath in a hood.\nThe solution is electrolyzed with continuous magnetic stirring and nitrogen purging at a constant current (Note 7) until the theoretical quantity of electricity (1.0F \u2261 1e\u2212 per mole of diethyl fumarate) has been passed. The rate at which the cooling water in the bath flows is adjusted to maintain the electrolyte solution at 35\u00b0C during the first 2 hr of the electrolysis. It is then kept constant for the remainder of the electrolysis. After conditions have stabilized (ca. 1\u20132 hr of electrolysis), the reaction does not need constant attention, and may be allowed to run overnight.\nThe reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask with ethanol washing and the ethanol is removed by rotatory evaporation. Diethyl ether (1 L) is added to precipitate the electrolyte salt, which is collected by filtration and washed with ether. The crude electrolyte is obtained as a white solid (32\u201332.5 g, theory 34.1 g). The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated to give a viscous brown oil, which was vacuum-distilled through a short Vigreux column (15 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm).

To the mixture is added dropwise over a 1-hr period and with external cooling 281 g (2.0 mol) of benzoyl chloride (Note 2), the temperature is maintained at 15\u201325\u00b0C. After addition is complete, stirring is continued for another hour at ambient temperature. With continued stirring 1 L of ether and 5 L of water are introduced, whereupon the temperature is brought to 5\u00b0C. The crystalline product is removed by filtration and is sucked dry with the aid of a rubber dam.

The mixture is stirred as the solids gradually dissolve. After 1 hr a clear yellow solution results, which is allowed to stand for another 5 hr, during which time white solid product begins to precipitate. Technical diethyl ether (1500 mL) is next added, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight.

Then 2 g of 10% palladium on carbon (Note 7) is cautiously added (Note 8). The reaction vessel is now attached to the Parr hydrogenator and, after alternate evacuation and flushing with hydrogen gas, is shaken under a 50-psi atmosphere of hydrogen. Gas uptake ceases after absorption of 1 mol-equiv per mole of substrate; this requires ca. 2 hr. The catalyst is removed by vacuum filtration through Hyflow, the filtercake is rinsed with three portions of 95% ethyl alcohol (Note 9), and the filtrate is stripped to leave solid, impure product.

The mixture is then chilled on ice, causing deposition of benzoic acid, which is removed by filtration (Note 11). The filtrate, on evaporation, leaves a residue that is first digested with 100 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol and then cooled on ice. The remaining solids are essentially pure ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and are filtered off (Note 12). Filtrate solvent is again removed under reduced pressure to leave solid residue. This is dissolved in 40 mL of water. Addition of solid sodium bicarbonate until foaming ceases causes imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde to crystallize.

            "The preparation is carried out in a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with two graphite rod electrodes (Note 1). To the flask are added 132 g (1.0 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-propanedioate (Note 2), 15 g (0.10 mol) of sodium iodide, and 300 mL of methanol. A thermometer and reflux condenser are attached; the mixture is stirred and the solution formed is heated to 60\u00b0C. The heat source is removed. The solution is electrolyzed with a constant current of 2.0 A (Note 3) for 13.5 hr (Note 4) with gentle magnetic stirring. After a few minutes of electrolysis, the electrolyte begins to reflux gently and reflux is maintained throughout the electrolysis period by the heating effect of current passage (Note 5). Small granular crystals of the product begin to separate toward the end of the electrolysis period.\nAfter electrolysis the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered (Note 6). The crystalline residue is washed three times with 100-mL portions of methanol, dried by suction on the filter, and finally dried under vacuum. The product (88.4\u201391 g, 67\u201369%) is obtained as a white solid, mp 134\u2013135\u00b0C."

            "Caution! Acetylenic compounds are potentially explosive and methyl 4-hydroxy-2-butynoate is a potent vesicant (Note 1).\nA. Tetrahydropyranyl derivative of propargyl alcohol [tetrahydro-2-(2-propynyloxy)-2H-pyran]. Two crystals (ca. 10 mg) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added to 268 g (291.3 mL, 3.2 mol) of warm (60\u00b0C) dihydropyran (Note 2) in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a dropping funnel containing 168 g (174.5 mL, 3.0 mol) of propargyl alcohol (Note 2) and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube. Stirring is started, and the propargyl alcohol is added (Note 3) as a thin stream during a period of ca. 30 min. The reaction is mildly exothermic, and the temperature is maintained at 60\u201365\u00b0C by controlling the rate of addition of the propargyl alcohol and by occasional external cooling with an ice bath. After the addition is completed, the temperature is monitored for another 30 min; slight cooling is sometimes necessary to keep the temperature in the range of 60\u201365\u00b0C. The reaction mixture is stirred for a total of 1.5 hr after the addition is completed, and then 0.5 g of powdered sodium bicarbonate is added and the mixture stirred for another hour. The mixture is then gravity-filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. The reaction mixture is distilled through a 45-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure (Note 15). A small forerun (ca. 40 mL) with a bp of 45\u00b0C (15\u201320 mm) is followed by the product, bp 47\u201350\u00b0C (3.5\u20135 mm), 330\u2013355 g (78\u201392%) (Note 15); n22D 1.4559 (Note 16); 1H NMR (90 MHz, neat) \u03b4: 1.18\u20131.93 (br m, 6, H2',2'', H3',3'', H4',4''); 2.47 (t, 1, J = 2, C\u2261C-H), 3.17\u20133.84 (m, 2, H5',5''), 4.03 (d, 2, J = 2, C\u2261C-CH2O), 4.63 (s, 1, H1); IR (neat) cm\u22121: 3300 (C\u2261C-H), 2117 (C\u2261C stretch).\nB. Methyl 4-hydroxy-2-butynoate. One mole of ethylmagnesium bromide (Note 4) in diethyl ether is poured into a dry (Note 5) 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a glass stirrer bearing (Note 6), a dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube, and an efficient condenser fitted with a drying tube. Stirring is started, and a solution of 140 g (1.0 mol, 141 mL) of the tetrahydropyranyl derivative of propargyl alcohol in 1-L of dry (Note 7) tetrahydrofuran is added during ca. 30 min (Note 8). Stirring is continued for an additional 1.5 hr, during which time a dry 3-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, immersion thermometer, and dropping funnel. The 3-L flask is charged with a solution of 104 g (1.10 mol, 85.4 mL) of methyl chloroformate (Note 2) in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the contents stirred and cooled to \u221220\u00b0C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Under gentle nitrogen pressure the acetylenic Grignard reagent is transferred portionwise through a \u00bc-in. polypropylene tube to the dropping funnel attached to the 3-L, three-necked flask (Note 9). The acetylenic Grignard reagent is then added dropwise during 1.5 hr to the well-stirred solution of methyl chloroformate in tetrahydrofuran while the temperature is maintained at \u221215 to \u221220\u00b0C by external cooling. After the addition is completed, the light-brown reaction mixture is stirred another 30 min at \u221215\u00b0C, followed by another 1.5 hr at ice temperature. The reaction mixture is then stored without stirring for 12 hr at +3\u00b0C, during which time the remaining magnesium salts separate from solution. The salts are removed by filtration (Note 10) and washed with three 150-mL portions of cold (0\u00b0C), dry toluene. The supernatant and washings are combined and concentrated (Note 11) to ca. 500-mL volume. The dark-brown solution is then washed five times with 100-mL portions of saturated brine followed by drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is concentrated to remove the toluene and then dissolved (Note 12) in 1 L of anhydrous methanol; 25 mL of Dowex 50-X4 cation resin (H+ form, prewashed with anhydrous methanol) is then added and the mixture stirred for 1.5 hr at 25\u00b0C. The ion-exchange resin is removed by filtration through a sintered-glass filter and is then washed with two 50-mL portions of anhydrous methanol. Solvent and 2-methoxytetrahydropyran are removed by concentration using a water aspirator and then an oil pump at 0.5-mm pressure. The residue from the concentration is then treated a second time (Note 13) with 1 L of anhydrous methanol and 25 mL of Dowex 50, followed by concentration as before. The residue is then distilled through a Claisen head to give methyl 4-hydroxy-2-butynoate (Note 14), 69\u201374 g (60\u201365%), by 66\u201369\u00b0C/0.2 mm, n22D 1.4684 (Note 17); 1H NMR [(CD3)2SO] \u03b4: 3.79 (s, 3, OCH3), 4.31 (d, 2, CH2, J = 6), 5.57 (t, 1, OH); IR (neat) cm\u22121: 3410 (OH), 2240 (-C\u2261C-), 1715 (ester)."

A solution of 7.30 g (0.05 mol) of \u03b1-tetralone (Note 3) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (Note 4) is added at room temperature. The N-methylanilinium trifluoroacetate dissolves, and the magnetically stirred mixture is refluxed for 4 hr under a nitrogen atmosphere (Note 5). During this time a red color develops and the paraformaldehyde dissolves after 2 hr. After 4 hr the heating oil bath is removed and the red solution allowed to cool for 10 min. Diethyl ether (100 mL) is gradually added under efficient magnetic stirring, which induces the separation of a red gum. The ethereal solution is decanted from the red gum into a separatory funnel and washed with 50 mL of half-saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The red gum is triturated with 50 mL of diethyl ether, and the resulting ethereal solution is then used to extract the washing water (Note 6). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and concentration of the extract, first on a rotary evaporator then under high vacuum, afford 8.05\u20138.6 g of a heavy red oil (Note 7). Trituration of this oil with 70 mL of diethyl ether precipitates impurities and causes some polymerization. Filtration through Celite and concentration under high vacuum give 6.8\u20137.2 g (86\u201391%) of material that solidifies in a freezer (Note 8). Further purification by column chromatography over silica gel affords analytically pure material (mp 46\u201346.5\u00b0C) but lowers the yield to 70\u201382%."

            "Caution! This procedure should be carried out in a hood since 2-nitropropene is a powerful lachrymator. Nitroolefins have a tendency to undergo \"fume-offs\" (which can be like explosions) near the end of a distillation, particularly if air is let in on a hot distillation residue (from a vacuum distillation).\nA 250 mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 96.5 g (0.65 mol) of phthalic anhydride (Note 1) and 52.5 g (0.50 mol) of 2-nitro-1-propanol (Note 2). A 10-cm vacuum-insulated Vigreux column, a stillhead fitted with a thermometer, a condenser, a 50-mL, round-bottomed receiving flask, and a water aspirator are installed in due order, and the reaction vessel is placed in an oil bath and evacuated to 110 mm (Note 3). The bath temperature is raised to 150\u00b0C and maintained for 30 min while the phthalic anhydride melts to give a homogeneous solution. The receiving flask is immersed in an ice bath, stirring is started, and the bath temperature is raised to 180\u00b0C. As the reaction mixture darkens, green-colored 2-nitropropene is gradually distilled off with water, bp 50\u201365\u00b0C (110 mm). The bath temperature is held at 180\u2013185\u00b0C until the distillation ceases (ca. 1 hr). The distillate is transferred into a 50-mL separatory funnel, and the lower layer is separated from water (Note 4) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Redistillation under reduced pressure through a 10-cm vacuum-insulated Vigreux column (Note 5) gives 25.0\u201331.4 g (57\u201372%) of 2-nitropropene, which is collected in an ice-cooled receiving flask as a transparent green liquid, bp 56\u201357\u00b0C (86 mm), nD20 1.4348 [lit.2 bp 58\u00b0C (90 mm), nD19 1.4292, d201.0492] (Note 5).

A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 125 mL of chloroform and 13 g (0.2 mol) of sodium azide. The mixture is cooled with an ice\u2013salt bath to \u22125\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C, and 37.5 mL (0.5 mol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added, followed after 5\u201310 min with 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of 2-phenyl-2-adamantanol (Note 1). The resulting slurry is stirred for 4 hr at 0\u00b0C and then allowed to reach room temperature overnight. The mixture is cautiously neutralized with a slight excess of 12\u201315% aqueous ammonia solution and transferred to a separatory funnel. The chloroform layer is separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted with 50 mL of chloroform. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of water, separated, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed in a rotary evaporator. The oily residue solidifies on cooling. The yield is 23.6\u201324.8 g (93\u201398%), mp 42\u201345\u00b0C. Recrystallization of a sample from 2-propanol raises the melting point to 47\u201348\u00b0C (Note 2).\nB. 2-Phenyl-2-adamantanamine hydrochloride. A solution of 24 g (0.095 mol) of the crude 2-azido-2-phenyladamantane in 75 mL of 2-propanol is placed in a 1-L beaker fitted with a mechanical stirrer, and heated in a water bath that can be removed quickly. Wet, active Raney nickel (Note 3) and (Note 4) is added in portions at 60\u201370\u00b0C with stirring until the evolution of nitrogen ceases (Note 5). The mixture is heated for an additional 10 min, filtered through a B\u00fcchner funnel, and washed with 75 mL of 2-propanol in such a manner that the catalyst is always covered with liquid (Note 6). The filtrate is concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The crude residue is dissolved in 75 mL of toluene and treated with 22 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid while stirring. The 2-phenyl-2-adamantanamine hydrochloride is collected, triturated with 50 mL of warm acetone, filtered again, and air-dried. The yield is 22.5\u201324.0 g (90\u201396%), and the product melts at 293\u2013296\u00b0C (closed capillary) (Note 7) and (Note 8)."

Boron trifluoride gas is highly corrosive; this preparation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood.\nA dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a gas-inlet tube (Note 1), a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a Dewar condenser cooled with ice-water and fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite). A solution of 20.9 g (0.180 mol) of triethylsilane (Note 2) in 80 mL of dichloromethane (Note 3) is placed in the flask. The solution is stirred rapidly and cooled in an ice bath while boron trifluoride gas (Note 4) is introduced below the surface of the liquid at a moderate rate. The first appearance of white fumes at the exit of the drying tube (Note 5) indicates that the solution is saturated and the apparatus is filled with boron trifluoride. The flow of boron trifluoride is adjusted to a level sufficient to maintain a slight emission of white fumes from the drying tube, and a solution of 10.0 g (0.0606 mol) of m-nitroacetophenone (Note 6) in 30 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise during 10 min. Stirring and cooling are continued for 30 min, after which the flow of boron trifluoride gas is stopped and the cooling bath is removed. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min, cooled again with the ice bath, and hydrolyzed by adding 20 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride. The upper organic layer is decanted from the salts, which are then dissolved in 50 mL of water. The aqueous solution is extracted with two 25-mL portions of pentane, which are combined with the original organic layer. The organic solution is washed with two 25-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate.

Anhydrous titanium trichloride (63.16 g, 0.409 mol) (Note 1) and (Note 2) is added to the weighed flask in an argon-filled glove bag. The flask is reweighed, and one of the rubber septa is replaced with a dry (12 hr at 120\u00b0C) reflux condenser through which a stream of argon is flowing (Note 3). The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer equipped with a glass shaft and Teflon paddle (Note 4). Into the flask is syringed 600 mL of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Note 5), and the remaining rubber septum is exchanged for a glass stopper. Lithium (8.52 g, 1.23 mol) (Note 6) is etched to brilliance in methanol, quickly washed in petroleum ether (Note 7), and cut into small pieces directly into the stirred suspension. The mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr by an oil bath that is then removed (Note 8). Immediately after the solvent has ceased to reflux, 2-adamantanone (15.36 g, 0.102 mol) (Note 1) is added in one portion, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 18 hr.\nStirring is maintained as the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and 600 mL of petroleum ether (Note 7) is added in 100-mL portions at 5-min intervals (Note 9). The stirrer is disconnected from its motor, and the solution is poured into a sintered-glass funnel containing 50 g of Florisil (approximately 7 cm in depth) (Note 1). The black material remaining in the reaction vessel is washed with eight 50-mL portions of petroleum ether, which are poured into the same pad of Florisil (Note 10) and (Note 11). The filter pad is then washed with 400 mL of petroleum ether. Removal of the solvent from the combined filtrates by means of a rotary evaporator followed by high vacuum (0.05 mm) gives 12\u201313 g of a white crystalline solid. This crude product is dissolved in 3.5 L of hot methanol (Note 1), and the volume is reduced to 2 L by boiling. The solution is allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. The colorless needles are vacuum filtered through sintered glass (medium frit) and washed with 50 mL of ice-cold methanol.

Then 20.0 mL (21.0 g, 0.23 mol) of 2-nitropropene (Note 3) is added through the rubber septum by a syringe over a period of 5\u201310 min, giving a green solution. The reaction mixture is further stirred at \u221278\u00b0C for 20 min, and then the silyl enol ether is added dropwise to the mixture over 1 hr, giving a faint yellow solution. After completion of the addition the resulting solution is stirred at ca. \u221278\u00b0C for an additional hour; then the bath temperature is gradually warmed to \u22125\u00b0C over a period of 3\u20133.5 hr while the stirring is continued (Note 4). The inert gas flow is stopped, the dropping funnel is replaced by a condenser, the magnetic stirrer is removed, and the flask is equipped with a heating mantle and an overhead stirring device. Then 280 mL of water are added, and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred at reflux for 2 hr (Note 5). The mixture is subsequently cooled to room temperature and then poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the methylene chloride layer is separated from the water. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 100 mL of methylene chloride, and the combined organic layers are washed twice with 160-mL portions of cold water (Note 6) and once with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residual oil is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure to yield 18.7\u201321.5 g (61\u201370%) of 2-(2-oxopropyl)cyclohexanone as a fragrant yellow liquid, bp 84\u201385\u00b0C (0.8 mm), nD19 1.4671 [lit.2 bp 91\u201393\u00b0C (1.1 mm), nD25 1.4655] (Note 7)."

            "Caution! All operations should be carried out in a hood! m-Trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride is a lachrymator. Spills should be treated with saturated sodium carbonate.\n\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-Trifluoro-m-toluidine (m-aminobenzotrifluoride) (96.7 g, 0.6 mol) (Note 1) is added in one portion to a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid (200 mL) and glacial acetic acid (60 mL) in a 1000-mL beaker arranged for efficient mechanical stirring (Note 2). The white hydrochloride salt precipitates (Note 3). The beaker is placed in a dry ice-ethanol bath and, when the temperature of the stirred mixture has reached \u221210\u00b0C, a solution of sodium nitrite (44.8 g, 0.65 mol) in water (65 mL) is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed \u22125\u00b0C (Note 4). After all the sodium nitrite solution has been added, the mixture is stirred for 45 min while the temperature is maintained between \u221210\u00b0C and \u22125\u00b0C (Note 5).\nWhile the diazotization is being completed, glacial acetic acid (600 mL) is placed in a 4000-mL beaker and stirred magnetically. Sulfur dioxide is introduced by a bubbler tube with a fritted end immersed below the surface of the acetic acid until saturation is evident (Note 6). Cuprous chloride (15 g) (Note 7) is added to the solution. The introduction of sulfur dioxide is continued until the yellow\u2013green suspension becomes blue-green. Most of the solids dissolve during this time (20\u201330 min). The mixture is then placed in an ice bath and cooled with stirring. When the temperature approaches 10\u00b0C, the diazotization reaction mixture (Note 8) is added in portions over a 30-min period to the sulfur dioxide solution. Considerable foaming occurs after each addition, and this can be disrupted with a few drops of ether. The temperature rises during the addition, but it should not exceed 30\u00b0C. After all the diazonium salt mixture has been added, the mixture is poured into ice water (1 : 1, 2000 mL), stirred magnetically until the ice has melted, and added to a 4000-mL separatory funnel. The product separates as a yellow oil that is drawn off. The reaction mixture is extracted with 200-mL portions of ether until the ether washings are colorless (Note 9), and these washings are added to the initial product. The combined organic fraction is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until neutral (Note 10), then with water, and is then dried with magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled (bp 54\u201355\u00b0C, 0.1 mm) through a 10-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give m-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (100\u2013115 g, 68\u201379%) as a colorless or slightly yellow, clear liquid (Note 11), (Note 12)."

            "A. Trimethylsilyl cyanide. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and a 60-mL addition funnel is charged with 5.0 g (0.624 mol) of lithium hydride (Note 1) and 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (Note 2). The stirred suspension is cooled in an ice bath and 42.6 g of acetone cyanohydrin (45.7 mL, 0.501 mol) (Note 3) is added dropwise over 15 min. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture stirred for 2 hr at room temperature (Note 4). The magnetic stirring bar is removed and the solvent evaporated as completely as possible on a rotary evaporator. The white lithium cyanide is then dried in vacuo for 3 hr (Note 5) and (Note 6). The lithium cyanide is freed from the sides of the flask and broken up with a spatula (Note 7). A 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with an ice bath, magnetic stirrer, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 54.32 g (63.46 ml, 0.500 mol) of trimethylchlorosilane (Note 8) and 100 mL of bis[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl] ether (Note 9). The lithium cyanide is added to this stirred solution over 15 min through Gooch tubing (Note 10). After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the milky suspension stirred overnight at room temperature. The Gooch tubing and the thermometer are then removed from the reaction flask and a stillhead equipped for downward vacuum distillation is attached. A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask immersed halfway in an acetone-dry ice slush bath (Note 11) is employed as the receiver. The volatile compounds are distilled under a pressure of 50 mm (bp 25\u201355\u00b0C) by heating the contents of the pot using an oil bath (Note 12). The distillate is carefully redistilled through a well-insulated 15-cm column packed with glass helices under an inert atmosphere. A 25\u201340 mL forerun (bp 66\u2013113\u00b0C), consisting primarily of tetrahydrofuran and hexamethyldisiloxane, is first collected. The second fraction, containing 29\u201341 g (59\u201382%) of trimethylsilyl cyanide, bp 114\u2013117\u00b0C, nD25 1.3902 (Note 13), then distills. A purity of ca. 97% was established by GC analysis (Note 14) and (Note 15); the product is suitable for synthetic use without further purification.",
            "B. Cyanosilylation of p-benzoquinone. A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, West condenser, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with 6.30 g (58.2 mmol) of p-benzoquinone (Note 16), 10 mL of dry carbon tetrachloride, and 8 mL (63.03 mmol) of trimethylsilyl cyanide. The stirred suspension is heated to a gentle reflux by means of a heat gun to dissolve all the p-benzoquinone. It is then allowed to cool slowly until the crystallization of the p-benzoquinone starts (Note 17), at which time 5 mg of the 1 : 1 complex between potassium cyanide and 18-crown-6 (Note 18) is added through the top of the condenser. An immediate vigorous reflux sets in and continues for 1\u20132 min (Note 19). The stirred reaction mixture is permitted to cool slowly to room temperature, whereupon the condenser is removed and 3 g of Florisil (Note 20) is added. After stirring for an additional 15 min, 10 mL of dry carbon tetrachloride is added. The suspension is then filtered and the filtercake leached with three 5-mL portions of carbon tetrachloride. The solvent is evaporated from the filtrate as completely as possible on a rotary evaporator, at which point crystallization of the residue usually begins (Note 21). The last traces of solvent and trimethylsilyl cyanide are then removed in vacuo over 20 hr at 50 \u03bc to afford 12.0\u201312.2 g of crude product. The trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin is recrystallized by dissolving the crude material in 25 mL of hot hexane and allowing the resulting solution to cool slowly to room temperature (Note 22). After collection by filtration the product is rinsed with two 5-mL portions of hexane and airdried to yield 7.54\u20139.77 g (63%\u201381%) of white to buff-colored needles, mp 65\u201367\u00b0C (Note 23) and (Note 24)."
