# ReactionSeek: LLM-Powered Literature Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Organic Synthesis

## Project overview
ReactionSeek automates the multi-modal extraction of chemical data from scientific literature. It employs a hybrid architecture that combines the contextual understanding of LLMs with the chemical precision of established cheminformatics tools. ReactionSeek utilizes a domain-specific prompt engineering strategy, enabling robust and accurate data mining without the need for resource-intensive model fine-tuning.
